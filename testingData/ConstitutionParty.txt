Censorship of conservatives Hey everyone, what’s your opinion on the rise of censorship of conservatives and their resources? Was the event at the Capitol reason enough to further censorship? Are conservative sites (like Parler) echo chambers that create extremists? Or should there be no online censorship at all?
Storming the Capitol I’m fairly new here. How do you all feel about the conservative groups that stormed the Capitol? Was this justified? If not, how should the populace retaliate against a system they see as corrupt?
How can we win? Right now I support the Republicans because they align with most of my policies so with the defeat of Donald Trump (Unless he somehow pulls it off and is able to get in) and he doesn't get nominated in 2024 (and doesn't make his own party) or doesn't run in 2024, there will be a lot of Republicans looking towards other parties (including myself) so how will we win any future elections? Will we be able to capitalize on this opportunity or will we start with local first and move our way up or go directly for national?

Establishing parities in US territories For context, I do not live in any US territory, but I think the best way going forward for the party’s growth going forward is the establish parties in US territories. Most of them tend to be very third party friendly. There is one caveat and that due to the statuses of US territories, they will have issues that do not necessarily apply to the mainland. If you know anyone in any US territories and they are interested in starting a US territorial party, have them get into contact with the national committee.
Good Luck Today Wishing you good luck from the UK. I hope this year you make a gain from the 0.15% of the vote received on 2016.  Growing is winning and never give up or feel deflated. Go out, vote Blankenship.
Post from the Mod for the 2020 Election It's been my pleasure to run this sub during this election cycle. Please vote for Don if he is on the ballot or as a write-in in your state.If you can't vote for Don because he Isn't on your ballot I believe the best alternative is to stomach a vote for Trump. You should also vote down ballot CP if your state party is running candidates. All of this will help grow the party so that we can have an alternative conservative party.I will late be posting election results for Don later as the come in. Happy election day!

Devoter: Getting more people to vote third-party by overcoming their number one objection Devoter is a voting strategy website designed to get more mainstream voters to vote third-party by overcoming their number one objection: that voting third-party is "throwing your vote away." Devoter does this by providing voters with the philosophy and means for pairing themselves with people they already know but who are on the opposite side of the left-right divide. Instead of canceling each other's vote at the ballot box, "devoting" involves collaborating beforehand to vote for **neither** of the two-party candidates, freeing each voter to vote for their preferred third-party candidate instead. Check it out, and help spread the word at [Devoter.us](https://devoter.us/).  https://preview.redd.it/x2dz7q25lbr51.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6abc9003bf8063acf45f9fd6bf99979cd2e72a78
What are your thoughts on ballet fusion?  If your not familiar some states (most notably New York) allows electoral fusion which means a candidate can show up on the ballot with multiple parties and all votes for that candidate are combined. [Here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election_in_New_York) is a link to the 2016 New York election results. In that state the conservative party is the third biggest party because people can still vote for Trump while making it clear where they stand on the issues. It also gives the minor parties some power over the two major parties by threatening to not endorse the major party candidate (ie. If the republican wasn't conservative enough).  If this were in every state it wouldn't drastically change anything but I could see it giving minor parties more influence over national elections.

In response major tobacco manufacturers like RJ Reynolds, the makers of Camel, Pall Mall, American Spirit and Newport and Philip Morris USA, the makers of Marlboro, L&M and owners of Black & Mild, as well as retailers such as independently owned convience stores have all filed lawsuits against the Federal Dick Association for their open war on the rights of Americans.   The FDA is now abusrdly claiming retailers like small businesses don't have a right to sue them alongside the big boys like RJ Reyndols and Philip Morris, and therefore the lawsuit over the right to fucking free speech should be thrown out by the US government and the FDA should do whatever it wants without anyone standing in their way, this is what Socialism unhinged in America looks like folks.

Why congressional members propaganda newspaper delivered to their office # Pelosi Asked to Stop China Daily Distribution to Hill Offices  BY [MARK TAPSCOTT](https://www.theepochtimes.com/author-mark-tapscott) June 25, 2020 Updated: June 25, 2020  [Print](https://www.theepochtimes.com/pelosi-ignores-gop-congressmen-urging-her-to-stop-china-daily-distribution-to-hill-offices_3402264.html?ref=brief_News&__sta=vhg.uosvpxUlkgswud%7CQYJ&__stm_medium=email&__stm_source=smartech#Print)  Speaker of the House [Nancy Pelosi](https://www.theepochtimes.com/t-nancy-pelosi) (D-Calif.) is keeping silent in response to the urging of an Indiana Republican and four colleagues that she end distribution of [China Daily](https://www.theepochtimes.com/t-china-daily), a Chinese regime propaganda outlet, to congressional offices.  “I sent letters to Congress’s Chief Administrative Officer and to the Chairperson and Ranking Member of the Committee on House Administration asking for help,” Rep. [Jim Banks](https://www.theepochtimes.com/t-jim-banks) (R-Ind.) told Pelosi earlier this week in a letter first [reported](https://freebeacon.com/national-security/letter-demands-pelosi-halt-chinese-propaganda-push-on-capitol-hill/) by the Washington Free Beacon.  “Unfortunately, I didn’t receive any; so, I’m turning to you as Speaker of the House. I ask you: How is Chinese propaganda arriving on my doorstep each morning when the Capitol is closed to the public? And what are you going to do about it?”  Ashley Etienne, Pelosi’s communications director, didn’t immediately respond to The Epoch Times’ request for comment on Banks’s letter. Also signing the letter to Pelosi were Republican Reps. Greg Steube of Florida, Brian Babin of Texas, Ralph Norman of South Carolina, and Mike Johnson of Louisiana.  Rep. Chuck Fleishmann (R-Tenn.), a member of the House Appropriations Committee, echoed Banks’s concerns in an email to The Epoch Times.  “China Daily is a state-run media outlet and registered foreign agent under FARA, they are not even credentialed by the congressional press galleries,” he said. “So why is their propaganda on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party \[CCP\] distributed to members of Congress? This is something that needs to be looked into.”  After designating China Daily and four other Chinese outlets as foreign missions earlier this year, the State Department announced June 22 it was adding four more Chinese government-controlled entities to the list.  “Over the past decade and particularly under General Secretary Xi Jinping’s tenure, the CCP has reorganized China’s state propaganda outlets disguised as news agencies and asserted even more direct control over them,” State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said in a June 22 [statement](https://www.state.gov/designation-of-additional-chinese-media-entities-as-foreign-missions/).  “He has stated, ‘party-owned media must … embody the party’s will, safeguard the party’s authority … their actions must be highly consistent with the party.’ In short, while Western media are beholden to the truth, PRC media are beholden to the Chinese Communist Party,” Ortagus said.  The China Daily publication has been distributed free of charge to Hill offices of senators and representatives since 1983. In recent issues, multiple [stories](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202006/05/WS5ed981cda310a8b24115afa7.html) have appeared that unfavorably compare U.S. riots in the wake of George Floyd’s May 25 killing by a Minneapolis police officer to China’s brutal takeover of Hong Kong contrary to the “one country, two systems” agreement it signed with the United Kingdom in 1997.  Beijing has spent millions of dollars through the China Daily in recent years on advertising sections made to look like genuine news content and inserted into The New York Times, Washington Post, and other major U.S. newspapers.  Banks has been campaigning to remove the China Daily for months. Earlier this year, he [told](https://www.theepochtimes.com/indiana-representative-plans-push-to-stop-china-daily-distribution-to-members-of-congress_3192168.html) The Epoch Times that “what people don’t know is that every morning, we receive a packet of journals and newspapers, and, while that is very helpful to me as a policymaker, the China Daily being included on an almost-daily basis in that packet is a dangerous precedent.”  “Not just because it’s a propaganda rag, but because of who owns it and how it’s paid for, and for that to show up on the doorstep of every member of Congress, to be distributed to every member of Congress’s team, and oftentimes to be lying around for constituents visiting offices to read, which is what most of these newspapers end up doing, is almost an endorsement of them as a legitimate news source, which they are not.”  In a Sept. 30, 2019, letter to Phil Kieko, the chief administrative officer (CAO) of the House of Representatives, Banks said China Daily and the four-to-eight page inserts in U.S. publications “serve as cover for China’s atrocities, including its genocide of Uyghurs in the Xinjiang region and its support for the crackdown in Hong Kong.”  Kieko, a former longtime aide to Rep. James Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.) before becoming the House CAO, declined to act in response to Banks’s letter, claiming to have no jurisdiction over the distribution of news products to House offices.  *Contact Mark Tapscott at Mark.Tapscott@epochtimes.nyc*  ### Did you know that we’re independent?

The George Floyd Tragedy and Ballot Access News 6-15-20
I'm working on an idea where police are considered armed forces, and since I have the right to refuse to house and home to armed forces under the Bill of Rights then undercover cops are breaking the law by not announcing themselves as armed forces upon the entering of a premisis. So, basically it would make it such that undercover police can walk around on the streets, but may not infiltrate into a home, house, or family.

Don Blankenship: Coal, Death, Unions, Prison, Obama, & "Cocaine Mitch".
Official 2020 U.S Constitution Party Presidential Candidate Announcement Via Facebook    The Constitution Party Announces Its Presidential Ticket!  During the Constitution Party's telephonic National Convention held May 2, 2020, Don Blankenship of West Virginia received the nomination as the party presidential candidate. Blankenship was one of five candidates seeking the nomination. Don is a member of the West Virginia State Party. More information below.  William (Bill) Mohr was chosen as the Vice-Presidential candidate. He is the State Chairman of the Michigan U.S. Taxpayers Party, the state affiliate of the Constitution Party. Under Mohr's leadership, the party has thrived and consistently grown. More information below.  Don Blankenship's Remarkable Story  Don Blankenship was born on March 14, 1950, in "Coal Country"-in a town with 200 residents called Stopover, Kentucky. His first home was a camper that cost $750. It had no indoor plumbing and sat alongside the mainline of the then Norfolk and Western railroad track.  Forty years later, Don became President of the largest and the most successful coal company that ever operated in "Coal County." In that role, he oversaw the mining of more coal than anyone in the region's history — enough coal to fill a train of railroad cars that would encircle the world three times.  In 2009, when Barrack Obama took office, he started what came to be known as the "war on coal." President Obama named a former lifetime employee of the United Mine Workers to head the United States Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA). MSHA subsequently required one of the hundred mines under Blankenship's management to make changes that cut the mines' airflow in half. Just a day after the airflow reduction changes were completed, the mine exploded — killing twenty-nine miners.  President Obama declared just hours after the last perished miner's body was removed from the mine that "we do know that the tragedy was first and foremost the responsibility of management." MSHA further declared, "the operator blew up the mine." Both of these statements were made before the opening of an investigation.  Four years later, Don Blankenship personally funded a documentary that revealed to the public that MSHA had ordered the mine's airflow be reduced to half, resulting in the explosion. Senator Joe Manchin issued a press release demanding that Don be indicted and saying that he believed "Don has blood on his hands."  A few weeks later, Don was indicted by a federal grand jury. But Don was not indicted for having caused the explosion. Instead, he was indicted for allegedly lying to the public and for "conspiring to commit mine safety violations."  Don's criminal trial was held in West Virginia, not far from where the deadly mine explosion occurred. The trial Judge was an Obama appointee, and the prosecutor was the son of one of the five federal judges seated in the same federal courthouse. Before the trial, U.S. Senator Jay Rockefeller (who had sponsored the judge's confirmation by the U.S. Senate) released a statement saying essentially that a fair trial was more than Don deserved.  Despite the public emotions, biased media reporting, two U.S. Senators having signaled their views that Don was guilty, the trial being held with the perished miners families in attendance, the prosecutor was the son of a federal judge, an Obama judge presiding over the trial and far worse, the jury found Don not guilty of all the felony charges against him.  Creating even more concerns, was the fact that before the verdict, the judge was told by the jury foreman multiple times that they were deadlocked, and yet she ordered them to continue deliberating anyway. After three weeks of deliberation, the jury found Blankenship guilty of the misdemeanor charge, and not guilty of the felony charges.  Blankenship's attorneys were confident that he would be granted a sentence of probation. However, the federal judge sentenced Don to 10 months in a federal prison that housed 2,400 felons and one misdemeanor prisoner – Don Blankenship.  Don spent ten months in that prison and was released to a halfway house for another year. His misdemeanor conviction was costly — limited freedom for three years, $250,000 in fines, along with devasting damage to his reputation and character.  Even though Don was only convicted of a misdemeanor and had already served his maximum prison time, he has continued to fight his conviction. In the process of his appeal battle, Don and his attorneys uncovered evidence that the government had destroyed documents, withheld evidence, lied to the judge, and threatened witnesses.  Finally, after five years, a federal judge recommended that Don's conviction be voided and that it be entirely removed from the record, due to "prosecution misconduct." But the Obama appointed judge has not acted to void the conviction.  During this same period, Don ran for the United States Senate as a Republican from West Virginia. Throughout the campaign, Don was subject to the rules of a halfway house in Las Vegas, which confined his campaign efforts at times. No one gave Don any chance of winning the Senate seat while serving time in a Las Vegas halfway house.  Fox News was so intrigued by Don's campaign and situation that they decided to have a nationally televised debate between Don and his two career politician opponents. Don entered the debate with a Fox poll and other polls showing that he was eight points behind. The day after the debate, polls showed Don to be up by as much as eighteen points.  In the seven days leading up to the election, Fox News, CNN, MSNBC, and other media outlets, as well as Republican political operatives like Karl Rove, told their audiences that Don was a felon, a convicted felon, a moron, a racist, an imbecile, a person responsible for the deaths of twenty-nine miners and more.  Don lost the election. He has filed a defamation lawsuit against dozens of media outlets, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, and Donald Trump Jr.. His lawsuit is pending in the same federal courthouse, where he was falsely convicted of a misdemeanor.  Don has written two books. This first book provides evidence that the government was responsible for the coal mine explosion. The second book, to be published sometime late this year or early next, will expose how United States Senators conspired to stop him from winning a United States Senate seat.  "I am running for President of the United States as a Constitution Party member in the hope of opening Americans' eyes. It is time for Americans to vote for America and not for a Republican or a Democrat. Elections must be about helping America win not about helping a politician win." Don Blankenship  [https://www.donblankenship.com/](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.donblankenship.com%2F&h=AT31A1GaSvtkv_L2LolNYcefJF_OGoTR0QqswpHORoAPbdQmAAJR_cyJtJiSfAZYS7xyXAKDcfaDzkDFvbOfoRYGgdGFIcyyykU267QAohyQxVksb1J11f5HskabfHSMlxXDFgEA1lywllm0LBykP6a9kHChYea2Av-LFJY2sn_k-DCJEN8InLV8QzGLdJ-ux5FnhjP6FOcVUEY7rMw0bjFXXNXw6zE9hx5ryilyPynw4irV4N6jiUPQMyKiA7bUFPqGI7yZ0V2P_4mcJve__b8soDa-4pwJixM7hoPJMX_iw0enBiARw1FE0DOX-Cd5YY5QfSmFS9z8VgmUVPl9o9Lb0xlY8L2Mw56ISJm6G66e1wZ8eIYEPgN8xLVeDEXzTeHMKaqxs7aU5JQ7wKePSA72AqSAkmPaxrWRqJCcudlNsdOg1IyN0fRiEYIrlHhll4SbfcKZznjQRV4lbD9IoxOuUlgFk68BXlIUnq_KAs2Gs92FXWYfiQoDQYaohspRiT9Wr-Guof59Cp_tA6NiW8Jv0czyMdPViKdC2uMCvHf9Uz6Lsa31YJk23peHuWBKrgYSE-ptJPFYMPsNml5knHjqZn0A6962J419zVhAbhKisUIZarKnsyorLR1TURsO_QKApzljbkGA-YMA_mX1)  William Mohr Background:  William (Bill) Mohr was born in 1959 and raised in Byron Center, Michigan. He was one of six children, three sisters, and two brothers. He is married to Cheryl and is a father to six children, four stepchildren, and 18 grandchildren.  Bill has worked at several jobs over the years, including over-the-road truck driving and managing a food production plant. For the recent ten years, Bill has been self- employed in the housing industry.  Bill spent six years as a Precinct Delegate with the Republican Party but switched his affiliation to the Constitution Party in 2005. For eight of the last ten years, he has chaired the State Central Committee of the U.S. Taxpayers Party of Michigan (Michigan's affiliate of the Constitution Party), and the party has experienced substantial and consistent growth under his leadership.  William Mohr's Campaign Statement  These are very uncertain times in our nation.  The American people have been perplexed with very poor governance; unconstitutional law, regulation and actions by every level of government. They have found themselves powerless to get it corrected. Tea Parties have come and gone, leaving few fragmented groups around the country. Political action organizations abound, but don't seem to be able to get the foothold needed to make the changes necessary.  The answer to good governance simply lies in solely in the election of good candidates. It is not a team sport. I plead with my peers, the American people, to leave the party politics in the past and vote for worthy candidates; candidates who understand the obligation they have to legislate within the confines of the Constitution.  Don Blankenship and William Mohr offer Americans a choice to restore good government. They will take their oath of office seriously and fully expect the American people to hold them accountable to it.
Don Blankenship and William Mohr will be the party’s 2020 POTUS nominee.

Where can we expect the party to be on the ballot in 2020? I know Louisiana is super easy to be on the ballot, as is Vermont, Kentucky, Rhode Island, Maine, and New Hampshire (a lot of these states are states that the party has not been on in awhile). In Kentucky, people can still register as a Constitution Party voter. There is also Minnesota, Alaska, and North Dakota all of which are rather easy as well.

What Will The Constitution Party Do Different? Now is the time that we, as a society, need to seriously discuss reproductive controls. It is pure folly to think that the unskilled labor that will be replaced by automation will all somehow go on to do other work that is both productive to society and self-supporting. We are about to end up with an unemployment problem like we have never seen and the time to do something about it is now, before it becomes a problem.  Step 0: Free, government provided permanent and semi-permanent (IUD, implant, etc) birth control for anyone who wants it. Programs to encourage young people to get it done. We should be doing this anyway.  Step 1: Receiving government benefits due to lack of income? Fine, but you can't vote while you are drawing those benefits or for 2 years afterwards. Voting should be reserved for members of society that produce value.  Step 2: Drawing benefits because you can't afford to care for your child? Mandatory IUD for the mom, and semi-permanent BC for the dad. Have another kid afterwards and still need support? Get those tubes tied first.  At some point, once the population starts to shrink, we will have to close off immigration to all but the most qualified people, as we will have plenty of people freed up from tedium to devote themselves to more productive work.  I'd take it a step up and say you have to have a permit to be able to have a child, but I know that is drastic. However I definitely think we should have a population freeze and even give tax returns for every year a person of age doesn't have a child up to like 40 or something.

Another State on the Verge of Ballot Qualification 6-18-18
News Update:June 11th 2018 A Report By Joe Miller *The following report on Constitution Party ballot access was recently published by our friend Joe Miller. We hope you will take his advice and support this effort.*  The Constitution Party [has continued to make significant gains in ballot access efforts over the past several weeks](https://constitutionparty.nationbuilder.com/r?u=http%3A%2F%2Fjoemiller.us%2F2018%2F05%2Fconstitution-party-scores-incredible-victory-north-carolina-focused-wisconsin-next%2F&e=d80266c41423adede419e55b56715243&utm_source=constitutionparty&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=joe_miller_6_11_18&n=1). On June 6, the North Carolina Board of Elections voted unanimously to certify the Party’s ballot status. This marks the first time the Constitution Party will be on the ballot in that state.  Big gains are also being made in West Virginia. Ex-Republican Don Blankenship – who attacked RINO Senator McConnell as “Cocaine Mitch” during the recent West Virginia primary – is now seeking election to the U S Senate seat under the Constitution Party banner. Supporters there are aggressively moving forward to get the required signatures for Mr. Blankenship to be on the ballot. Their deadline is August 1.  Additionally, the Constitution Party has now qualified two statewide candidates in Wisconsin to be on the ballot in November. As the Constitution Party candidates will be facing off against only Democrats and Republicans, it is almost certain that they will receive enough votes for Wisconsin to have ballot access in 2020.  The Constitution Party is now on target to have ballot access in 20 states by year end. New Mexico is the Constitution Party’s next apparent target. To qualify there, New Mexico activists reportedly must get a minimum of 500 more signatures by June 28. However, given the Constitution Party’s problem with corruption in the qualification processes nationwide, the Party – according to National Chairman Frank Fluckiger – would like a margin of at least 1500 signatures. That means another 2000 signatures are needed there within the next three weeks.  Chairman Fluckiger encourages any New Mexicans sick of the two-party controlled system to assist in gathering signatures. To help out, he suggests you call JW Fakes at 505-435-4635 or Kent Miller at 520-820-8393; or visit [www.constitutionparty.com](https://constitutionparty.nationbuilder.com/r?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.constitutionparty.com%2F&e=d80266c41423adede419e55b56715243&utm_source=constitutionparty&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=joe_miller_6_11_18&n=2) for more information and, of course, donate to the Party’s ballot access efforts while you’re there.

On the Verge of Success In Wisconsin
Collapse of constitutional government of USA Collapse Of Constitutional Government Of The United States Of America; The Responsibility For The Collapse Of The Constitutional ; Government of The United States of America     The present task is to identify agencies and *individuals of the USA government who are responsible for the collapse of the constitutional democracy and the simultaneous formation of the current totalitarian state here.   As may be expected the criminals and the terrorists of the two premier homicidal groups (i.e.: the fbi/cia) are also the spearheads of the nation's global intel operations, both overt and covert.** Other intel groups take orders (either directly or indirectly ) from the fbi and the cia.   Due to the corruption, incompetence and outright felonious mindset of the members of the fbi/cia, all of the other intel arms of the USA government are unable to protect the country from the mounting threats by persons and countries who seek to stop this nation's assault on Humanity. The reason for the national intel failure, therefore , can be directly attributable to the fbi/cia and their foolish congressional and presidential Handlers. See my "URGENT MESSAGE TO THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS:  As a result of this website and (Geral W. Sosbee vs. fbi, Whistle Blower, ex-FBI Agent of the United States of America) I have learned that the following intel groups study my material sometime in an apparent effort to comprehend why the fbi would attempt to frame (or neutralize) one of their own: ** fbi- this group of thugs ostensibly operates under doj, but in reality the fbi is the boss; cia- this group of assassins is a nation unto itself, operating completely independently of the US governmnet; * homeland security (responsible for many threats and assaults on my person)has an intel office manned by special agents and others who analyze data; * dea has an intel office for national security matters, but dea is largely controlled by fbi/cia; dea also pretends to function under the authority of doj; * the dept of defense is top dog in military intel, but they too take orders (or to put it mildly, "requests" from the fbi/cia)-within this dod group are army, air force, navy, marines (their respective intel offices);also under the dod banner are the dia, nsa, nro (national recon office), and the national geospacial intel office (Note that this office has extensively analysed my sites and for this reason I came to learn of their existence as a highly specialized tech office coordinating data both from earth and space); * the us department of state has its own office of intel which regularly reviews my material to determine whether I may be a candidate for a federal arrest warrant;The US depts of energy and treasury also each visit my sites in connection with their appraisals of finances, etc., in connection with my material and visits thereto; * The various intel groups have their own subgroups which also carry out mission oriented objectives globally. For purposes of this report the reader should understand that the United States of America is run by the intel services and that these agencies are so completely corrupt in their operations and influence that no one can touch them. * The names of fbi and cia agents, operatives, thugs, assassins, etc., is a work in progress; see my sites, newspaper reports, and perform other inquiries to identify the government rat bastards who look to imprison, torture, kill anyone who stands in their path.  **[Some of the above material is borrowed from the book, "Intelligence and National Security, A Reference Handbook" by J.

Blankenship accepts W.Va. Constitution Party nomination to run for U.S. Senate
Incredible Victory in North Carolina! We Now Move to Wisconsin. June 1st Deadline.  This is a message from the national chairman:  We received great news this week! The Constitution Party effort to gain ballot access in North Carolina exceeded the required number of registered voter signatures to qualify for ballot access in 2018 and 2020. News of our success was picked up by U.S. News and World Report, a major newspaper in Raleigh, North Carolina, and other papers in that state. In addition, a popular radio talk show host interviewed our North Carolina state chairman, Al Pisano. The interview was deemed a tremendous success and was well received by the listening audience.  Obtaining ballot access in Hawaii, and now North Carolina has brought more favorable publicity to the national party than any other activity that we have undertaken, especially in an off\-year election. It conveys to the public that we are not only serious about building a viable political party but also successful in doing so. Being recognized for our success in North Carolina by U.S, News and World Report is something I would never have thought possible.  What the North Carolina party leadership and their group of volunteers accomplished is nothing short of amazing. In all, they turned into the county clerks a total of over 16,300 signatures. Of that number, 15,938 have been processed thus far and 12,537 have been determined as valid. The validity rate was 78.6&#37; which is most remarkable. That number gives us a cushion of over 600 signatures over the 11,925 valid signatures that are required. All of this was accomplished since mid\-December which is a very short time frame.  This is the first time ever that the Constitution Party has qualified for ballot access in that state. Our sincere thanks go out to our state party leaders, Al Pisano and Kevin Hayes, for their incredible leadership in this undertaking. In addition, our sincere thanks are extended to Nicholas Sumbles, our sole paid petitioner who collected 10,000 signatures, and to the numerous volunteers who collected the remaining 6,000 plus signatures. When we first undertook this effort, no one really expected us to accomplish what was considered unattainable, especially in such a short period of time.  Last but not least, our sincere thanks go out to our many supporters who donated month after month to the ballot access effort. Without your steady flow of monthly donations, we could never have accomplished what we did. Your faithful donations made it possible to keep Nicholas out in the field gathering signatures week after week. Know that your financial support is deeply appreciated. Give yourselves a good pat on the back!  Success in North Carolina has now made it possible for us to focus on yet another state and that state is Wisconsin. As many of you know, we already have ballot access in that state. However, in order to maintain ballot access for 2020, we need to run at least one statewide candidate this year and that candidate needs to garner at least one percent of the vote cast for that office. That is very doable and Wisconsin hopes to field two such statewide candidates this year. In order to do that we have one serious hurdle that we must overcome. **The state requires that to run for any statewide office, a candidate must collect the signatures of 2,000 Wisconsin residents that are at least 18 years old. They do not need to be registered voters, but simply Wisconsin residents.**  Andrew Zuelke is gathering signatures to get on the ballot for State Treasurer and Terry Larson is seeking to be on the ballot for Attorney General. They and party members have been gathering signatures. Andrew has collected over 500 signatures and Terry has gathered 367. Volunteers continue to gather more, but I have been so preoccupied with gaining ballot access in North Carolina that I have not been able to follow up on the signature gathering effort in Wisconsin as I would have liked to.  This is where we again ask for your help. We have just two weeks left before the June 1st deadline to turn in the signatures. I am therefore asking that if you live in Wisconsin, or have like\-minded family or friends in that state, you contact Andrew Zuelke at constitutionpartyofwisconsin@gmail.com or call him at 920\-748\-7296. He can provide a petition for you to sign or direct you to someone who can get your signature. **Time is of the essence; we need your help if we are to succeed.**  Failure to get the required number of signatures to get them on the ballot will result in the party losing ballot access for 2020. If ballot access is lost, the party will need to gather 10,000 signatures to regain ballot access in 2020. Therefore, it is simply critical that we secure the balance of needed signatures to put both men on the ballot this year. **Please act immediately as time is of the essence.**  If you are able to support the ballot access effort financially, please do so by going to our website and using the [Ballot Access](https://constitutionparty.nationbuilder.com/ballot_access?e=d80266c41423adede419e55b56715243&utm_source=constitutionparty&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=2018_5_21_nc_wi_ballot&n=1) donation option, or you may donate by check using this [printable form](https://constitutionparty.nationbuilder.com/r?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.constitutionparty.com%2Fassets%2FHPLS-Constitution-Party-Victory-Fund.pdf&e=d80266c41423adede419e55b56715243&utm_source=constitutionparty&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=2018_5_21_nc_wi_ballot&n=2). Every donation of $5.00, $10,00, $15.00, $20.00, $25.00, $50.00, $100.00 or more is deeply appreciated. Each dollar donated this year goes much further as the closer we get to 2020, the cost of getting each signature goes up.   For God Family and Country,    Frank Fluchiger   National Chairman   Constitution Party  [www.constitutionparty.com](https://constitutionparty.nationbuilder.com/r?u=http%3A%2F%2Fconstitutionparty.com%2F&e=d80266c41423adede419e55b56715243&utm_source=constitutionparty&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=2018_5_21_nc_wi_ballot&n=3)

Message From Frank Fluckiger CP National Chairman From Facebook:  Dear Fellow Patriots: I want to address with you a concern that has been weighing on my mind since the November General Election As you now all know this was an election in which our delegates selected a candidate who came from within the ranks of the party. As a result the party did not have the luxury to draw on funds that came into the campaign in the past with the selection of an outside party candidate. This meant we were required to depend upon our own efforts to raise funds to gain ballot access and to promote our candidates. Had we been on the ballot in more states, they would have received many thousands of more votes. The Castles and other loyal party members worked tirelessly to generate the badly needed funds to gain ballot access and to promote our candidates. Few realize the hours that were spent to accomplish what they did. In all The Castle campaign raised less than $100,000.00 for this effort and the party was able to raise an additional $19,370.00 strictly for ballot access. Yet in spite of the limited funds that we raised, and getting on the ballot in two less states than in 2012, the number of votes polled by the Castle/Bradley team was a record 203,026 votes and that does not include states such as VA, AL, OR, NH and NE that did not tally any of the votes written in for our candidates. This is a remarkable feat to say the least and speaks volumes for those who gave their all to achieve that level of success. After the election we retained ballot access in the same number of states (12) as we did after the 2012 election. Those states are FL, SC, MS, MO, SD, WI, MI, ID, WY, NV, CO, and UT. The bottom line is that in order to build a viable party we must 1) Get on the ballot in many more states than we have in the past and 2) Run as many local candidates in local non partisan elections in the next four years as we possibly can. Yes, this will be a tremendous challenge, but it is the only way we are going to build a viable political party. Increasing our readership of the Howard Philips Legacy Society Newsletter can be a key to achieving these goals. This is a newsletter that all of our national, state and local county leaders should be subscribing to. In fact all of our members should be getting it. The monthly donations range from $7.00, $12.00, $20.00, $30.00, $50.00 and $75.00 with variouspremiums given out at each level. I have attached the application for you to review. Currently we have just under 90 people who are either currently subscribing or who had subscribed during the past year. If just 20 party members in each of the 38 states where we have active leadership subscribed to the newsletter each month at the lowest premium level of $7.00 that would provide a steady monthly income of $5,320.00. If they selected to subscribe at the $12.00 level that would bring in $9,120.00 That would provide us with a viable source of income that we could begin our ballot access efforts immediately in a number of states. We already have work progressing in Alabama, Indiana, Hawaii, Virginia, Louisiana and Maryland. Fellow patriots, this is doable, but it is going to require the support of each of our state and national leaders. Each state officer, every national committee member and all of our executive committee members ought to be subscribing to the newsletter. Then too, there are hundreds of new people brought into the party through the Castle campaign that need to be contacted and given a personal invitation by you to subscribe. Current leaders in this effort are Wisconsin, Texas, Pennsylvania, Colorado and New York. I am asking that each of you National, state and local leaders sign up for the newsletter today and that you in turn ask your fellow state and county officers to do so as well as each of your national committee members.

Then if we increased that number again by 12 the General Election of 2018 we would be ballot qualified in 36 states!

New National Party News December 23rd From Constitution Party national Facebook page:   Frank Fluckiger, National Chairman of the Constitution Party, recently announced the appointment of Gary Welch to the position of National Communications Director, Clint Bishop to be the Chair of the Media and Organizational Committee, and Carolyn Cosby has volunteered to serve as the National Ballot Access Coordinator. Gary Welch will replace Karen Murray, who has resigned to serve in other roles within the party.

Inspiring Message From The Constitution Party of Ohio Facebook Page I'm late in getting this out but after all the post election late night entertainment, I was out of commission yesterday. Anything was up for grabs Tuesday night and I am proud to have stood by my values of LESS government, Constitutional Governance and shrinking the debt all while standing up for a man who is a great example of how a Candidate SHOULD be representing and reflecting the Country's values and his faith. Thank YOU Darrell Castle and Scott Bradley for giving US a chance to be heard at the ballot Tuesday night. I proudly wrote you in on my Ohio Ballot!  Now let's get to work in our local governments, start building up the Constitution party name and start the 100 year March back to Fundamental Restoration of our Constitutional Republic.  And just remember...YOUR 3rd party vote is NOT a vote for anyone else other than WHO you are voting for. Stand tall Constitutional Conservatives... we have a lot of work to do but we are were heard by many who had NEVER heard of our party before.

Congressional Bank Robbery: Republicans cave on everything and leave town-Remember If There's a Constitution Party Candidate On Your Ballot Vote For Them
Gary Johnson fan checking in. (x-post /r/castleforpresident) Hey guys, just wanting to let you know that if GJ wasn't running, Castle would probably have my vote. But there's two main issues preventing me from going with him:  1.) Castle literally has no way to win. He's not on enough state ballots. Gary is on all 50 state ballots and is the premier anti-Trump and anti-Clinton candidate. I don't believe in the lesser of two evils argument, but not being on enough ballots to conceivably win is where I draw my line. So for 2020, you guys need to ratchet up your ballot access drives a la what the LP has done this cycle.  2.) Castle is too hardcore on the social issues. It's why candidates like Rick Santorum and Ted Cruz never made it past the primaries. I'm a Christian libertarian, so I'm more socially conservative than most libertarians but much more socially liberal than most conservatives (if that makes sense). Nobody in this election cycle is caring much about the issues Castle is hammering hard. He needs to be going after the issues voters care about this time - namely, the economy and security. I'm not saying to change your beliefs, but just change your emphasis.  Good luck in 2016, and maybe better luck next time in 2020 CP. I'm a libertarian-leaning independent who's willing to look at all my options. So in 2020 I may be going with you guys over the LP depending on if you don't nominate a nut job ;)

August Tenth Deadline to Gather Signatures to Get Darrell Castle on the Ballot in Ohio Message from Ohio CP State Chairman  All, I just received a call from Frank Fluckiger, the National Constitution Party Chairman. The Castle campaign in conjunction with the National Party is committed to getting Castle – Bradley on the ballot in Ohio as Independent candidates for President and Vice President. As such, they will be providing additional resources from outside Ohio to ensure that we get the needed 7500 signatures filed by the August 10 deadline.  If you would like to help ensure they are on the ballot, you can do the following:   *  Continue to gather signatures and mail them to the CP of Ohio PO Box (PO Box 5, Eaton, OH 45320) to ensure that I have them by August 9 to deliver to the Statehouse. The forms can be downloaded / printed from the CP of Ohio website: http://www.cpofohio.org/help-castlepetitions.html In addition, the website contains detailed instructions on how the forms must be filled out and completed to be valid. Please be sure you follow them completely.  * Donate to Ballot Access on the national website – www.constitutionparty.com. Even if you do not have a lot of time to devote to gathering signatures, hopefully you can help give voters a choice in the upcoming election by giving to the Ballot Access on the national website to help National provide for the outside signature gatherers. Please do that now as National needs to know how much they can count on the CP members and others from Ohio to help fund ballot access in Ohio.  *   Provide housing if you are able for the signature gatherers being provided by National. This will reduce the ballot access cost that will be incurred if they must stay in hotels. It would be particularly helpful if you live near a large city / population center as that is going to be the most efficient place for them to maximize their signature gathering efforts.    *  Encourage others to help. Email your friends and family to be sure and sign a petition or even work to gather signatures on their own. If nothing else, a husband and wife and / or close family can sign petitions within the family and mail them in. JUST REMEMBER, that a person CANNOT SIGN his own petition. However, a husband and wife can print two petitions and each witness the other’s signature on separate petitions. Just follow the detailed instructions on the website and mail the signed petitions with the bottom of the page properly filled out to the P.O. Box. Even if there are two sheets with only one signature on each page, it counts. Of course, I would rather have sheets with multiple signatures but I will take what you give me. Encourage others to do the same.  *   Pray! Pray to God for guidance, wisdom, and mercy in these perilous times.   *  Please let me know what you are able to do, or plan to do so that I can inform National such that they know how much help to provide. Don Shrader, Chairman 330-400-3444 "Always vote for principle, though you may vote alone, and you may cherish the sweetest reflection that your vote is never lost." ~John Quincy Adams~  [Link to petition page.](http://www.cpofohio.org/help-castlepetitions.html)

Question from an interested person looking to join the party. Hi there! So, this is a legit question, because I'm really interested in signing up to this political party and maybe even in the future run for office in my community under its principals. One thing I am questioning is the stance on same sex marriage. Can someone please give me a little insight into the view of the party on the LGBT community. My family is directly linked to the the LGBT community. I feel strongly about equality for all Americans regardless of sexuality and I really am finding myself connecting deeply with the party as a whole.  I suppose my question is centered on ammendment XIV section 1 "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside. No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." How can the C.P. (is this a used abbreviation btw) not support same sex marriage and still be able to hold true to the constiturion? Is it simply a definition issue? I sincerely am interested, I have been searching for this party for a long time it seems and this is the only issue I find myself questioning. Thank you my future brothers and sisters!!

Please Donate and Volunteer for Ballot Access-Urgent Deadlines Ahead The Party needs your help to get  ballot access in key states.Here is a message from our national party chairman-   Dear Fellow Constitution Party Supporter:  Exciting news from Pennsylvania this week!  The party is one step closer to a major ballot access victory in Pennsylvania.  A state court judge has issued an order giving the legislative body one week to act on a pending ballot access bill, reducing the required number of signatures from 21,775 to 5,000 signatures.  If the legislators fail to act the judge will act for them.  Either action will place the party in favorable position to gain ballot access and claim another 20 electoral votes!  Virginia and Ohio are also key sates where ballot access can also be achieved with 5,000 signatures!  Ohio, Virginia, and Pennsylvania have a combined total of 51 electoral votes.  Achieving ballot access in these three states would virtually ensure that the party would be on the ballot in enough states to exceed the 270 electoral vote threshold to win the presidency.  To achieve this goal, your financial investment in the party is critical and is needed immediately.  **We do not have a single day to spare as ballot access petitions are time-sensitive.**    The ballot petition deadline in **Pennsylvania is August 1st**; in **Ohio, it is August 10th**; and in **Virginia, it is August 26th**.  At this point **we need as many volunteers as possible** and we will also need to bring in professional signature gatherers.  The expected cost for professionals to assist our efforts will run as high as $2.50 per signature, which translates into a total cost of $56,250.00.  **I cannot emphasize enough the urgency and necessity of your most generous gift to our ballot access drive.**  [Your donation](https://secure.giftwrapplus.org/cpnc/eu/contribute/ballot-access.aspx)  of $5.00, $10.00, $25.00, $50.00, $100.00, $500.00 or more is critically needed.  As in my previous pleas to you, I encourage you to forward this message on to your family members and friends of like mind, and encourage them to go to the national website and to learn of the party –  [www.constitutionparty.com](http://www.constitutionparty.com/) .  You have been doing an incredible job.  As a result of your efforts and dedication, 47% of the donations received during the first half of June were from first time donors.  Folks, that is an impressive number, and I can not thank you enough.  This new support is keeping us in the game. Please continue that effort with this email.  Spread this message to your friends on Facebook, Twitter, and any other means available to you.  In addition to the above states, we are currently gathering signatures in Iowa, North Dakota, Alabama, Nebraska, Georgia, and Washington.  Please understand that the Constitution Party – your party- desperately needs your continued support.  [Your gift](https://secure.giftwrapplus.org/cpnc/eu/contribute/ballot-access.aspx)  of $10.00, $25,.00, $50.00, $100.00, $500.00 or more is needed now.  Your investment toward this effort is critical.  Make your contribution payable to the Constitution Party and mail it, [along with this form](http://www.constitutionparty.com/assets/2016_donationform_download_master.pdf) , to:  Constitution Party National Committee PO Box 1782 Lancaster, Pennsylvania 17608  or [donate online here](https://secure.giftwrapplus.org/cpnc/eu/contribute/ballot-access.aspx) .  Please act today. You can rest assured that each dollar will be wisely spent.  For God, Family, and Country,  Frank Fluckiger  National Chairman  Constitution Party    [Here is also a list](http://www.constitutionparty.com/get-involved/election-central/ballot-access/)  of who to contact to help with ballot access in every state that is currently collecting signatures.
