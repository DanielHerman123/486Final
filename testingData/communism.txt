'The Communist Necessity' and Combating Movementism in the Centres of Capitalism? I have been re-reading Joshua Moufawad-Paul's *The Communist Necessity* and found myself really eager to hear from other communists' experiences with their own country's version of movementism.   As for my own country (the Netherlands), 'socialism' is marred by confusion and appears eerily similar to JMP's descriptions of movementism. Revolutionary socialism is discredited as 'sectarian', 'unpragmatic', and 'antiquated', while tailism of popular movements is actively encouraged as a way to carve out a 'new' socialist movement — free from old 'totalitarian' habits of past revolutionaries. NATO's often upheld as an uncomfortable military 'necessity', and the European Union is equally often uncritically upheld as an inescapable part of the fabric of life. Interest in socialism predominantly seems to come from highly educated, culturally progressive younger folks, who often show no real interest and see little merit in the 'stuffy' revolutionary theories of the past. 'Doing' is seen as intrinsically good, whereas principled socialism is seen as sectarian, divisive, and fruitless.   The *New Left Review*, in describing the 'new left' of recent times more generally, inadvertently summed up the Dutch experience when they described these forces as:   >"*Respectful of NATO, anti-austerity, pro-public investment and (more guardedly) ownership, skeptical of 'free trade'; as a first approximation, we might call them small, weak social democracies.*"  I do believe that part of this reaction can be accredited to an intense fear of what a principled socialist struggle would entail (along with disorganization in the socialist movement); squared against an increasingly uncomfortable (but not yet totally impossible) existence under capitalism in such a country, principled socialism is just a tough sell.   JMP hints towards the fact that:  >"*Perhaps one answer is that those of us at the centres of capitalism are no longer the primary grave-diggers.*" (**p. 156**)  I say all this because JMP's suggestion is as follows:  >"*Historical necessity should teach us that the kernel of a militant organization, unified according to revolutionary theory, is the only thing capable of refounding a revolutionary movement.*" **(p. 129)**  How then, in such environments, is the importance of the 'communist necessity' brought to the fore by very small and often immediately discredited revolutionary forces in the centres of capitalism? What have communists in this subreddit attempted in order to raise the importance of the 'communist necessity' within their own countries? Any other opinions on this book and the trend of movementism in general are also more than welcome!
I hate my U.S. Foreign Policy class My foreign policy course, as you would guess, is the most pro-American, imperialist, capitalist course you could imagine. Mainly because my professor is basically a neoliberal/fascist and talks about how cool the military is and how NATO is cool and a bunch of historical events from a bourgeois perspective and are often times flat-out incorrect information.  There is absolutely no critical thinking in this class and as well as the entire political science department.  He also has us reading anti-communist books that, for example, call Stalin, Mao and even fucking Hugo Chavez "authoritarian dictators that use fear" blah blah.  He tries to come off as impartial but ends up being anti-communist and pro-U.S. hegemony.  And the people in class are even worse and don't know anything, but come off smugly with their "knowledge".   And we started watching a movie about the Soviet-Afghan War and it's also anti-communist (obviously), and he claims that very accurate information, which I doubt.  And if any of you have some recs on the Soviet-Afghan war please share!  This event is actually something I don't know much about, and Ik a lot of communists are split on it.  Ik this is a rant, but this is the only subreddit where I can say how I feel.

What is the solution to settler colonialism? I fully accept the premise that Israel, and older British imperial adventures like the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, are illegitimate settler-colonial projects. But I find that many comrades follow that point with rhetoric like “Land back to indigenous peoples!” or “Israel should not exist!” without discussing the practicalities of disestablishing existing settler-colonial states.  What is the Marxist view on where millions of Jews who have lived their whole lives in Israel should be forcibly moved? What about hundreds of millions of white people in North America and Oceania? If the answer is forced resettlement to Europe, doesn’t that start to sound ethno-nationalistic and reactionary? Also, what about Mizrahi Jews who were kicked out of their native Arab lands after Israel was created? What about the history of Ashkenazi Jews being persecuted and murdered by European states? Why would communists (who are supposed to be internationalists and antiracists) validate the genocidal, enslaving fiction of race and racial claims to land? If communists believe in “workers of the world unite,” then shouldn’t the goal be to establish rule of the working class across ethnic lines, without telling people where they can and cannot live?   I agree settler colonialism, including the ongoing settler projects in the West Bank and Golan Heights, is imperialist and should be condemned and resisted. But what do we do about decades- or centuries-old faits accomplis?  I am asking these questions in good faith and with an open mind, and would love to read any good sources addressing these issues.
Material Forces that Turn Socialism into Capitalism
LGBT members: do you feel capitalism is antithetical to sexual and gender equality? I personally feel like being a homosexual/bisexual/trans person and a capitalist is a contradiction. Under capitalism, there must always be a group or groups that are crushed underfoot. Capitalism is inherently exploitative and we are a relatively small and vulnerable group. Even if we gain equal rights, it won’t be enough under the current system, not to mention that our issues don’t start and end with only gender and sexuality; racial equality is also integral to our goals because a majority of LGBT people are not white. It’s like whack-a-mole, even if we somehow completely eradicate homophobia or transphobia, there are always other biases and phobias that will come into play that we will have to extinguish as a collective to ensure our safety. Also, even if we *are* granted equal rights, the whole point of capital is to create a cycle of hardship, progress, then collapse, and so on. If we depend on lawmakers, lobbyists, etc. to not care how it affects their bottom line, we are always at risk of losing them again. I want to see how others feel about this, or if I’m just making connections where there aren’t any.

What’s up with China and the Philippines? I’ve never looked into China and their military support to the Philippines against the CPP too deeply.  The more I look into it the worse it looks, but I find it hard to take the “social-imperialism” or “they’re just third world fascists” lines seriously. Certainly supporting the Philippines now that they themselves have even further cozied up to the US is not a good move, I’d love to be schooled and given reasons why I am wrong but I cannot quite understand China’s reasoning. Of course even in Mao’s days China has always made some very disagreeable foreign policy decisions,  and IMO has never played well with other communist countries.   If it is the fact that the CPP are considered terrorists worldwide then I could understand in the past 10 years having not supported them, though supporting their US puppet oppressors seems inexcusable. Today as the US continues to further push China into conflict, as the US further solidifies it control over the Philippines, I cannot quite see how their continued support for a US puppet can possibly bear anything positive, even if they were social imperialist as Maoists claim. I hope most of y’all can understand why even if China were half of what Maoists claim, that from the US they still appear worthy of support, just as the revisionist USSR was.

Book on Dialectical and Historical Materialism Hey folks, I'm compiling a reading list for a friend who's trying to learn about Marxism. I want to give them a good book on Dialectical and Historical Materialism, but I don't think they would be receptive to Stalin's book(for obvious reasons). Do you have any suggestions?
Learning mainstream economics/ technical vocab I'm looking for direction on how to learn more modern economics/ the technical vocabulary of economics as somebody with a high school diploma and no chance of going to school. Don't want to be swamped with neoliberalism in the process but I assume that comes with the territory. So essentially I'm just asking for recommendations on understanding the modern economy outside of the marxist lexicon if that makes sense.
1984 - Goldstein's Book, Chapter III Hi! I'm currently reading 1984 and I got to chapter III of the fictional manifesto of Goldstein in the book. I don't understand how chapter III is a jab at communism. I see the jab on hierarchal society, but how is this a jab on communism specifically, as it is said in Wikipedia (It is written that the book is a parody of Trotsky's book)  Hopefully, this explanation shall suffice, sorry if it sounds a bit weird.  P.S: Please don't spoil the rest of 1984
Central Committee of the TKP/ML calls for an election boycott – The Red Herald
Anti capitalist movements that weren't socialist/communist? Hey everyone, I'm starting the process of writing an essay/article/pamphlet(whatever it ends up being) about how anti capitalism is not an effective tool to dismantle capitalism and that you need a fleshed out ideology with an end goal in sight to get the work done.   My question is if there are any historical examples of a movement that is principally anti capitalist but ideologically devoid of any structure or system to replace it with.   Obviously, there are the "left wing" democrats like AOC and Bernie who are obviously grifters and have no real intention of dismantling capitalism, but I don't want the piece to be wholly American centric. My rough searches through Google bring up nothing other than articles about how the nazis either were or were not socialist and they are not what I am looking for.   Any and all info is appreciated, thank you for any time spent reading this and/or replying (:

The Pendleton 2: They Stood Up (Documentary) These two comrades have been political prisoners for the past 37 years. All for standing up and saving the life of their comrade Lincoln Love. They negotiated with the prison, and got assurances that conditions would improve. It was found that the guards were members of a white supremacist group the “Son’s of Light.” The jury trying the Pendleton Two was all white, and from the same areas as the racist guards. The Judge collaborated with the state against them and gave each of them what amounts to a life sentence. They then spent two and three decades in solitary confinement. Chris Trotter and John Cole have been refused a fair trial and have been left to serve life. Chris Trotter was to have his sentence vacated in 2018, but in 2019 a different judge resentenced him to 122 years.

Communist Party of India (Marxist): Brahmanical Fascism in a Red Cloak

My question might be stupid and it might come at the expense of me looking like I’m obsessed with ideology but I’m going to read this either way. I bought this book for other reasons.  Anyway the main reason I ask is on the back “money, gave us a purpose” which just seems absolutely false.

1932: Communist US Veterans surrounded the White House. US President evicts them with Tanks. July 28, 1932: Three years after the stock market crash, Tens of Thousands of United States Great War (WWI) veterans occupy and make financial demands of their Government in Washington D.C. The United States Senate refuses their demands. Motivated by two time Medal of Honor recipient, Marine Corps General Smedley Butler; Communist, United States Great War Veterans, surround the White House. Fearing a Communist Revolution, President Herbert Hoover then orders 6 ARMY Tanks, 200 Mounted Calvary with Sabers, and 400 Infantrymen with Fixed Bayonets and Tear Gas, under the command of MacArthur, Patton, and Eisenhower (WWII) to evict Thousands of United States Great War Veterans from Washington D.C. by burning down their encampments across the Anacostia river. Routed, Scattered, Humiliated, the Veterans lost the battle, but won the war. 100 days later the communist FDR wins 4 landslides: Social Security, Medicare, Veterans Benefits created.

Details of US involvement in military dictatorships in South America I think most people in our field eventually learn of the US involvement in implanting or supporting military dictatorships in South America in the 20th century (and even recently in some regards) but not necessarily know the details behind them, the historical context, how it was done, etc. At least this was certainly my case.     After looking it up I found these two interesting sources providing such contexts and details for the case of the Brazilian coup in 1964:   [https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB465/](https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB465/)   [https://consortiumnews.com/2018/06/04/distorting-the-life-of-bobby-kennedy/](https://consortiumnews.com/2018/06/04/distorting-the-life-of-bobby-kennedy/)     I was wondering if folks could provide comments like this for other similar scenarios in other countries.

Was the USSR ever under a Dictatorship of The Proletariat? I'm still learning, but I just saw a discussion in which I heard some good points against Stalin.   How could the USSR be a dictatorship of the proletariat, given Khrushchev was able to take power and completely change the direction of the party? How could a such a small number of individuals at the highest positions in the CPSU change the relations of production, yet still be under the control of the workers? What makes me agree even more in the claims of bureaucratization is the fact that, even with the majority of party members being workers, what mattered seemed to be what happened inside the Politburo, which only comprised of a couple of figures, all of whom were not workers. I make the same question in regards to China and Deng, how could the workers be in control if these changes (which most marxists-leninists condemn) were made without the support of the workers, especially after a cultural revolution?  I'd extend this same line of questioning for most other socialist experiments (such as Albania or Vietnam)

How to read government statistics? I lack expertise in Marxist theory and economics in general. However, in my Asian studies course (and as an Asian), I am due to look up some government statistics to evaluate some actual circumstances. I'm aware that liberal economics is fraud, but have been sidetracked by Sakai, MIM theory etc and planned to get to Marx after getting the materialist dialectics down. I should probably just read Capital but I'm not sure if I'd know how to apply it anyways...so here we are.  On a short note, should I begin with class analysis? From what I've read here I think compradors are middlemen (and reliant on) between transnational capital and has become the 'ruling' class itself (which literally owns my place), labor aristocracy is bought by capitalists along with exploitation of the Third World like managers (it needed to be evaluate internationally), petite bourgeoisie are small property holders both working and exploiting, proletariat is the coerced labor as commodity into exploitation for survival etc. I probably got things wrong but that was the idea.  What statistics should I look to find the actual proportions of sectors in the economy or where does the capital flows come from? I am already looking into employment and trying to understand government policy as a pointier to the bourgeoisie's priority. Unsurprisingly there is a lot of land and stock speculation here (finance center?) which goes into the GDP and I have no idea how it plays into the entire class structure or movement of capital.  Tourism industry is constantly emphasized by the government and multiculturalism is somehow used to harness global capital as I have read somewhere here. Is it that cultural imperialism and commodification plays a role somewhere in resolving capital's contradiction or there is (most likely) something omitted out of the picture?  So what advice would you give?  E: Any readings on the specifics of parasitic labor aristocracy, de-industrialization and dependence on migrant labor? How do I recognize fascism and external exploitation in economics? I think I'd probably have to do a brief historical materialist analysis, hopefully not too ambitious to a beginner. This is heading in too much directions.  More precisely, is there a focus or direction you would recommend for those beginning?

Confusion About the DPRK's Position in the Angolan Civil War I'm currently reading the book "Killing Hope" by William Blum. In the Zaire 1975-1978 chapter, the author says that Chinese and North Korean military advisers in Zaire were training forces on the same side as the US in the Angolan Civil War. However, when I look up information about the conflict online, it seems like North Korea supported the MPLA. What's going on here exactly? Is the information in the book true or not?

How did the KGB view the Islamic Regime of Iran? I know they supported the overthrow of the Shah, but I keep seeing different information whenever I try to find the KGB/Soviet’s opinions on the Islamic Regime. Some sources say they supported it solely for soviet interests and wanting to spread communism, and some others say they did not support it, because Islamic ideology directly opposed Soviet ideology, and a lot of the things the Islamic Regime did went against what the Soviets stood for. Another thing to note is the Soviets also seemed to support the much earlier democratic leader of Iran, Mohammad Mosaddegh, whose ideology also goes against the Islamic Regime’s. Lastly I wanted to note that the Islamic Regime executed Tudeh party members, which was the communist party of Iran. I don’t know, I’m getting mixed information, so I’m turning to reddit.

On the uprisings before the revolution. "The slaves revolted, rebelled, started civil wars, but they could never form a conscious majority, a party to lead their struggle, could not clearly grasp what they were aiming for, and even in the most revolutionary moments of history they were always a tool in the hands of the ruling classes."  In his book "On State", Lenin explains the difference between the earlier uprisings of rural workers and the Soviet Revolution. And, he attributes this difference to urbanization and the voting right of the bourgeois republic. However, even under these conditions, it is not fully stated why the workers come together for their common interests and undergo a mental transformation that will create the revolutionary force. What is the main reason for the mental transformation that will give the workers revolutionary power? Was it the Marxist literature that motivated them, was it the deep misery they lived in, or did the workers follow the revolution as unconscious herds?
Among Simple People – from the memoirs of Enver Hoxha on people's war against Germany
Cannabis in China vs DRPK So I’ll preface this with the fact that I’m a ML and I fully support China.   Despite this, I have a hard time understanding the source of China’s policy on cannabis. Especially in comparison to the lax policy on cannabis that the DRPK has.   I would honestly have no problem with their criminalizing of cannabis if they had the same policy towards alcohol. Is it just because they have used alcohol historically, and have not used cannabis?   Scientifically alcohol is far more harmful than cannabis, it is even more harmful than opioids, as far as the damage it does to organs. Despite this they have absolutely no regulations on alcohol (from what I can find.) I have a hard time believing the sources I can find on google, so if any of this is wrong I apologize.   From what I can see cannabis use is punished quite harshly. Is there any consciousness of the possible medicinal uses of cannabis in China, or consciousness of it’s relative safety in comparison to alcohol and tobacco? Is it due to social conservative culture, or is it viewed in the same “refer madness” kinda way that it was previously viewed in the US?   How did the DRPK and China end up with such opposite policies on cannabis?

Documentary List: Anti-Capitalist/Police, Black History, Pro-Labor, and more!     Hello all! Below is a list of documentaries that are anti-capitalist/police,      pro-labor, healthcare, black history, and so much more. I have been putting      together a collection for a discord I have started (you can message me on the      side if you want an invite, not sure it's ok to do in here) where I stream one      at least once a week.

Who benefits from the so-called sexual revolution? (1977)
Homi K. Bhabha’s foreword to “The Wretched of the Earth” and Cornell West’s intro… how did they come to be? Currently reading Franz Fanon and I was surprised to find the intro and foreword to be so out of place. The things they add are like adding a foreword to “Capital” that subtly tries to disprove and belittle Marx while also showering him with praise. The way Bhabha mentions Fanon’s last days in an attempt to make him look bad (what black revolutionary wouldn’t be suspicious of nurses in a country like the US in the early 60’s) and the way that West feels the need to not only mention that he finds some of Fanon’s formulations “objectionable” but he also compared Fanon to *Emma Goldman.* Emma Goldman, the Zionist, the Anarchist, who slandered Lenin while also supporting acts of terrorism… It just seems frankly offensive to add these as an intro and foreword, and seems to serve to undermine this revolutionary text. Do y’all think this was done intentionally..? I honestly do not know how to feel about West, and know little about Bhabha, but I know based on their words in front of me that they are at best misguided.  I can edit this with the full versions of my problems with their writing but I assume some of you are familiar with this version of “The Wretched of the Earth.”

Is Germany the only country communists pick Israels side in the Conflict of the Middle East? I, for one, am against imperialist and fascist regimes, as any communist should. Israel is very clearly the imperialist son following in big daddy USA's shoes. In Germany I have noticed, that some people, who call themselves communist, say that it's antisemitic to support Palestine and criticise the israeli government. I've never noticed other countries to have that kind of fake leftist movement gain such a hold of the masses as in germany. So, I'd like to ask if anyone's ever noticed this in their own countries, respectfully.

Interview on Imran Khan Arrest Attempts and Lahore High Court Rallies
Upcoming Cuban Elections and another potential astroturf attempt As many have probably heard by now, Cuba will be having it's Elections on March 26th. I look forward to participating but have come across some recent development within the Miami Cuban diaspora that seem to be alarming.  I started seeing a large uptick in recent hashtags under #yonovotoel26m. On the surface level it seems like a call for Cuban citizens to abstain from voting in order to prove the sham elections of the Communist government.  After some digging, I started getting some very creepy vibes of the exact same tactics used for the #N15 astroturf hashtag used in 2021. Let me lay down what I've found so far.  I first came across the hashtag yesterday night as I was looking through r/Cuba (which is notorious for being fully controlled by Miami based Cubans). I decided to plug the hashtag into Keyhole and found that the first use was by a twitter account called (TRIGGER WARNING AHEAD) [Asere Ya](https://twitter.com/AsereYaPing/status/1636458442532573185?t=_VIZwjyVFvGvUhZ_TkjIow&s=09), a vehemently anti cuban government account that makes some ridiculous post such as this one that started the hashtag by putting an image of a random (I'm assuming stillborn so **trigger warning to any before they click on the link**) fetus on the ground and claiming a student had given birth to it in school and proceeded to throw it out a second story window (that alone gives me vibes of those anti vaxxer far right style Facebook posts which lines up with the political atmosphere of Florida and Texas atm).  Now the first time this hashtag was posted by this account, it was posted with the following text;  >craneales. Se encontró en horas de la mañana siendo trasladado al hospital de VC, lo último que se supo fue que falleció.  Which translate to;  >cranial. He was found in the morning hours being transferred to the VC hospital, the last thing that was known was that he died.  This was posted at around 4PM EST yesterday [March 16th] and the story of the fetus originated from an account called [@DoctorPatria](https://twitter.com/DoctorPatria/status/1636382766593093641?t=gWf89tH7kaKExDGXcUMjoA&s=19) (a Houston, TX Cuban) earlier the same day around. From the same account comes "great" criticisms like saying drinking Moringa based juices is equivalent to feeding everyone in Cuba grass and more.  Now comes the part where I get mad #N15 vibes. As we saw in the #N15 hashtag, it quickly spread like wildfire with a ton of freshly made accounts all posting the hashtag with the exact same generic phrase.   Well after that Asere Ya account posted the first usage of the hashtag, just a few hours later (Around 7PM EST the same day) it was suddenly picked up by the Anti-Cuban Government account [@CubadiceNo](https://twitter.com/CubadiceNO/status/1636504668468568064?t=akgIZWsX9V84XAY_oMlrIA&s=19), also based in Miami. Now when it was first posted by them, they had changed the language and message from the first user of it, dropping the supposed newborn story out (obviously). Now it's message read this;  >A 10 días de la farsa electoral que la dictadura escenificará el 26 de marzo, 64 mil razones para NO votar. Que tu protesta sea tu ausencia a las urnas. Que tu voz sea la abstención. No te dejes coger para eso: No Votes el 26.  Which translates to;  >10 days after today the electoral farce that the dictatorship will stage on March 26, 64,000 reasons NOT to vote. May your protest be your absence at the polls. May your voice be abstention. Don't get caught for that: Don't Vote on 26.  As soon as this was tweeted and shared on Instagram, it was then picked up by a very popular Anti-Cuban Government activist in Miami named [Carolina Barrero](https://twitter.com/carolinabferrer/status/1636513174298976261?t=t_bAlXJa3NZs2HmdQgCgcQ&s=19) using the exact same text as above, verbatim. It was at this point that it started spreading incredibly quickly, with [dozens](https://ibb.co/XDpqQN6) of [accounts](https://ibb.co/Jsq5wyf) all posting the exact same hashtag, all with the exact same text.  She also had previously tweeted out two posts showing that she went to both the US State Dept., as well as the [EEAS](https://twitter.com/carolinabferrer/status/1636062270127046656?t=CEaZFT7dDEDYUc062kYlaA&s=19) , asking for them to speak out against the elections and to keep a close eye on them.  I will be gathering photos of all my evidence as well as links to everything as I research this further. If any other comrades here are good at hashtag tracking or investigative journalism, please work some magic on this issue to prevent another debacle like we had in 2021. For all other comrades, please try your best to dispel misinformation and call out this campaign for the far right imperialist tactics it is and help educate non Cubans about the issue. The best thing for this is to get ahead of it before it becomes an issue like last time.   Thank you for your time Comrades!  Edit: as of posting this, I can no longer find the tweet of Carolina Barrero consulting with the US State Dept. on her Twitter. Fret not, I always have [images](https://ibb.co/CKDDQ9j) to back it up. I'm not sure if they deleted it or if my Twitter is possibly acting up (forced to use mobile atm), but if it was deleted, that is quite suspicious.
J. Sakai: The Shape of Things to Come It's a newly released collection of Sakai interviews and writings. Most of it's republished material, but there's a new large interview, which I'll let Kersplebedeb describe:  > “The Shape of Things to Come” is an extensive (over 100 pages!) new interview with Sakai, conducted between 2020 and 2022, and presented here in two parts. A wide range of topics are addressed, including but not limited to the Trump presidency and the rise of the white far right; the class and national composition of the George Floyd Uprising and Black Lives Matter; the gender politics of both the CPUSA-era Old Left and the 60s New Left; the role of national, class, and gender contradictions in the movement against the Vietnam War; the legacy of anti-war organizing within the u.s. military; the left’s historical confusion regarding the white working class; warlordism in Mexico; why “globalization vs nationalism” is an inadequate way to think about our current situation; the breakdown of nations and capitalism’s “creative destruction”; the work of Immanuel Wallerstein, specifically in terms of the end of capitalism; the nature of the interregnum, and considerably much more...  I'm still digesting the interview myself. The thesis of it is capitalism will continually destroy (and occasionally recreate) nations to preserve itself. As he sums up: "capitalism as its most bottom-line autonomic reflex will rather arrange to kill us all than let us remake our lives communally".  This will lead to big changes in the world-system, which presents opportunities that the radical left need to seize upon and can't be afraid to do illegal work (he ends the interview with talking about the necessity to organize women, in light of the repeal of Roe vs Wade).  Has anyone else read it? Any other thoughts?

I need help learning about the communist history of Bengal To my suprise my very anti-communist dad told me there was (and probably still is) a major communist party in India called the CPI that managed to do a successful revolution and drive away the capitalists, unionize the workers and their industries and establish prolatarian power. One problem tho, according to him they just "failed" and when asked it's cuz of "the pitfalls of communism" whatever that means. Ignoring the remarks he made later on saying "workers can't do business" and "they can't adapt to market change" nonsense. I need to know what actually happened if any of you were to know or have some accurate and legit documents on the history of the party of Bengal. Much appreciated comrades.

Why feminism needs to be materialistic Hello comrades.   I am a student who will hold a presentation, answering the question "why a materialist worldview is the foundation for the emancipation of women" (I am paraphrasing this, English is not my first language, and I will present it in german, so sorry for any grammatical mistakes.) But you get the idea.. It is supposed to be a plaidoyer for a materialist feminism and should uncover why liberal feminism is not actually feminist, since it only benefits privileged women. I have worked a lot on the presentation, since my teacher is anti-marxist, it needs to be "perfect", so she can\`t touch me. I have collected some arguments and data, but maybe I am missing something... How would you argue this point? Any great sources that could support my cause? I would be immensely grateful for any kind of help. Thank you in advance, and solidaric regards!

On what will happen to exoticism in relation to "exotic food" For some reason, I can't comment on u/One_Simple8401's [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/11raafa/what_will_happen_to_exoticism_in_relation_of/) in r/communism101 so I'll post it here.  The question is: I hope to see the end of exotic food, but I wonder if this will happen?  It will when imperialist capitalism and racism ends.  I'm not familiar enough with theory to give my own answer, but I think this is relevant to your question.  >In the capitalist economy, for example, production is a dominant moment, while consumption of goods, and distribution of goods and money, are subordinate to it...Capitalist economists, for example, often try to prove that the main features of a capitalist system merely result from things like the preferences of consumers or the available technology. Theories like this pay no attention to the fact that consumer preferences are not merely causes, but are also affected by advertising and other economic activities.  Retrieved from [Introduction to Marxist Dialectics ](https://marxistphilosophy.org/Intro/DialIntro.htm)   In one aspect, we as consumers are shaped by reification through advertisements (essentially normalized propaganda) and prescribes to the capitalist rhetoric of competing for status through 'tastes' which also serves as a symbol for display that legitimizes class rule. In another aspect it would be monopoly imperialist capitalism, where race-to-the-bottom and chain stores mean that even if you avoid imported food you'll end up funding the imperialist importation anyways.  This taps into capitalism in its superstructure for instance the reinforcement of racial oppression and neocolonisation for maximization of surplus value, by segregation and nutrient deprivation - denying 'local food' access to locals into dependent compradorish exchanges and other races to subservient jobs (confining them to invisible culinary or delivery jobs) under monopoly capitalism which is the inevitable outcome from competition and growth by underdeveloping surrounding region to fill out energy-intensive capitalism's inherent urge to growth.  To address why this cannot end alone without racism, I'll problematize your definition of 'exotic food' from consumption instead of production. I'm drawing from my Asian Studies that Sakai scrutinized so mind my logic.  >as we know, many of those foods are procured in ethically and unsustainably in extremes, giving chocolate or avocados for example.  I see that you mean 'exotic food' in the sense of imported food producing emissions and distanced injustice, one of the many externalised non-costs in the chain of capitalist production. This is the production side. Have you ever wondered why 'exotic food' is named so? It'd be strange for the locals to call their food as such; this implies there's a domestic place which intakes 'the other' food but consider it foreign. Why does the consumers then name the product over the producer? Usually it would be the right of producers to name their products, right? This incurs the logic of wage labour who is objectified into a commodity and has his labour alienated into private ownership. Moreover, in close scrutiny it is partially the consumers but also how the food was promoted to them.  From content to the right to name, all of this implies a center of class and a hierarchy of consumption from the settlers' original country (hence 'domestic'), placing adjacent to 'cuisine' particularly of the colonial French type. You see colonization is not just extraction, it needs to maintain its body with local food; but as comprador private-monopoly state capitalism develops, it cannot regard local food as local as it would refer itself as 'foreign' and it needs to legitimize its ruling meanwhile preserving the semi-feudalism for oppression. What this means is that the colonial overlord culturally appropriates from his loci and alienates all production of local food as 'exotic food' of their gatekeeping, meanwhile promoting and importing their food at large costs (intially) to legitimize their and comprador's status and also  dominate the local market with bombardment of advertisements and cheap products (tin milk advertised as 'natural' and 'maternal' in Malay for instance) over the traditional wet market to sense food and feel the quality. This is a version of the 'domestic' country's indoctrination that convinces to buy whatever the value is prescribed with science coming to guarantee purity amidst all the adulteration and externalising our senses to authority (vulgarized, more precisely lack institutions in public interest). Through this, the colonizers appropriate the locals as 'the other' or later [a commercialized form of orientalism](https://reddit.com/r/communism/comments/t6ylmj/is_tolkien_reactionary/hzxo1qw/?context=999) by designating their food as inferior non-cuisines and passive until being tasted by the colonial body which renders it as nothing; claiming the robbed land to be rightfully theirs. The current form serves 'multiculturalism' to disguise imperialist appropriation and commodification of other cultures as well as homogenization of capitalist consumption 'lifestyle' (forced to sell labour to and buy from a monopoly).  This legitimization of hierarchy also occurs with procurement of spices in feudal societies, the 'gold' craze during mercantile capitalism to preserve meat, provide medicine and curiosity for royalties and capitalists, till that of cattle and sheep in imperialist capitalism where ranches for colonisers are treated as 'modernisation' regardless of ecology (also coinciding with the destruction of domestic ecology and for all that the coloniser consume, the cost is transferred, which brings a new dimension of externalising to naming 'the other' that continues in environmental justice discourses), and hence depriving indigenous land for space and energy-demanding mass plantations and ranches. We can summarize meat as a class symbol and manifestation of class relations. If you consider the class oppression in feudal societies, most peasants are lactose-intolerant (little access, with exceptions like Malay on bovine milk) and vegetarian with constant starvation. Eating imported 'exotic' food is like eating meat in this sense but with the spices, like in India where the racial caste system oppresses and confines peasants to hereditary exploitation by vices of their 'pastlife' and harvests the spices for elite consumption and trade. Which the colonizers gratefully takes over and present themselves as simply the new rajah with continuing spice production.   On the other hand, the mass production of spices and the control of the region imply that the spices can be sold dirt cheap along with the market of cookbooks sanitised for colonial wives, a degree of spices also entered the lives of the domestic poor. 'Curry' for instance become symbolic of the poor not only because Indians seek jobs in Britain from devastation of their own country and open 'curry' restaurants, but also that they are 'fashionable' and culturally appropriates into convenient, quick commercial versions for time-strapped wage labour that flooded the market, while offering a platable solution to frugal housewives to cook leftovers. Such as your case.  >Now I just focus on repurposing scraps and leftovers  'Exotic food' in another sense means quick, cheap, large sized ['unhealthy'](https://foodcorps.org/racism-in-school-food-and-what-we-can-do-about-it/) food for curiosity because you can't afford 'French cuisine'. When you think of it, food is food and nothing in particular would make it cheap unless...yes, the exploitation of surplus value from production to processing where they have to be 'tasty' (homogenised colonial and express-cooking taste) and invisible (in price and ironically local presence) lest it deters your appetite. As you hold even the fewest wealth, the locals as the underclass will defer to your preferred version because they had nothing. Such is the case for Chinese Americans after the anti-Chinese act who cannot be employed, only to open restaurants by fetishizing oriental stereotypes and race-to-the-bottom. Their vulnerability makes rife for cultural appropriation once the market consolidated and Panda Express etc appeared with lower cost, cutting the labour for more surplus value and increasing scale of production to rid competitors, and sweep the consumers away with their ignorance of authentic taste. Ask a local Chinese, they might not even know what chop suey is.  >To be truthful, I used to be one of those instagrammers, gushing over açaí bowls when I didn’t know what the hell açaí was or where it came from.  As you may already know, capitalism as the dominant ideology speaks through and reproduces in us, for instance maintaining racism to oppress and continue exploiting the labour. This [prideful ignorance](https://www.dw.com/en/opinion-culinary-ignorance-can-breed-racism/a-59215768) is in fact racism, in which you get to disrespect and cast the culture as undeserving of serious attention or equal treatment while the 'low' cost is transferred to and comes from oppression of the locals themselves; like global prostitution tourism industry where comprador countries like Thailand 'produce' transpeople to be humiliated with reward, you are doing economic tourism and claiming a masculine conquest of 'exotic food' (which is why the term is just a descendant of orientalism) while maintaining the stereotype and ideology that legislates and pressures them in their place. You're not really interested in the food's meaning persay, but in eating the food your way - it may be innocuous on the individual's part, but insidious when you see it play out structurally. [Disgust of food](https://www.brepolsonline.net/doi/pdf/10.1484/J.FOOD.1.100982) is very actionable i.e. considering the food as an extension of people as filth (diseases to become 'unhealthy', pests) that should be out of place, out of mind and can easily translate to violence, in fact in [India caste](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01419870.2021.1964558) the connection of systemic violence is explicit; you can have racists eating 'Chinese' food and assaulting them for polluting their eyes, stealing jobs etc. Further more how do you define the domestic? Sugar is still largely linked to slavery and American farms are known to use migrant workers and child labour to harvest around strong pesticides. By focusing on individual morals and co-opted FT labels over the self-destructive system, by prioritizing the alienated foreign without domestic structure in account, the exploitation in capitalist structures remains a constant and continues to steal and infest our society. If Capitalism doesn't end, so will racism never end as public violence to oppress the exploited with fear of revolt and maintain a hereditary exploitation chain. So will our relative lack of choice legitimated by the extremity of those exploited.  So I make my case for the end of capitalism and racism.

Where did the whole “Chinese police stations” in the US and Canada thing come from? Seriously I’ve been hearing this repeated from time to time but I’ve never once heard it actually come from any real source I don’t think, apart from the usual dumb ass responses like “why is no one talking about this?!” Type stuff. I just have no idea where it comes from and why people keep repeating it so much, but as you can probably guess it is always followed by some of the most naked examples of yellow peril and gross ass comments. So in short, does anyone know where this story came from and what basis in reality it has?

I known marxists.org has the 1936 and 1977 Constitutions in PDF available for download, but they seem to have only a transcript of the 1918 one.
Some words of encouragement for younger and advanced Marxists I'm often wondering about something: how come the production of theoretical, historical, artistic, etc. works of this up and coming generation of revolutionary Marxists in the imperialist countries is so low, if existing at all? I think a big part of the reason is that social media – forum posting like here, Twitter threads, maybe blogs or substack pages – dissipate a lot of intellectual energy into small, unsystematic bursts of more or less simple thoughts. You get some instant gratification from likes, shares, and upvotes and the perspective of working on something deeper and more meaningful that would require sustained study and intellectual effort becomes unappealing or is just completely falling out of sight. The deeper reason for this is obvious enough: there are no genuine vanguard parties, there is no revolutionary mass movement. No organized body exists that would demand study, a certain level of theoretical education, that would further the development of class consciousness. There's only just now an emerging labor movement again without an organized, conscious vanguard. So everyone is working either in small, disconnected groups, from within revisionist parties, or as totally isolated individuals sending their thoughts into the ether.   Naturally neither I nor anyone else here can simply will this to change. But what I want to encourage is people taking up more serious work on their own, taking study seriously – and not as an end in itself but directed towards producing something that can be helpful in advancing the current efforts to reconstitute the real movement. I've written about this before on a number of times, about how a concrete analysis of the concrete situation is a necessity for any revolutionary movement ([here](https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/vxrvpu/what_is_to_be_done/ifymlnb/) and [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/yzs8j7/my_question_on_the_vanguard_party/ix3spez/) for example). That includes studying the concrete class structure of our given national context, the given state, its strength, its weaknesses, the tendencies within the class struggle, the international situation and how it affects the internal national situation, etc. This also includes the historical background: where does the current development emerge from, what is its point of origin, its historical trajectory, the transformations it has gone through, what generalization can we make from analyzing this and which conclusions for future developments can be drawn from those? These are the most pressing issues if we want to work towards the reconstitution of an organized revolutionary communist movement, from those analyses we can then draw a political program, a party form, forms of organizing, propaganda, possible mass organizations and movements, etc.   Beyond this we also need more general theoretical investigations into specific questions like the meaning of law, [as is currently being discussed here](https://old.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/11c019t/briefly_on_law_property_legal_struggle/), the conceptualization of socialism, an update of our state theory (Stalin already pointed out the gap in understanding between his time and Lenin's studies, that gap has only widened with little revolutionary work having been done in the meantime), the lessons that can still be drawn from past struggles towards communism, the systematization and advancement of revolutionary theory that is forgotten but still has value and can be developed further with our level of the science (Pashukanis' and Stucka's work on law would be one example, we can also think of the [Soviet psychological tradition](https://www.marxists.org/subject/psychology/marxists.htm) like Vygotsky, Luruia, Leontev, etc, and we will find more as we investigate the past struggles more), advancing our understanding of fascism (very important right now as it is growing across the entire world), the political economy of imperialism, and so forth. If you are an artist who is for serious about art you can actually revive art as a real social force when you take up the struggles of the masses, get to know them, learn to create for and with them. You can overcome the alienation of art and life that capitalism has created, we can do it together within the revolutionary process. That is the only way we can rescue art from its destruction by capital.   These are all question you, me, we all can contribute to answering. It requires as prerequisite a study of the Marxist method so we can actually live up to the complexity of these problems. I've provided [some resources towards at least the study of materialist dialectics](https://old.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/spwg5q/a_collection_of_introductory_texts_on_marxist/) before. This study can be done, and it should be done by everyone who actually takes Marxism seriously (I'm not saying you need to read every single text on this list). I have done it myself, which is why I'm writing this post. I'm not proposing something I'm not already doing myself. I think capitalism makes us forget that [we actually can alter reality, that we can alter ourselves](https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/1192byf/how_do_i_change_my_familys_views/j9kamrt/?context=3), become more intelligent, educate ourselves, work towards major goals we set for ourselves, goals that we derive from the insight into objective necessity (the goal of communism if we want to survive as a species, if we want to liberate our class, overcome alienation from one another, what have you). Capitalism creates this contemplative attitude in us where we don't grasp our own agency, where we see ourselves as passive observers of the quasi-natural processes of bourgeois society which we can supposedly only bear witness to, which shove us around, but which we can't affect. But you will feel, and this has been my experience, once you take up these larger tasks, make connections with like-minded people, experience yourself getting a better grasp on the problems you're struggling with and thus start to understand reality better, as you widen your circle of like-minded people and your collective activities, you will feel your power against these deadening forces of capital.   In the coming years the situation will only become worse for the us, the masses. We will be drawn away from our cellphones, gaming consoles, computers and into the real struggle. We will need to raise our understanding of what lies ahead, how we can navigate and guide the coming struggles, what organizational forms we need, where we can find reliable comrades, how the state will react, what the limits of its power are, etc. And we can do it, not as prior to and discrete of these real struggles, but as part of them. We can contribute to the movement, we don't just have to read the classics as eternal wisdom. We can grasp their practical essence, their call to investigate our social reality, sum up, develop, and advance our theory through study and practice. Keep it alive in these struggles. I'm not a person who goes for grandiose speeches, but I want to at least try to encourage some of the people who might read this to try to escape our contemplative attitude, make an effort, and experience that you are not, in fact, condemned to complacency, that we can become agents of history of we learn its laws, combine and organize our forces and affect our reality.  E: Fixed some typos and grammar issues. Glad that some people reacted positively to this.  I want to add some comment on how to study. I've [commented before how I go about it, dealing with my bad memory and tendency to veer off](https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/yv41yt/how_do_you_personally_study_marxist_books/iwd9r1d/?context=3). I think most people will have to experiment with what works for them, since we're all a bit different regarding reading comprehension, memory, level of experience, etc.   One think I want to recommend when you want to actually go about working on a specific problem: research the fundamental literature and new literature that brings in new insights, create a bibliography of the topic that can guide your studies. You can enhance this list as you go through your studies as you will find new literature through the things you read. Sounds fairly basic but I'm not sure how many people actually go about it this systematically. It can help you a lot.

Edit: I haven't used reddit in a long time I mainly used it back when I was a young teenager, I only came to this sub to ask what happened TLDR: owner of the doc's deleted them as the resources likely led people towards revisionism and used old posts of mine as a example and I can see why, I will likely not post on reddit again but if I do I will probably just make a new account at this point

The Singularity and Socialism
What is the face of Marxism? How should a beginner study accordingly? The issue is as above (broad, shifting Marxism).  (Edited: my bad for the mess before) But! I'm asking several very different questions below:  ▪︎What is the canon?  When I'm compiling my reading lists, I observed intellectual developments of Marx with his dialectical method. While Capital is the epitome of his work, modern readers like me rely on his previous works to establish definition and context. So far on reddit I've read how some of Marx’s early works may mislead people on concepts (like alienation) and that Marx has amended Capital to a softer tone on historical materialism in his French Edition. How do beginners follow through his method and changing subject matter/events he's addressing and stances? What is the unspoken consensus of definitions? I also downloaded Hans G. Ehrbar's Annotations to Karl Marx’s ‘Capital’ with German aside to avoid lost to translation and minimize inaccuracies in definition. Any suggestion on how to grasp the relative 'canon' in the flow of debates?  E (10/3/23): see comments below.  ▪︎How to read academic book/alternate frames on current issues (through the jargon/bias)?  When we reference books, there's often an unspoken canon as the standard basis in the acadmic's head. This 'authenticity' is often constantly revised by academia industry, which is rather difficult to follow for outsiders. Engels is said to 'vulgarize' Marx’s manuscripts and obscures an authentic reading. With this shifting Marxism, if we want to consult Marx’s interpretation on current issues, how do we get through the 'revisionism' and inconsistency in academic stuff? How critical should we be when reading journals and like? Any favourite academics?  ▪︎How to read Marx under late stage capitalism with imperialist propaganda?  When I read Marx I'm never sure I'm reading Marx or an interpretation from myself or others. Under neoliberal propaganda and age of information overload, I fill the lines of Marx with my knowledge of context, but the mental dissonance and my indoctrination can always get better of me with my inability to assess theory. For instance in another case, how do I know if I think in chauvinistic ways when inspecting postcolonial literature as a citizen of a previously colonized country (brought aware by J. Sakai)? Recommending readings on biases would help a lot.  E (11/3/23): Marxism as science https://reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/txsdkp/is_marxism_a_method_of_analysis_or_a_theory_that/i3tai80/?context=999 supplementing the MLM list  Begin by debunking science from idealism and racism in https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/acy4p2/can_anyone_explain_to_me_althussers_distinction/ and https://reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/bfrvdb/how_is_marxism_a_science/eli7xd7/?context=999 alongside readmarxeveryday.org's recs to clarify misunderstandings of issues  ▪︎How to track the development of legit Marxism and evaluate theory?  Marxism is a broad term. Marx arguably says that he is no Marxist, yet beginners rely on Marxists and communists to understand the context of Marx and Marxism's revolutionary significance. Hence the confusion with conflicting premises. From the books I used as crutches to reddit threads in here and r/askphilosophy, I gleaned that there's various valid 'revisionist' contributions to Marxism from Trotskyists like Ernest Mandel (whose preface of Capital is in the version I am reading), Postmodernists like Althusser, Foucault and Judith Butler, Neo-Marxists and many of us reflecting on the current era or after the rigorous application of Marx’s theory in Soviet Union etc. Marx and Engels did explicitly say that their work is not for utopianism and for practical implementation and contemporary adaptation. So how do we know the above experiences (easier to research on tho no less controversial) and extensions of Marx’s arguments are valid enough adaptations of Marxism?   In a post, r/smokeuptheweed9 referred bourgeosie science as a degraded form of Marxism and 'philosophy' as poor dialectical materialism. Can someone explain that for me? How is it so?  ▪︎Last question on dogmatism and self-study  As beginners we stick to trusty interpretations like Lenin, Althusser etc, but things don't work like on paper so we'll definitely look into events around us and try praxis (which is really our motivation). But before that when we begin we take words at face value, possibly leading to dogmatism. How do we differentiate fundamentals/anti-revisionism from dogmatism? How to learn to organize people or any small things to do to achieve praxis?  I'm also reading Krupskaya's On Education alongside for more insights on self-study, any comments?  I don't expect too much, answering any one section is fine. By commenting, you make my day! Thanks for reading!
Has there been any modern academic developments of Engels’ ‘The Origin of Family’? Engels’ book “The Origin of Family, Private Property and the State” is a great book to understand the application of Dialectical Materialism to the development of society, family structures and gender relations. However, much of the book is Engels’ own conclusions and theories derived from secondary sources and the application of dialectical materialism to the data available to him. Obviously, the logical conclusion of his discoveries being anti-capitalist it is obvious that his writing has been relentlessly suppressed in academic circles. From what I know of Marxist theory, I perfectly understand the book and agree with its conclusions but I personally don’t have enough knowledge on the subject to accommodate for the later discoveries in the field of anthropology, so I hesitate to cite the book authoritatively in discussions on this subject.  Have there been any academic developments in the same direction, any books or articles that expand on Engels’ understanding of the family and its historical development that I can read to better understand this subject (with latest anthropological data)?

Sources on Georgia and US-led imperialism's offensive in the Post-Soviet Space As you [may be aware](https://strana.best/news/427511-video-shturma-zdanija-parlamenta-v-hruzii-8-marta-2023-hoda.html), there are currently some anti-govt riots in Tbilisi against what is being referred to as a "Russian law" regulating the foreign financing of NGOs by the "pro-european/NATO" petty bourgeoisie.   I am familiar with some of the english language "marxist" NGOers, particularly the ones popularized by the German regime's "RosaLux" foundation projects such as LeftEast. I'm not looking for more of those. I have also read the archives of Monthly Review, though they unfortunately are limited in historical and analytical scope. I'm also familiar with Dilyana Gaytandzhieva's journalism.  If anyone has anti-imperialist sources (books, documentaries, sites etc), either on [post-]Soviet Georgian history and/or the more contemporary role of US-led imperialist forces (monopolies, security services, militaries etc) in Georgia please share. They can be in any language.

Marxist/communist perspective on Arendt’s Totalitarianism? Hello comrades!   I was wondering if any of you have read The Origins of Totalitarianism by Hannah Arendt and what you thought of it from a marxist/communist perspective.  I have not read the book yet, but I do plan on getting it very soon.   I know that Arendt was an anti-communist and gives a liberal bourgeois interpretation of what she calls “totalitarianism”.  Other research that I have done prior to my impending purchase of the book is that she paints an inaccurate picture of Stalin, Bolshevism and the Soviet Union as a whole and compares it to Nazi Germany’s “totalitarianism”?  Any insight is appreciated on Arendt and/or this particular book. :)
Soviet publication about ww2 A while ago I found a soviet publication in english talking about how Germany industrialised after ww1 with the help of western companies and banks, but I've lost the PDF file since then and no matter how much I search I can't find it.

What makes Western Sahara unique? The Western Sahara seems to be right up there with Palestine in issues of central concern for anti-imperialists, communists, etc. as an obvious case of overt colonialism. I’ve even heard it described as “Africa’s last colony.”  While I'm totally on board on the issue, I don't understand what makes it so different from any number of cases across the African continent (or beyond) where particular geographic and ethnic groups dispute the rule of the nation of which they're under control, asserting a separate national identity against the (perceived?) exploitation of their land and resources. (I'm not arguing that it isn't different, I would just like to know more, as I don't know the case very well.)  More broadly, I suppose I don't understand how communists see the question of the nation and its contradictions with Marxist internationalism, but that's a whole different question.
How should Marxists relate to "right-wing anti-imperialism" in the Global South? It seems to me that one of the major divisions on the left is regarding how we should understand and respond to what I’ll call right-wing anti-imperialist governments. That may be the wrong term, but by that I mean: governments or political movements in the Global South that are opposed to the United States and its imperial domination of their nation, but whose project domestically is far from a socialist/communist one. In fact, in some cases they may even be violently anti-communist. To take one example: the Taliban government of Afghanistan is anti-Western and anti-US domination, but has a reactionary political project domestically.   To simplify: On the one hand, ridding a nation of imperial domination and robbing the US of its plundered resources and military foothold in that nation would seem to help to tilt the global balance of forces away from US hegemony. On the other, that government may, to varying degrees, be actively opposing and suppressing the emergence of left-wing forces and a socialist/communist project domestically.  In my experience, to one extreme, there are those on the left who buy fully and uncritically into supporting these governments. On the other extreme, there are those who support any and all forms of opposition to these governments, even if it means supporting US imperial policies.  And there is a whole landscape of positions — which I would imagine is the vast majority of the left — somewhere in between.   Recognizing that each case is different**, how should the Western left relate to these governments or movements**, besides the clear baseline of opposing US imperial aggression against them? How can we best oppose imperialist US actions like sanctions or war without also strengthening the right-wing domestic projects? How should domestic left forces in these countries seek to build power and transform their societies without buying into or aligning with US-backed imperial interests? In particular, what about when the right-wing anti-imperialist government is heavily repressive and closed to internal political dissent, and certain liberal opposition forces, if in power, might allow for a greater degree of “liberal” political openness, but might also be more US-aligned.   &#x200B;  My question is not just for your advice in answering these questions, but \*also\*, and more importantly: **what are the defining works of theory on these tensions?** Is the division in approaches to these questions tied to particular, defined schools of thought? Are there certain definitive works that have guided the different perspectives on these questions? I'd love to read more.  Or, if my premise itself is wrong, please do tell me why. Thanks!

Does anyone else remember a socialist version of "Down To The River To Pray" about May Day? I remember that the version I heard was sung entirely by women, presumably American, and couldn't have been more than probably five singers in total. I remember that it changed "And who shall wear the robe and crown, Good Lord, show me the way" to something along the lines of "and who shall wear the red \[...\], Karl Marx, show me the way" and the refrain was about marching on the first of May.  Does anyone else remember this song? I can't find it, or any mention of it, anywhere. I had to have last heard the song five years ago, and it was on Youtube.
Gaza air defense, Nizar Banat, and Iran defeating the defeatists
News from Yemen? Hi there. I've been looking to follow the conflict in Yemen a bit more closely. Does anyone have a good source of information about what's going on there? Also, how much support do you guys think the rebels are deserving of? Personally, I see them very much as an anti-imperialist force bravely struggling for the liberation of their country from foreign occupation. But there's a lot of conflicting info on the Houthis. One source will say they are heavily anti-Semitic, but I found another one explaining there are actually Jewish soldiers fighting for the Houthis. One source will claim Ansar Allah is an Islamist sect seeking to establish a regime identical to that in Iran in Yemen, but I've also read statements from Houthi commanders who claim to be fighting for the establishment of a pluralistic, democratic republic under Islamic influence. Lots of Western MSM claims that Yemen under the Houthis is a hopelessly miserable, brutal regime, but they never provide evidence. At some point, you just have to choose who to trust, and I happen to trust the Houthis more than the Saudis. Where can I find some less obscure stuff on these guys? Any good reading recommendations? Thank you.

Positive accounts of communism Can anyone point me to first-hand accounts of positive experiences with socialism/communism? I’d like to provide people who bring it up with a counterbalance to the many individual accounts of “this is how awful Cuba/China/USSR was so I left and now I’m here telling you how bad it was,” which of course never account for the class context of those stories (i.e., “I wasn’t really down with socializing property because I had a lot of it and was living cush off workers’ efforts til they took it away:’(“ ). I’d like to be able to give a human face to the argument “wait a minute, all these many people got healthcare, literacy, and a meaningful chance at dignified work as a result of socialization.”  I know it exists because you can see it isn’t he subtext of a lot of sources, but I’d like to find some individual accounts to provide that personal element.
GA Cohen and Analytical Marxism Can anyone tell me what exactly "Analytical Marxism" even means? I really can't find anything substantive, only "analytical Marxism is BS."  I understand that the distinction between the anglophone analytical tradition and "continental" philosophy amounts essentially to an attempt to make philosophy more scientific.  Basically, can anyone explain what an analytical approach to Marxism would even look like? For instance, a lot of the interviews I have seen of GA Cohen seem to be him defending traditional Marxist views. What makes his approach "analytic" or what would be an example of an analytic approach to Marxism more generally?

Socialist critique of USSR? Hello everyone, I'm from the Baltics and while still in highschool during history/literature lessons I have to always listen to pro western, "communism never worked" type of stuff. Specifically in this region there is a lot of talk about, even in the official media of the trauma of living in the USSR. I would love to read some book about the actual policies that made the life in the USSR traumatic, preferably from the marxist perspective. Or in general, what was the life like in the USSR(with a balanced view)

Chinese 12-point peace plan | "China's position on a political settlement of the Ukrainian crisis"
Briefly on Law, Property & Legal Struggle I've wanted to write something of this sort for a while now, but had little time to set aside. Now I've attempted to take a stab at it within the few hours I have free today. I was inspired by the steady stream of posters asking about legal struggle and how "the law" will apply after the revolution (specifically in regards to how it will apply to them and their property, however the question is cloaked). Obviously this isn't a final pointed end of the discussion and I can't come close to covering the ground that all the relevant books and historical examples could, but I feel that some points had to be addressed, however indirectly I address them.  I hope to make this broad topic accessible with a brief touch upon a concrete example: property law in the various constitutions of the PRC. This example is useful because there have been both bourgeois and socialist legal struggles over property in China in very recent historical memory, and we get to see this in the transparent and pointed wording of legal and political documents. It is further helpful since the same individuals who fetishize the law seem to fetishize China; I think because both represent a challenge to the current that does not overcome the bourgeois form (ie: both the law and the rise of China represent bourgeois challenges that may lift one's quality of life without overcoming the bourgeois form).  Before that, it is most fundamental to understand what law is; here in summarized form. Most simply, "law" is born out of and facilitates the exchange of commodities. In cell form, where labour is first alienated from labouring persons and becomes objectified in their products as an apparently-natural quality external to the labourer (value), the law mediates the transformation of potential value into realized value (and vice versa) through the social process of exchange. That is to say, a person's active labour become embodied in a thing and is its potential value, but to realize the value the thing must then be appropriated and brought to market by a real person who thus imposes their will upon the object.    > Therefore, simultaneously with the product of labour assuming the quality of a commodity and becoming the bearer of value, man assumes the quality of a legal subject and becomes the bearer of a legal right.  - Pashukanis, The General Theory of Law and Marxism  In other words, "law" emerges logically and historically to mediate the relationship between a person and a product of labour, and mediates the relationship between people seeking exchange - law is wielded by both exchangers of commodities, and legal right is mutually recognized to facilitate said exchange. In still other words:  > In order that these objects may relate to one another as commodities, their guardians must relate to one another, as persons whose will resides in those objects; and must behave in such a way that each does not appropriate the commodity of the other, and part with his own, except by means of an act done by mutual consent. They must, therefore, mutually recognize in each other the rights of private proprietors.  - Marx, Capital (cited directly by Pashukanis)  And so, the "concrete pecularities" of each human relating to one another (and to their products) "are dissolved into the abstraction of man in general as a legal subject" - the foundation. The accumulation of such abstractions to legal right over time is "Law" (capital L), which confronts each individual owner as a natural, eternal and external thing, and such accumulation heretofore culminates in bourgeois society where all have a commodity to exchange on the market (ie: their labour; hence "universal human rights"). Consequently, the law extends farthest and widest in bourgeois society.  Jumping back in history and logic, "property" (land included in this) refers to all product that is alienated and appropriated (ie: all things made a commodity, a carrier of objectified human labour and thus relating to people as the "owner" and "potential owner" etc):  > ......natural or organic forms of appropriation obtain a legal character and begin to display their legal “intelligence” in mutual acts of appropriation and alienation....... Both exchange-value and the law of property are generated by one and the same phenomenon: the circulation of products which have become commodities. Property in the legal sense appeared not because people decided to assign this legal quality, but because they could exchange commodities only having donned the personality of an owner.  - Pashukanis  This is why there is no such thing as "personal property" in bourgeois society; there is only private property, and the "law" protects ownership rights to facilitate its mobility and its social exchange.   Mystifying even further, additional abstractions emerge as vehicles of commodity circulation (to overcome constraints on it) which are inextricably linked to legal right and private property, such as the family. To choose one quote from Engels:  > The original meaning of the word “family” (familia) is not that compound of sentimentality and domestic strife which forms the ideal of the present-day philistine; among the Romans it did not at first even refer to the married pair and their children, but only to the slaves. Famulus means domestic slave, and familia is the total number of slaves belonging to one man. As late as the time of Gaius, the familia, id est patrimonium (family, that is, the patrimony, the inheritance) was bequeathed by will.   - Engels: The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State  The family has been transformed through changes in modes of production, and as Engels showed these transformations are reflected in law as in, for example, descent and distribution of property (inheritance). Yet the family, as is the legal right, is not eternal but definitely emerged, logically and historically. Understanding this emergence and the subsequent transformations through different modes of production is key to understanding the place of the law and of legal struggle for communists, ie: how to harness them and how to transform and wield them, including in regards to the family and "family right" (what social grouping does the law address now, and what later?). After all, bourgeois jurists certainly exploited the law available to them to the fullest extent they could to fully free feudal property from its fetters and make it available and mobile for appropriation and exchange (pre and post revolution), and in the age of globalization/imperialism, Law extends across the globe.  Therefore, the place of the law and of legal struggle for communists is not to simply fight for equal rights or a better share of the pie for all, but to actively and consciously analyze, harness, transform, and to impose and enforce laws that nudge society in direction of communism  (ie: to undo the need for law itself as its material foundation dissolves). As there is a place for the state, there is a place for law and legal struggle, since private property is not simply overthrown and overcome. Consider:  > Class struggle frequently led in history to a new distribution of property, to the expropriation of money lenders and owners of latifundia. But these upheavals, however unpleasant they were for the classes and groups that suffered, did not disturb the basic foundations of private property – the economic fact of economic transactions by exchange. Those people who rose up against property, on the next day had to affirm it, meeting in the market place as independent producers. This is the path of all non-proletarian revolutions. Such is the logical conclusion from the ideal of anarchists who, discarding the external signs of bourgeois law – state compulsion and statutes – maintain its internal essence: free contract between independent producers.  - Pashukanis   In addition, this doesn't preclude the possibility of exploiting bourgeois right to the fullest in pursuit of the revolution, as Lenin so masterfully theorized so many times, but I will emphasize that it does mean that legal and political struggle has a conscious aim of understanding and overcoming these forms (not seizing them and preserving them through half-baked ideas to squeeze out further benefits in the imperial core). One is not, for example, a communist lawyer or politician, but a communist who exploits the legal and political forms that are available, and consciously works to transform them to serve the revolution through the dictatorship of the proletariat (a legal and political form that serves socialism). I wanted to write more about this but instead I would encourage all to simply read Lenin more thoroughly and in context. The point is that a bourgeois form of a concept/thing cannot be the foundation of a revolutionary action, and I think that trips up a lot of posters.   Turning to the concrete example of China (very briefly), we can see how legal and political struggle is waged over property by both communists and bourgeois actors, and I think we get the chance to read between the lines and see how the PRC has grown to represent the ideas many socialist-sympathizers get surrounding property and the law. For expediency I think it is best to consider the transparent language concerning property in the various legal and political documents of China from 1949 onward, and unfortunately skip the pre-revolutionary struggle. Beginning with the 1954 constitution, when the revolution was but 5 years old, the law said:  > The public property of the People's Republic of China is sacred and inviolable. It is the duty of every citizen to respect and protect public property.  - Article 101, 1954 Constitution of the People's Republic of China  ...and simultaneously said:  > The state protects the rights of citizens to inherit private property according to law.  ....hedging it with "The state forbids any person to use his private property to the detriment of the public interest." (articles 12 and 14), and while acknowledging that the existence of some individual ownership is transitional in nature and not meant to last, as individual producers are encouraged to organize co-operatively. While multiple forms of property ownership still existed at the time (including some capitalist ownership), legal and political avenues were thus used in pursuit of the revolution, as the constitution clearly explains (it's not long and you can read the whole thing online). I think it's worthwhile to note that legal and political means were utilized to appropriate land for the socialist cause, ie "The state may, in the public interest, buy, requisition or nationalize land" and "The state deprives feudal landlords and bureaucrat-capitalists of political rights for a specific period of time according to law; at the same time it provides them with a way to earn a living, in order to enable them to reform through work and become citizens who earn their livelihood by their own labour.". This comes in handy when directly comparing to modern PRC law; here the law, emerging from appropriation and ownership, is turned against it.  The 1975 constitution was much shorter (30 articles, available online) and provided:  > In the People's Republic of China, there are two kinds of ownership of the means of production at the current stage: socialist ownership by the whole people and socialist collective ownership by the working people. The state may allow non-agricultural individual labourers to engage in individual labour involving no exploitation of others, within the limits permitted by law and under unified arrangement by neighbourhood organizations in cities and towns or by production teams in rural people's communes. At the same time, these individual labourers should be guided onto the road of socialist collectivization step by step......Socialist public property shall be inviolable......  This is another step forward from 1954, as legal and political channels are thus utilized to further the steps away from private property while protecting the citizens' rights of ownership of their income from work, their savings, their houses, and other means of livelihood (though there is no mention of private inheritance). Further, it was written that rural commune members were allowed small individual plots for their personal needs and to engage in limited household side-line production. As Zhang Chunqiao said, this is adherence to socialism with necessary flexibility, notably rejecting Liu Shaoqi's ideas of individual household output quotas and Lin Biao's ideas of abolishing individual farm plots for personal needs. This constitution also included "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work".   Now consider the language of the 1982 constitution, which was amended several times. In 1982 the right to inherit private property was re-added to the article about owning "lawful property" (not "livelihood" as in 1975) and the following was said:  > The individual economy of urban and rural working people,  operated within the limits prescribed by law, is a complement to the socialist public economy. The state protects the lawful rights and interests of the individual economy. The state guides, helps and supervises the individual economy by exercising administrative control.  In 1988 "The State protects the lawful rights and interests of the private sector of the economy, and exercises guidance, supervision and control over the private sector of the economy", in 1999 "Individual, private and other non-public economies that exist within the limits prescribed by law are major components of the socialist market economy.....the State protects the lawful rights and interests of individual and private economies, and guides, supervises and administers individual and private economies.", and in 2004:  > Citizens’ lawful private property is inviolable. The state shall protect the right of citizens to own and inherit private property in accordance with the provisions of law. The state may, in order to meet the demands of the public interest and in accordance with the provisions of law, expropriate or requisition citizens’ private property and furnish compensation.   As legal and political avenues were used in pursuit of revolutionary aims pre-1976, so too are legal and political avenues open post-1976 to facilitate private property and market exchange between individuals. Obviously this change in lawmaking coincides with reform and opening-up, which is the most obvious example of smashing the fetters put on the circulation of commodities. Notably, as the law provided for the appropriation of land for socialist causes in 1954 and 1975, in 2021::  > For the need of the public interest, the collectively-owned land and the houses and other immovable property of an organization or individual may be expropriated within the scope of authority and pursuant to the procedures provided by law.  - Article 243, Civil Code of China  If you read further on, the expropriated are to be furnished with compensation, within the law, ie the property is appropriated while recognizing the rights of the original owners. Once you read the articles about the property owners right to usufruct/security interest/general benefit (no deprivation for landlords here), the recognition of the expropriated's "right" is perhaps more easily understood. The point for the bourgeois lawmakers is to get the most exchange value out of the land possible ie: to mobilize it for maximal circulation of commodities, and to struggle legally and politically to the fullest extent to ensure that this happens. This is a market [sic] distinction from the socialist lawmaking project of making land available for the collective production and distribution of use-values. The more wide-ranging and complicated market exchange becomes, the more ground that law must cover. Is it a lazy analogy to point out that the 1975 constitution had 30 articles (much less than 1954) and the 2021 civil code has 1260 (the section on ownership alone having hundreds)? Perhaps......  In closing, while legal right is an abstraction from the concrete act of appropriation and exchange and thus the law cannot be ignored by Marxists, one must not think that the law can be worked with as it exists as a primary vehicle to accomplish revolutionary aims (in this case in regard to property). Do not take such social forms (law, family etc.) at their bourgeois face-value; they have logical and historical origin points and several millenia of accumulations and transformations that must be understood. For any sort of legal struggle to be waged, the law must be submitted to the strictest critical analysis, lest it be fetishized in its bourgeois form as the protector of everyone's equal right to appropriate and to exchange.  Anyhow, I encourage everyone to read each constitution of China, with their amendments, and to read the recently-released civil code to fully understand how the law is utilized by communists and by the bourgeois to serve their respective aims. I also encourage a thorough reading of Pashukanis, Marx, Engels and Lenin - even a simultaneous reading - to better understand what I am only able to stab at here with a few paragraphs and quotes. The Soviet constitutions are out there too. I regret ending on such a punctuated note, but perhaps the comments section can help fill in the large gaps I've left and correct the mistakes I've written.

Under historical/modern communist-inspired regimes, were there any popular "scams" or "grifts" meant to deceive for individual gain? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Hi, before we begin, I'm pro communism and I'm not calling communism a scam, grift, con, or otherwise degrading it. This is more of a curious historical question than a troll. I've lived at a commune in the US for the last two years of my life. Check my post history.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  For Context: It seems like all my older family members are getting scammed lately. $500 here, $1000 there, credit card fraud in this other place, full computer access and keyloggers installed and a call to the family computer guy (i.e. me). Nigerian price emails are a dime a dozen and ***STILL*** make tons of money even to this day, enough to make it worthwhile.  I've tried searching this and reading a little bit but I haven't found an answer.   I'm not super versed on communist history or theory: Were there any popular or well-known scams, grifts, or cons for additional benefits or special gain during any of the times that any communist flavors have been tried?  **EDIT**I am looking for documented examples with sources.

Being a progressive leftist in Eastern Europe Hi, im not sure how to talk about this or how to phrase this but I'd like to hear about experiences of other Eastern Europe progressive leftist because I find myself in a really akward position. In Slovakia left wing = ultra conservative and conspiracy theorists. For most Slovaks it's unthinkable to combine marxism and any progressive ideas. I'm sure that this happens in the west as well however i also often see liberals being called communist in the west.  Here's an anecdote that made me make this post. I wanted to find some Slovak marxist writers to read and I found this 1920s collective called DAV. It's your average marxist magazine talking about politics, culture, art and philosophy. I wanted to know more so i googled DAV magazine and i found "dav dva" (dav two). It's supposed to be successor to the original DAV but it's an anti vax and pro russian conspiracy web. Also one of the writes in dav dva is Luboš blaha - a corrupt pro russian degenerare.  So yeah i want to hear about your experiences and as a marxist in Eastern Europe.  (I'm still new to this so feel free to correct me especially if you're a Slovak and please don't be too harsh :) )
Looking for an historical book. So I have a good friend that has been talking to me about a book, a book about how nazis didn't disappear from germany, a lot of them were not actually captured or imprisoned, and how they were actually pretty powerful even after the war. According to him, the book is from the 50s and it was written by an east german researcher. Could someone help me?

Do you guys know any good documentaries/yt videos about Cuban doctors and Cuban health care? What i am asking for is kind of specific i know. I was talking to my non marxist girlfriend and educating her on the successes of previous socialist projects because she busted out the “socialism only works on paper” argument. So i mentioned a bunch of them and of course i had to mention the quality of health care in Cuba, how they have some of the best doctors especially for such a small embargoed country, how they even help their neighboring countries etc. She got really excited about that so if you friends have any video or documentary that me and her can watch together feel free to recommend it.
What is on the table?  I pretty consistently come across texts expounding the structural limits of organizing today, especially in the imperial core. Sloganeering and Marching is just movementism. Propaganda of the deed is terrorism. Trade Unions can offer concessions from capital but unless you do something (what exactly?) they devolve into an economism that also is dead in the water. The imperial core has no peasant class to organize and while the lumpen have disputable revolutionary potential I’ve not seen any real forms of organization that they can be channeled through.   Add onto this the different ideas of what a party form even looks like, think J Maufowad Paul, I feel there seems to be a level of liquidationism and fatalism that can’t be overcome theoretically.

What are some good books on the impact of the Soviet Union on global socialist and anti-imperialist movements? I find that liberals are usually extremely ignorant about the material aid and inspirational force that the Soviet Union represented to oppressed peoples all over the world. Books on the SU also usually hyper-focus on the internal political events and it's hard to really dig into how they concretely spread socialism abroad. What are some good resources that you would suggest?

Opinion on 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia?  On 20–21 August 1968, the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic was jointly invaded by four Warsaw Pact countries: the Soviet Union, the Polish People's Republic, the People's Republic of Bulgaria and the Hungarian People's Republic. Only Warsaw pact countries Romania and Albania supported Czechoslovakia. The invasion stopped president Alexander Dubček's Prague Spring liberalisation reforms and strengthened the authoritarian wing of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. Soviet troops remained in Czechoslovakia until 1991. Thoughts?

Arikkad Varghese: Death Anniversary of An Immortal Comrade
Thoughts on plastic surgeries and similar stuff? As we all know, our society places certain standards upon us. To follow these standards, some people seek medical intervention. Sometimes it's something as simple as antidepressants, sometimes it's plastic surgeries such as changing the shape of your face, sometimes it's surgeries to make your body look accordingly to your gender identity (whether it's fixing gynecomastia for cis men, sex reassignment surgery or hormone replacement therapy for trans people, or something else). This can result in complications and sometimes even death. I think most communists would agree that the society's standards of how a person should look can be very toxic. That being said, those standards don't disappear if you refuse the person said surgery (or other medical interventions). Even in absence of societal standards, there are 8 billion people and counting, there are bound to be some people who want to modify their body, even if it may potentially cause them harm.  With that in mind, what do you all think of using medicine in cases where it fulfills a want rather than a need? Mental wellbeing is important, and of course poor mental health can lead to suicide. On the other hand, euthanasia can be a want too - should that be satisfied by the society? It's also generally agreed upon here that trans people shouldn't be denied transition care, but it's not clear to what extent (for example, transmedicalists argue that people should only be able to medically transition if it's medically necessary, but there are trans people who don't consider transition medically necessary and are able to live on without it, but still prefer it to not transitioning). I'm interested in what is the proper Marxist way to think about this.

Could anyone recommend some reading on the Polish People’s Republic? Hello, I’ve converted to Marxism-Leninism from anarchism a little over a year ago and since then I’ve done much essential reading regarding the ideology as well as most discussed socialist states like the USSR, the PRC and Cuba. I find it somewhat concerning however, that I know comparatively little about my home country.   This is not for the lack of trying, but it’s really hard to find an unbiased source. Most books that are available were written by the new class of “entrepreneurs” that sprang up during privatization after socialism fell. They are obviously heavily biased and staunchly anti-communist. Talking to people reveals little. All middle and upper class people that I talked to say it was the worst thing to ever happen to Poland (imagine my shock). As for the working class, my grandparents’ generation, so people born in the early 50s, remembers it very fondly. My parents less so, they mostly remember the unrest and the following collapse of the socialist government.   That’s not very much to go on, so I ask you comrades to recommend me some reading.

Are you involved in local Cooperatives? The core feature of capitalism is production for exchange. As long as that remains the dominant mode of production, what is profitable will dictate market behavior, which inevitably means that the distinction between coops and regular companies will be reduced and then eliminated, as workers will be forced to exploit themselves to remain competitive in the same way that the market forced their former employers to behave in the same way.
Materialist Analysis of Homophobia in the Middle East Hello, everyone: I’ve been seeing a lot of liberal circles online talking about how they are weary of supporting movements such as the liberation of Palestine because of homophobia and conservative social beliefs in the region.

How can we effectively show liberals that supporting these resistance movements is not an endorsement of their archaic stances?

Small town recruiting A friend of mine and I have recently started a reading group where we read the writings of prominent communist theorists. So far we've only read What is to be Done? by Lenin and will be discussing On Authority by Engels soon. I'm new to being a communist, while my friend has been one for a while and has been guiding me through the basics. We both live in small towns that are nearby and we'd like to recruit some more people. Unfortunately, neither of us personally know anyone who would be interested and neither of us are comfortable with outing ourselves. Some of my coworkers have expressed disdain for unions so I'd very much like to avoid any of them knowing about my political leanings. Any advice would be very much appreciated.
Yakov Sverdlov It's coming up on the anniversary of the death of one of the most influential revolutionaries      Yakov Sverdlov (1885-1919) was a Bolshevik revolutionary and Soviet politician who played a key role in the Russian Revolution of 1917. He served as the first chairman of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee, which was the highest legislative body in the new Soviet state. Sverdlov was known for his organizational and leadership skills, but ironically enough, he died of a worldwide pandemic over 100 years prior at the age of 33 due to a case of influenza during the Russian Civil War. He was a close associate of Vladimir Lenin and helped to consolidate the Bolsheviks' power in the early years of the Soviet Union. However, his legacy has been somewhat overshadowed by later Soviet leaders such as Stalin, who became dominant figures in the Communist Party.
Any Communist Jazz Musicians? I am a jazz musician and have been thinking about a project for a while where I create jazz renditions of the biggest leftist songs and put together a sort-of 'communist jazz album'. I, however, only play sax, piano, and drumset (poorly). If anyone out there is interested in this idea and is also a jazz musician, feel free to send me a DM. Specifically, I am looking for a trumpet player, a piano player, a drumset player, and a bass player (other instruments welcome). Jazz composers are also welcome. You must have a good microphone to record with as you would record your part, send it to me, and then I would put it together with the other parts.  EDIT: Ok I may have been unclear before I mean people on this sub who are jazz musicians I am trying to put together an ensemble, please do not tell me names of other, famous or dead jazz musicians.

Untranslated Pierre Vilar Works There was a post on here some time ago lamenting that much of Pierre Vilar's work has not been translated to English. Which of his books would be most worthwhile to translate? I have been meaning to do so as a personal project for some time and figure it would be best to at least share it with people who might be interested.  I was thinking of The Spanish Civil War but if there is another work that is more of interest then I will do that one.

Thesis Help- Connection between colonialism in Latin America and the Pink Tide I'm writing my thesis on the connection between colonialism in Latin America and the current Pink Tide. My basic hypothesis is that colonialism led to major class and land issues, that eventually led to the Pink Tide today. (More or less)  I'm looking for literature/thoughts/opinions to help me please.   I am a communist in a conservative American university, and my professor doesn't think my project is good, so I would love to prove the connection, if there is any.   Thank you!
People's Revolutionary Party Statement on Popular Resistance in Palestine
Has anyone read Hindess and Hirst's Pre-capitalist Modes of Production? Is it worth reading? What does it get right and wrong? For background, I want to understand how to correctly apply Marxist theory to the analysis of concrete conjunctures as a guide to practical action.  I think that is the purpose of Marxist theory.  Although this book does not go into the analysis of concrete situations, it does attempt a rigorous and systematic exposition of the general theoretical concepts belonging to the Marxist theory of modes of production.  In order to understand how to analyse concrete conjunctures, it is first necessary to understand these concepts.  The exposition of these concepts, in turn, should serve as a guide to the scientific method of theoretical abstraction in general.  That is why I am planning to study this book.  I get the impression (but I'm not sure) that the authors came out of the Althusserian/structural Marxist tradition.  I also saw the book was criticized by the analytical Marxist Derek Sayer in *The Violence of Abstraction*.  I've heard good things about Althusser and bad things about analytical Marxism, so I figure the Hindess and Hirst book is likely to have some useful content even if it gets some points wrong.  So far, I have read through the introduction a few times.  The manner of presentation is clear and the content is interesting.  However, a few points have surprised me.  Notably, the authors say, "A mode of production is an articulated combination of relations and forces of production structured by the dominance of the relations of production."  I had thought the productive forces played the dominant role, rather than the production relations.  Also, the authors remark that "the transition between one mode of production and another must be conceived in a non-evolutionary form."  I suppose the authors' reasoning on both these points will become clearer as I continue reading.  Has anyone read this book?  What are the main points it gets right and wrong?  Is it even worth reading?
Warning: the "Marxist-Leninist" book publisher, Red Star Publishers, is a violently transphobic organization. They publish a journal called "Towards Marxist-Leninist Unity". In the July 2019 issue of it, they wrote extensively about "transgender ideology" and "transgenderism". They also wrote, at length, about how trans women do or are responsible for the following:      1. How trans women are rapists   2. How trans women force cis women to look at "hard erections" in sports locker rooms   3. How trans women colonize women's spaces   4. How trans women have unfair advantages in women's sports   5. How trans women are eliminating women's spaces   6. How trans women undo cis women's progress   7. How trans rights are funded by the CIA      They also say that Workers World Party, the Party of Communists USA, and other organizations are bad for supporting trans rights.      Here is the journal issue in which they state all this:      http://redstarpublishers.org/TMLUv1n2.pdf      Edit: The best part is that - despite all sociological and academic research - they claim all of us are upper class white men and that working class and black and brown people aren't trans.
Unions in Lahore? As the title suggests, do any of you know of any prominent Worker's Unions in Lahore, Pakistan?

Wikipedia is a capitalist organization If you don't know, Wikipedia is run by a hyper-capitalist hierarchy. The system works like this: at the very top there are "stewards", they have full power over all wikis and have most of their activities hidden from scrutiny. Below them each wiki appoints an Arbitration Committee (hereinafter ArbCom), this is supposedly democratically elected, but is really rigged. Each ArbCom appoints two groups of users: Oversights, whose job is supposed to be to remove private information that was unintentionally publicly exposed, but in reality they heavily abuse this power to hide all real criticism of them and other insiders. CheckUsers, who investigate "sockpuppetry" which is when a user creates another account after being blocked from editing by an admin. This activity is forbidden on Wikipedia and all edits made by "Sockpuppets" (hereinafter "socks") are removed, regardless of if they were beneficial or harmful. Checkusers job is to investigate cases of sockpuppetry and to block the sockpuppets. They are able to view editors private information to find other accounts using the same or similar information to do it. The information is kept for only 90 days to comply with government regulations, but a lot of it is illegally moved onto a separate, private wiki hidden from scrutiny, where it is illegally kept for ever. Another level of user is bureaucrats, their job is to appoint the lower groups below them. Below bureaucrats are administrators, who are supposed to mainly block vandals and spammers, but they are EXTREMELY corrupt and block anyone that disagrees with them and bully people into submission.

Does anyone have any resources for learning 12 dialectical categories in dialectical materialism? Lunaoi has a video on it but that and like one resource on Google is pretty much all I can find.   Does anyone know of any other resources to learn the 6 dialectical pairs : private vs common  reason vs result,obviousness vs randomness, essence vs phenomenona, content vs form , possibilities vs reality.
Can someone roughly explain how Western countries became capitalist? I understand that it has something to do with land seizure/settler-colonialism, war/imperialism.  But it seems that something is missing, because countries have had war, land occupation for as long as humans have existed, yet not all of them evolved into capitalistic societies (at least not until European contact).  I would appreciate if someone could provide some key factors/conditions for the existence of capitalism.
how should individual communists allocate their resources? age old question, im sure, and i don't expect there to be one easy answer to this question. But i am wondering if it is better to distribute (extra, excess, or inherited) funds to the masses in order to keep people alive under our current system, or use resources to organize, spread information, build infrastructure, and prepare for revolution?   I would also greatly appreciate any recommendations of where to send my money, thank you.

Communist parties gaining momentum? As of currently, workers are on strike in the U.S., the UK, France and so on. A lot of workers are rising up and realizing their interests as a working class.  But how come the Communist parties are not able to catch on to the winds of resistance? I feel like communist parties are still very mariginalized in politics. Sure, I see more MLs and so on on tiktok and stuff, but I rarely see actual communist parties rising or taking up any space. It worries me. Because obviously a lot of workers will be fooled into ideals of poverty by the Social democratics like Bernie Sanders, Labour and so on and so on.  If I am wrong however, and you do see parties gaining momentum, let me know! Would love to learn more and hear about it. Would be good for my peace of mind
How do Marxists critically think? Critical thinking is a buzzword in academia, but i do think its important skill to have.    so i guess my question is what is the Marxist view on critical thinking? How do we arrive at the truth? is the study and application of dialectical materialism the marxist version of critical thinking?
Does anyone have sources about voting not being compulsory in the U.S.S.R under Stalin? I've seen this affirmation a few times but no good sources so I want to know

Strength of the Red Army During Civil War Hello, I'm struggling to find reliable sources on the strength of the Red Army during the Russian Civil War. Specifically I would like to know the total number of men in the field in 1919, and how many of said total were infantry and cavalry and what how much equipment they had (tanks, guns, machine guns, planes, et cetera). If anyone could help me by finding websites detailing this stuff it'd be much appreciated, thanks.

Why is private property the result of estranged labor and not the other way around?  Is it because labor is what produces the property’s value and even the property itself? Or maybe because without estranged labor there would be no private property because if the labor isn’t being estranged you can’t privatize the property because it’s collectivized? I’m reading The Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844 and trying to wrap my head around that concept.
Best books for developing a solid, working understanding of imperialism and neo-colonialism Hi there. Recently, I've been trying to take a deep dive into understanding imperialism. I usually find theory harder to read, though I do get through it, but I mostly extensively read history books. I've read quite a bit about the subject and these historical, case study accounts, like, for example, *Kill Anything That Moves* and *The Jakarta Method* have got me wanting to really see the bigger picture. I'm about to start *Imperialism* by Lenin, which I have been putting off forever, and after that will read *Neo-Colonialism* by Nkrumah. I find it easier to grasp theoretical texts when I am also reading history at the same time where I can see how these theories play out in the real world, too. I want to understand the actual machinations of the global imperialist/neocolonialist system, from the perspective of international economics, like US dollar dominance, the lack of monetary policy flexibility in the Eurozone, and SWIFT/unilateral sanctions. But I also want to know how these things really tie in and, if it is fair to say, prove Marxist theories of imperialism. I hear other Marxists talk about finance capital and conquest of markets, yet I feel like I do not understand how these things function. Maybe I am overcomplicating it in my head.   Anyways, I would truly appreciate some good book recommendations on this topic. Articles are good, too. I feel like we have imperialism on a micro level, like a US private fighting in Vietnam, on a middle level, like a US-backed coup or sanctions against a specific nation, specific interventions, like in Haiti, and then on a macro level, which is the theory of imperialism, unequal development, as a whole. I want to better grasp how these all link together as part of one whole global imperialist menace. I bring up Haiti because, from what I have read about its history, I feel Haiti is a sadly very clear example of neo-colonialism in the world today. Super fascinating history, too, so I would also appreciate a book recommendation specifically about the history of Haiti. (I am more interested in how France and US managed to strangle Haiti's autonomy in its crib after the fact rather than the military history of the revolution itself.) Thanks.

Did the YouTube channel Red Circle, for leftist audiobooks, get taken down? Has it moved somewhere else? Please tell me it isn't gone. Do y'all know this channel? It was up until very recently, but now I cannot find any of the content on YouTube. The channel posted a very wide array of leftist audiobooks, but especially focused on historical non-fiction. It had really high quality recordings of *The Jakarta Method*, *How Europe Underdeveloped Africa*, *Adults In The Room*, and similar texts. I was looking for the videos of *Adults In The Room* in order to start listening to it today and noticed it all appears to be gone. Does anyone have any info on what happened?

how to Organize I live in semi-rural Kentucky, with no leftist organizations in the area that I'm aware of. how would I go about finding people amenable to socialism/communism?   I have contemplated going door to door and/or posting fliers at the library.   the first isn't exactly ideal, and I don't wanna get shot. the second is a little more attractive, but I don't know if it would be very effective.  any advice or resources would be helpful! have a wonderful day
How to organize like the right ?   18 year-old BIPOC Marxist. I’m tired of cowering in fear , as the world descents into a madness driven catacomb. I’m tired of seeing the far-right mobilize, and recruit those in my age group who are lost and petrified of the future. Why doesn’t the left have the same effect ? What must be done to resolve this ? I’m tired of speculation, or YouTube debates, I want action. I want to know what I could do in the immediate moment to mobilize others to the cause of uprooting capitalism and making the world safer for the disenfranchised.
What are your thoughts on the “Online Left”? Does anyone feel that there is an Online Left or that they may be a part of some Online Left? I’ve been on Leftist reddit, Tik Tok, as well as watching leftist YouTubers and streamers for awhile now and I’ve noticed that there’s a lot of talk about the Online Left. It got me wondering about an “Online Left.” I know that there are a lot of things that normies and even leftists who aren’t online wouldn’t know about, like creators or slang and stuff like that. So does that then mean that the Online Left is its own distinct community or is it a distinct part of something else, like the broader left? I think knowing the slang, lore, creators, internal jokes, and stuff like that could have something to do with it. But I’m wondering what everyone else thinks. Do you guys think that there is a distinct online left community? Or do you feel that you are part of an online leftist community?

Struggle Sessions has been transformed to a personal project for one of the 'survivors' of the CR-CPUSA. From the new StS home page:  >I have made some aesthetic changes to reinforce the fact that this is not a resurrection of Struggle Sessions but an anti-obituary. I have also re-uploaded all the old articles (everything that was made ‘private’ but not deleted from the WordPress, including the ones that Dallas-Kavga-Cathal took down after a spat with the editors he installed to run his blog) in response to some criticism and discussion of my decision to remove them all; these and any newly uploaded cult-documents can all be found in the ‘Dogma’ section. All posts originating from the anti-cult movement will be filed in the ‘Rebellion’ section.  >I’ll try to make this look nice later but I don’t really care right now. This is a personal project of an individual survivor of the Dallas-Cult who is not affiliated with any ‘Maoist’ organizations. This is part of my healing process – I just hope it can help others also.  >I’ve added ads and a donation button to the website. Any raised money will be used to keep the site running, to support victims/survivors of the CR-CPUSA, and maybe to help me pay for the copious amounts of therapy I need after dealing with Struggle Sessions for the last two years. 🤯  Thoughts?
Q&A Article with Official in Russian Communist Party (Q's on War in Ukraine, Political Repression, etc) [https://towardfreedom.org/story/archives/europe/only-complete-military-defeat-of-ukraine-is-resolution-qa-with-russian-communist-leader-on-ukraine-russia-china-more/](https://towardfreedom.org/story/archives/europe/only-complete-military-defeat-of-ukraine-is-resolution-qa-with-russian-communist-leader-on-ukraine-russia-china-more/)  I found this article extremely interesting.  It's a Q&A with the First Secretary of the St. Petersburg branch of the Russian Communist Party.    In terms of their position on the Ukraine war, he states it is founded in an opposition to fascism, and he sees Ukraine as completely controlled by the West.  He talks a lot about solidarity with and communication with other communist parties around the world.  Another interesting aspect is he talks about the political repression of the Russian Communist Party, and how they are very well aware that United Russia stole seats from them (a position supported by the mainstream news sources).  He talks about how their support is rooted in economic policies, such as fighting the retirement cuts imposed by United Russia.  they oppose the imprisonment of protesters, and are for less political repression in general.  He says that despite how popular they get, he is skeptical that the communist party in Russia will regain control of the country through elections.  I'm pasting some interesting portions below:  \-*--****RK:*** *We are the second \[largest\] party in the  Parliament. We are the biggest opposition party. As to the accusations  of being revisionist, we put it into our program that we use the  “creative development of Marxism-Leninism,” because Marxism-Leninism is  not a dogma. But of course, think I’m not a revisionist. I cannot admit  that I’m revisionist. I will never be revisionist. (Laughs) I have been a  party member for 21 years already, and I am relatively young.*  ***FC:*** *How old are you?*  ***RK:*** *I’m 40. It’s not a party of old people. Of  course, we have many old party members who were members of the Communist  Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). But those people who vote for our  party are not the people of that age. We are supported mostly by people  between \[ages\] 30 and 50. And the elderly, they vote for Putin’s party.*  ***FC:*** *How has the Party attempted to reach a post-Soviet generation?*  ***RK:*** *We’re just addressing the common problems,  because the problems of both younger generations and other generations  are very common in Russia. We are talking about social problems and we  are proposing our methods to fix the situation. Our measures.*  \--  ***FC:*** *What’s the relationship of the party to the Communist Party of China (CPC)?*  ***RK:*** *We have quite close contacts. We have \[a\]  cooperation agreement. We sign it every five years, to extend it for  five years. We exchange delegations on a regular basis, and we have  cooperation in the scientific aspects of studying Marxism-Leninism, as  well. So we are quite closely connected.*  ***FC:*** *So maybe more closely connected with the CPC now than the CPSU was to the CPC was after the \[1960 ideological\] split?*  ***RK:*** *Yes, we are more closely connected. Of course.*  *--*  ***FC:*** *What is the official party position on Stalin?*  ***RK:*** *We have never made any specific decision, or  there is no written decision. We’re saying, of course, Stalin did a lot  for the country, for the people. But, of course, they were violations of  socialist law during this period. So that’s how we evaluate it,  officially. And then internally, there are other positions, of course.  There are many who would say Stalin is better than Lenin, but then a few  who are anti-Stalin.*  ***FC:*** *But no Trotskyists?*  ***RK:*** *(laughs) Of course not.*  ***FC:*** *Who do you think was most the most destructive of the Soviet leaders, most responsible for the deterioration of the USSR?*  ***RK:*** *Khrushchev.*

Labor Aristocrat Apologist Rule? I feel like this sub somewhat lacks a rule similar to rule 8 but focused on the countless Labor Aristocrats trying to argue against Lenin's theory of Imperialism through their half baked interpretation of the labor theory of value in the First-World. This leads to many blatantly false answers to newcomers questions, especially on the 101 sub, which in my opinion are left up far too long until they finally say something more blatantly fascist. This can really mislead some people. What do you think?
Why did Mao apologize to Yugoslav delegates and denounce Stalin? According to [this article by OtherAspect](https://otheraspect.org/2015/08/11/mao-apologised-to-yugoslavian-delegates-told-stalin-blocked-our-revolution/) (sourced from this [archive on wilsoncenter.org](https://digitalarchive.wilsoncenter.org/document/minutes-maos-conversation-yugoslavian-communist-union-delegation-beijing-undated)) Mao apologized to Yugoslavian delegates and said he "let them down". The "apology" is written in an extreme anti-marxist manner, it shamelessly denounces Stalin to the point of looking forged. Some of the worst quotes are:  &#x200B;  >You wholeheartedly support Khrushchev’s  campaign to criticize Stalin, but we cannot do the same because our  people would dislike it  &#x200B;  >Stalin made you suffer and hence, justice is on your side  &#x200B;  >We are sorry that we hurt you before, thus owing you a good deal  &#x200B;  >Before I met with Stalin, I did not have  much good feeling about him.  I disliked reading his works, and I have  read only “On the Basis of Leninism,” a long article criticizing  Trotsky, and “Be Carried Away by Success,” etc.  I disliked even more  his articles on the Chinese revolution.  He was very different from  Lenin: Lenin shared his heart with others and treated others as equals  whereas Stalin liked to stand above every one else and order others  around.  This style can be detected from his works.  After I met with  him, I became even more disgusted:  I quarreled a lot with him in  Moscow.  Stalin was excitable by temperament.  When he became agitated,  he would spell out nasty things.  &#x200B;  >During \[Stalin’s\] time people’s minds  were so tightly controlled that even the feudalist control had been  surpassed.  While some enlightened feudal lords or emperors would accept  criticism, \[Stalin\] would tolerate none  &#x200B;  >Few people in China have ever openly  criticized me.  The \[Chinese\] people are tolerant of my shortcomings and  mistakes.  It is because we always want to serve the people and do good  things for the people.  Although we sometimes also suffer from bossism  and bureaucracy, the people believe that we have done more good things  than bad ones and, as a result, they praise us more than criticize us.   Consequently, an idol is created: when some people criticize me, others  would oppose them and accuse them of disrespecting the leader.   Everyday I and other comrades of the central leadership receive some  three hundred letters, some of which are critical of us.  These letters,  however, are either not signed or signed with a false name.  The  authors are not afraid that we would suppress them, but they are afraid  that others around them would make them suffer.  &#x200B;  >Khrushchev already corrected the mistake concerning Yugoslavia  &#x200B;  >We socialist countries must find \[better\]  solutions.  Certainly, we need concentration and unification;  otherwise, uniformity cannot be maintained  &#x200B;  >Only after the dissolution of the Comintern did we start to enjoy more freedom  &#x200B;  These lines strike me as extremely uncharacteristic and extremely revisionist and opportunistic, one could say Mao's late writings were incorrect (such as his Theory of Three Worlds) but this dates back to 1956.  I don't mean this post in any ill-intended manner, but this is quite a shock.
Anyone know the first accusations of NATO war crimes? Currently writing an essay on the idea of NATO (and America)'s sheer interests of neoliberalism and destroying true democracy (ex. Guatemalan Coup, 1954). I was inspired by The Making of an Atlantic Ruling Class (Kees van der Pijl).  I'm aware of accusations of war crimes in Libya, Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, and Bosnia but most texts I've read only regard those operations, the earliest I can find 1994. Is anyone aware of some earlier accusations of war crimes/complicity in acts in other operations? Thanks
Reading recommendations for KGB methods and tactics Since security culture is such a thing in our movement I thought it would be a good idea to brush up on counterintelligence reading. All I can find is some report by NATO, a bunch of spy novels or BS propaganda about how “evil” the KGB is. I’ll also take some Chinese spy text if you’ve got anything worth reading. Thanks comrades.

Has anyone read either of these two books? Would anyone here recommend them? Hi. I am looking for some opinions from here on two very unrelated books: *Imagining the Balkans* by Maria Todorova and *Hamas: A Beginner's Guide* by Khaled Hroub. Has anyone read either or both of these and, if so, what did you think? Thanks.

What communist literature you read? Its commonly to see comunists around the world only read eurocentric autors. But have you ever read anything outside eurozone? Like Sankara, Florestan Fernandes, something about the Grenade revolution. Anything outside Europe.
Life-Work-Praxis Balance? How do yous find a balance? How often do you do praxis and what do you do for praxis?  I’ve done small things that I guess are praxis  such as taking down white supremacist propaganda stickers, informing other people (mostly coworkers) about socialist ideas, and volunteering in a church’s soup kitchen.   However, these things don’t amount to much. I’d like to do more, and I have some ideas, but of course socialism is all about solidarity with other working class people. One issue with this is I am likely autistic and people are not wont to listen to me, much less form a relationship of any kind with me.   This autism, combined with my mental illness and life under capitalism, often saps me of energy (not to mention time). How do I combat this?   I have managed to form a friend group that is certainly progressive though not radical, and so this is a good step: maybe they can help me if I give them the right information, but they’re also the typically cynically young people that see little future beyond capitalism (despite the information I’ve given them). How does one go about forming say a chapter or reading group under these circumstances?

Thoughts on the assassination of Maurice Bishop in Grenada in 1983? I am researching the Grenada Revolution (1979-1983) and trying to understand what happened in October 1983. The M-L revolutionary leader of the People's Revolutionary Government (PRG), Maurice Bishop, was deposed by deputy Prime Minister & Marxist Bernard Coard and later assassinated by PRG General Hudson Austin. This turbulence was the excuse the US empire needed to invade Grenada and reestablish bourgeois dictatorship.   Explanations about this counterrevolution are hard to come by. According to Tim Wheeler, "The PRG government was overthrown by an ultra-left faction described by Fidel Castro as a “Pol Pot” cult..." (1)   Does anybody have insight on what actually happened?  Maurice Bishop was incredibly popular, so an attempt to dispose of him from the left is tactically unsound.

The Allied Forces knew about the Holocaust during the WWII In Losurdo's book on Stalin, he advances this thesis that the center of imperialism was perfectly aware of anti-semitism as a central policy of the Nazi party, including that the USSR even contacted the United Kingdom about this and that it was known that Churchill expected a Nazi invasion in USSR to crush Bolshevism. But with Stalin's movement of the Molotov-ribbentrop pact they began to rise and Britain had to act.  We also now know, due to the opening of World War II and Holocaust archives, that the United States and its allies suppressed evidence against Nazi war criminals implicated in the death camps in order to focus on fomenting anti-Communist sentiments in Germany. It is not surprising that they entered the war late.

Question regarding the USSR post Stalin Would Khrushchev's revisionism be able to be seen as a move away from socialism towards a more Fascist way of running things? With Gorbachev's move towards a market system favoring capitalist intrests being the icing on the cake. I see a lot of people making the argument that Stalin broke Lenin's dream of a socialist Russia in favour of some vague nationalism or even fascism. I personally think that this is entirely wrong and paints Stalin as something which he was not. Though I do think that making the same argument for the Khrushchev-Brezhnev-Gorbachev line of revisionism would be sort of reasonable. Thoughts?

is anyone worried about the destruction on human life after the collapse of a hegomonic USA Capitalism brings? We all know it, a big Big recession is coming, its effect are only delayed. many countries turn to fascism and many countries, mostly the global south, will embrace communism, as we see it in Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela.     Maybe this will be a opportunity for a multipolar world to exist, Capitalism decay brings fascism and war, the only reason Russia is again an imprelist power was because of their early capitalist collapse, Italy, Sweden, France, USA, It's seem the global north is moving towards fascism and the global south towards communism, I Really hope the colonised world win this time, or it will be the end of humanity for us.   I'm excited and hopeful about this transition from a unipolar world to a multipolar one, but with this transition comes a great loss of human suffering, I really hops there will be no mass starvation again, I really hope that we will go through this without ending our species, but my hope is draining everyday.

Late stage capitalism or capitalism decay? Some communist say the US is in late stage capitalism or capitalism decay now and some say the US still has some time to save it self from its destruction but time is running out.  The cite of data they are saying is the US has major monopolies now citing the monopoly problems, the middle class is destroyed well started dying in the late 80s and more noticeable in the late 90s, now it gone, massive homeless problem worse than Mexico, large government debt in the trillions, about 8% or 4% own all of the US wealth, wars after wars, massive prison population, high inflation, the only true middle class are the aging baby boomers as the middle class of the gold age of the 50s to early 80s are gone, large unemployment, government corruption, factories going to China, Taiwan and India.   My questions are why are government so corrupted in late stage capitalism or capitalism decay? How bad is the monopolies now and wealth Concentration now in the US? Why did the US deindustrialize? Power, greed, money or corruption?  How can county with highest GDP in the world and most religious first world country allow this to happen? Did greed, power or money corrupted the government?  Is this part of late stage capitalism or capitalism decay phenomenon?

Is it right to make money with capitalism to fund its downfall? Considering it will likely cost a good amount to fund the programs, rallies, policies, etc. that will be necessary to not only sway more individuals but to help remove capitalism itself, would it be right to make money with the system?    As in, use capitalism (business, stocks, etc.) to build a lot of money, and use that money to fund what’s needed. Would it be morally/ethically right to do that, considering that it usually hurts the workers beneath you to get that much money?   I’m aware that those who reach that point of wealth typically wouldn’t just get rid of their money making, just a hypothetical.

New teacher looking for reading recommendations for myself and students (high school English) Hi everyone! I am a relatively new teacher as well as a bit of a baby communist. I have identified as a leftist for most of my life but over the past year as I’ve tried to educate myself more I feel confident calling myself a communist. What I am struggling with at the moment is knowing that schools often (if not all of the time :() do more harm than good. I became a teacher because of my own love of reading and learning and want to share that, but as I develop in the profession I want to be someone who is actively involved in school reform. I plan on attending my first union meeting next week as I was just hired by a big board for the first time, but what can I be doing everyday as a teacher to make school a better place for my students that encourages critical and anti capitalist thinking, while also working in a largely conservative canadian city? Last year I was fortunate enough to be teaching middle school social studies and often found opportunities to demonstrate to students that capitalism does not benefit the working class but I’m not sure how to achieve this with grade 10 and 11 English. Any advice or reading recommendations for myself and my students is highly appreciated!

US pledges to “go on the offensive” against Russia
How did religion get turn into stage acting in most countries but more so the US and being so far right? Yet the Bible is more inline with communism Many people say the problems with government or society is people are turning away from God and the growing of atheist?  And go on to say the reason there is large homeless population, poverty, monopolies, corporate greed, corruption, offshoring to China , deindustrialization and the empire is falling is people are turning away from God and growing of atheist?   But this not not explain why the most religious country in the world in first world countries is worst country in world with businesses monopolies, homeless population, wars, more wars and more wars, corporate greed, corruption in government and corruption in businesses, highest prison population in world, offshoring factories to China , deindustrialization, AI and automation with more workers out of work. The richest country the highest GDP and worst covid response for wave one and wave two and wave three of covid, higher tent city population than even in places in Mexico and Brazil now.  Yet the US is the most religious country per first world country in the world. In the midwest and south it almost guaranteed your co workers knows what church you go to and the topic of religion is talk about like chit chat.  In Oklahoma has many AM and FM talk radio stations and billboards showing the religion is part of the culture.  Yet religious people claim the government is turning away from God and is atheist is reason. If that was true the US should be best country per first world country and places like Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Greece should have the highest prison population per world ratio, highest homeless population than any first world country, highest poverty and worst government and businesses corruption and no free healthcare, longest work hours than any country in world so on.  Even if it is true like religious people claim the government is turning away from God and is atheist is the reason in the US it does not explain the past.    Well put simple you cannot be atheist and run for government in the US may be in New York and Los Angles but not in midwest or south. And this was very much so in the past even in liberal places like New York and Los Angles in past.  So this talk that religious people claim the government is turning away from God and is atheist is reason and they may well entertain the talk yes entertain the talk that Trump is saying he is religious but is really an atheist does mot explain the past when religion was even more think in the past.  When the likes of Ronald Reagan, Richard Nixon, Lyndon B. Johnson, Harry S. Truman and so on. All gone to church every weaken, have a bible in their bedroom, pray before eating and going to bed and going to church events so on. Yes all when religion was as even more deeply rooted in the culture in the past.  One can only summarize all political parties no matter the present or the past or far past is all an act that they say they are religious but are not religious just to get votes.  Other summarize is the church and Vatican is not really concern about evil and just want church membership otherwise lot of people would not be allowed to be in Church with out changing their action.  I know in the past some religious folks where turning to communism and anti capitalism but after China, USSR and North Korea being association of anti church and atheist they started to switch to conservatives.  And co opt started in the 30s I believe that the left was atheist and right was religious even with shifted of policy of parties.  Other thing that probably does not help is the break away from the Vatican the born again, pastor, minister and reverend that have different take on the Bible than the very strict Vatican that priest have to obey and that going to Church and believing in God is not enough to go Heaven. Is probably why conservatives are bit more left in first world countries out side of the US. But even the Vatican probably turns blind eye for Church membership and takes more liberal view. Well than why because if one look at the past it was not good even with religion more deeply rooted.  So what happen to religion that they became conservatives and pro capitalism where by the left was the opposite was it the 30s and 40s when China, USSR, and North Korea being association of anti church and atheist is when the co opt started that believe that the left was atheist and right and war started on left vs right on religion grounds.  Also what is the problem with the Vatican and very much so the born again, pastor, minister and reverend so on that turn religion into play acting now. I mean so bad that if God came down from the sky he would have to clean up the Vatican and places of worship first. What has happen that religion became so conservative and pro capitalism? And working class lost vey large group here of support.
Is Russia imperialist? | MR Online
Are inter-imperialist wars justified if they increase multipolarity? I notice there is a lot of sympathy in leftist circles for Russia in the Ukraine conflict, and for China in a hypothetical conflict regarding Taiwan. I have to conclude this is because many leftists want to see an end to U.S. hegemony and understand that success for Russia and China would tend to produce that result. But wouldn’t Lenin, Luxemburg, and other leading communists of their day say “no war but class war”? They were writing during World War I, an inter-imperialist conflict in a then-multipolar world. They didn’t believe that World War I was justified so long as it undermined, say, British hegemony. How can communists stand with Russia when Russia isn’t waging class struggle, and indeed has shown no interest in reviving the socialist project?
Is the state the locus of social antagonism? In *State and Revolution*, Lenin, citing Engels, describes how the operating capacity of any historical state exists as a result of antagonism and as a means of delaying an inevitable conflict between the haves and have-nots:  >A state arises, a special power is created, special bodies of armed men, and every revolution, by destroying the state apparatus, shows us the naked class struggle, clearly shows us how the ruling class strives to restore the special bodies of armed men which serve it, and how the oppressed class strives to create a new organization of this kind, capable of serving the exploited instead of the exploiters.  In the very next chapter, however, Lenin decries the bourgeois state as incapable of expressing the true will of the people and exposes the development of enfranchisement (in the U.S., for instance, as it pertains to formerly enslaved people) as a deceitful tactic which disguises the entrenchment of capitalism under a veil of putative democracy.   &#x200B;  How do you reconcile these ideas? If the working class doesn't have representation in government, how is the state still functioning as the place where competing powers ultimately contend and argue? To put it another way, Republicanism and Democratism are ideologies both defensive of capitalism and imperialism. Do anti-imperialists then have power in Congress? If not, how is the state actually the product of antagonism?

AERIAL BOMBING ON COUNTRY’S PEOPLE IS AN ACT OF GENOCIDE AERIAL BOMBING ON COUNTRY’S PEOPLE IS AN ACT OF GENOCIDE  12th Jan, 2023  Stop the Genocidal war with aerial bombing on ChhatisgarhTelangana Border !  On Wednesday, 11th Jan 2023, a joint operation was launched by Central Reserve Police Force, Greyhound and CoBRA (Elite Anti Naxal Squad), District Reserve Guard (comprising of Infamous  SPOs of Salwa Judum) in the wee hours. According to the varying news reports, the attempt is to target an armed Battalion of CPI (Maoist) headed by a top Naxal Commander. Some reports have clarified that the operation is aided by Helicopters, Drone and Global Positioning Data. The aim is to hit the TelanganaChhatisgarh-Odisha border region. It has come to our notice  that a widespread aerial bombing campaign has been undertaken to that end in Madkanguda, Mettaguda, Bottethong, Sakiler, Madpaaduled, Kannemerka, Pottemangum, Bottalanka, Raspalli and Erpad of Pamed and Kistaram blocks of South Bastar at Chhatisgarh-Telangana Border, from 11 am onwards. According to a recent media report, it was claimed that the drones, supposedly to be engaged in surveillance missions on the naxal movement, will be operated by the Indian Air Force personnel from the National Technical Research Organisation, which was set up with the aid of US  intelligence operatives of NSA, pointing to an all round offensive of State with the help of US  This is not the first time that aerial bombing campaign has been undertaken in these regions to “eliminate the Maoists”. Last 2 years have seen aerial bombings in April of Year 2021 and  2022. Various villages bombed this time, have previously been bombed in above mentioned drone attacks of 2021 and 2022.It is dangerous that aerial attacks and all out war is unleashed on  the people in the name of countering the Maoist movement or Naxalites, which had, until now been considered a socioeconomic and political question that requires political attention not military intervention. Regardless, the use of Aerial Attacks,  Armed Forces and Air Force on the domestic soil in an ‘internal conflict’ of the country is in violation of various international conventions and charters and amounts to war crimes. It is very important to understand that these very regions of Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Telangana, Maharashtra are rich in minerals worth billions of dollars and the US along with other imperialist powers and help from their Indian lackeys like Jindal, Tata, Adani and  Ambani, are desiring to have unhindered control on the same. For this very reason of extraction, a political question of resource and land, has been rampantly turned into a matter of military intervention, similar to the lines of various Latin American countries where US imperialism has plundered.  It is also very important to understand that the intensification of Brahmanical Hindutva Fascism is an important tool to aid the loot and plunder of land and resources of the people of our country  and militarization plays a very important role in such onslaught. Under Fascism, socio-economic and political questions become a matter of military interventions and continuation of an intensified genocidal war against the people for plunder of  resources are termed as “pro-development”. This exponential intensification of military campaigns and trampling of very basic human rights, is also an attempt by the Fascist forces to test the extent of our deafening silence and this onslaught is bound to increase at the very pace, if not opposed unitedly. At this hour of Brute militarization and Genocidal Military repression, Forum Against Corporatization and Militarization calls upon all the democratic, Conscious, justice and peace loving people of the country to unitedly oppose the military repression on people of our own country and demand the Indian state to address the socio-economic and political questions as such, through talks and deliberations.  Forum also condemns in the most harsh tone possible, this rampant use of aerial strikes and genocide against the people of the country and demand the following:  1. Immediately stop aerial bombings in ChhattisgarhTelangana Border and else where, on the people of our own country.  2. Immediately withdraw the troops from ChhattisgarhTelangana border engaged in Genocidal operation.  3. Indian government must engage in political discourse with the CPI (Maoist)  4. Stop the loot of resources by imperialist backed mining giants. 5. Stop Operation SAMADHAN-PRAHAR.  FORUM AGAINST CORPORATIZATION AND  MILITARIZATION (FACAM), NEW DELHI
How is Capitalism the Root of Corruption? In my hometown of Naples, corruption runs rampant. Rich families are able to control the government with money, and the poor have no say whatsoever.

A Marxist critique of I-O Psychology? To me, Industrial and Organizational Psychology, aka Occupational Psychology, is inherently pro capitalist as it ultimately is involved with businesses and profits.  Besides, all that bs employers implement on their hiring and selection processes, the pointless tests, the H.R. department itself, all of that come from this pseudo field of psychology, they are just extra obstacles for the proletariat to make a living.  If anyone agrees or knows more about it, I would like to read more insightful and well researched works on this topic.
CPP Statement On the Occasion of the Announced Formation of the International Communist League
Practical books I’ve just been reading that Mark Fisher thread and several people commented that although his observations are very astute, he doesn’t address anything practical, failing to offer any insight into ‘what to do’.   Admittedly I do love his work, but I’ve been sucked into a theory spiral recently and it can become deflating very quickly.  “Don't wear them glasses too long. Starts to feel like a knife turnin' in your skull.” Comes to mind.   I’m just reaching out to see if anyone has any recommendations of texts which are a little more practical or dare I say… optimistic?!   Thanks guys  ETA: huge thanks to all in the comments for some great recommendations, really appreciate it
I want to learn more about the inner lives of capitalists - what they desire and why These questions have been bugging me for a while and I don't know how to begin to answer them: Why do capitalists desire to make more and more money, to keep expanding their power without limit? Key word, *desire*. I understand that corporations must grow or die. But why do super-rich capitalists *care*? Why don't they just sell their stock and move to Hawaii? Also, how are they able to avert their eyes from the exploitation of people and nature? How do they sleep at night?  &#x200B;  I can think of some basic answers. Some people enjoy the accumulation of money and power for its own sake, and some enjoy the challenge of staying on top once you've gotten there. But I'd like to go much more deeply into this subject, into the inner life of capitalists. What do they desire, what causes them fear and pain, and why?  &#x200B;  Books, videos, blog posts, or just your own two cents -- all recommendations are welcome.

Should I try creating my own local groups?  P.S. New reddit account so that I can be careful about anonymity.
Some great Docs on Cuba, Che, and Castro. I just made a couple long comments regarding these Docs, but after reading more comments decided to post these here for more people to see. My family is from Cuba and I was raised on even more lies about Cuba than most Americans, so I was particularly moved by these movies. They are not perfect and I’m sure some will claim they are not “unbiased” enough, I disagree. I implore you to step away from your preconceived notions on Cuba and give these Docs a watch with an open mind.   “Fidel” (2001)  https://youtu.be/P2Obp6YS4SY (1:31:41)   “Cuba: Defending Socialism, Resisting Imperialism” (2010) https://youtu.be/xxFPZaurHZA (46:06)  “Che, Un hombre Nuevo” (2010)  https://vimeo.com/363347022 (2:08:58)  I have to say that they are all fantastic, but the last one on Che is seriously beautiful. If you have doubts about Che and Fidel just try to listen to them in their own words, both him and Fidel speak in a way you would find surprising if you were raised on American lies.  I add this non-communist source for the likely  “but Che was a racists homophobic murder” comments.  https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1lt4rb/was_it_the_truth_behind_the_critical_controversy/  Cuba (and USSR) obviously had a bad history with LGBTQ rights but IMO any Marxist should be able to look at the material conditions of the times and understand that while inexcusable today, it does not negate the good done by these revolutionaries. Castro may not have admitted he was wrong until he was very old but he did anyways, something I don’t think many old people are ever able to do.
Rent-seeking behavior, Technology, and Superprofits Marx explained that the profit rate in the price of a commodity is equal to the surplus value divided by capital (which includes labor costs, other variable capital, and constant capital).  Marx goes on to say that if  an individual capitalist discovers a technique that reduces costs, then if he still sells his product at the prevailing price, he will get a super-profit. At least until the rest of the capitalists in that industry catch  on and implement the new technique.  Instead of technical  innovation, what are some examples of capitalists artificially increasing the costs for competing capitalists? For example, bribing the  government to:  &#x200B;  * pass regulations that make production more expensive for competitors * grant oligopoly/monopoly powers * et cetera  &#x200B;  So instead of DECREASING costs for himself, he INCREASES costs for the competitor. Would this have the same effect as technical innovation?  Furthermore,  in Capital volume III, chapter 15 Marx says that, in the long run, technical innovation causes the overall rate of profit to fall.  My question is, would hamstringing competitors in any of the above ways also cause the rate of profit to fall? Why or why not?
China’s abandonment of Zero-COVID and imperialist hypocrisy
Books on Chinese Civil War? Are there any good, detailed (a few hundred pages long) non-biased books on China's Civil War? Many of the books I'm finding are either biased or not detailed/long enough.
What are the alternatives to Newspapers on the Internet? Parties with newspapers feel anachronistic in the First World, not just because of their politice, but because they hold on to physical newspapers to deliver their message.  Is the internet any better? I've heard people suggest YouTube videos, Podcasts and Websites but honestly I don't think working people read or watch any of these outlets. In the net, everyone gets funnelled into watching and reading certain things based on an algorithm, and the needs of Google, Facebook, ads, etc. Of course the class background of the user matters in what they search out. But now smartphones are increasingly accessible even in Third World countries, how should information be communicated?  Its worth mentioning the only people in the First World still using print media almost exclusively nowadays are prisoners.

Overcoming Trauma When Organizing?  This is unorthodox for this sub but maybe there will be some helpful answers here.  I've recently been out of an abusive relationship (this was separate from my organizing, this isn't some DSA "dating your comrades" kinda deal) and its been giving me dangerous intrusive thoughts. It's impacting my organizing work and I've had to stop because I felt like deadweight. The people in my social circle give me the same advice, that it's not my fault and I need to go into therapy. I'm hesitant to go into therapy, since it costs money and I'm not sure if their advice will be useful, I've heard a lot of bad experiences about people and their therapists.  Are there any communist approaches to dealing with mental health? Or do I just have to try to make the best out of what coping methods liberal psychology has to offer? Is this just a matter of waiting until time heals my wounds? I've kept the info vague because I felt a very personal info dump would be inappropriate  Edit: Really wish I could change titles because this makes it sound like organizing made me traumatized

'When I give food to the poor, they call me a saint. When I ask why the poor have no food, they call me a communist." - Bishop Helder Camara
An old poem Written in 1922 by Kostas Varnalis. Dedicated to lenin and the communist movement in general. Original version in greek, translated to english by me. You can figure out the rest.  I am not the seed of luck the maker of the new life I am a child of necessity and a mature child of Rage.  I do not descend from the clouds For no one sent me Father, supposedly consolation for you, slave, in pain.  Heavenly powers, angels, lilies, birds and chanting nothing! I'm the one who's supported By your flaming hearts  I am the mermaid of the ship In the ship that sails straight forward Powerful waves strike on me and the weather is volent against me.  Listen, how the winds are taking the voice of a thousand years! Inside my voice all mankind feels pain  Oh, how the winds take it And how we cry afterwards Black abysses, black tombs Rivers full and thick  In my mind and in my heart The shames if centuries have been stirred up And my arm is armed with flaming lightningbolts  I am not one, but thousands! Not only the living and the dead follow me in a dark line.  But all those who are unborn, thousands who still curse me and all touch their swords upon me and bend them.  I give no words of comfort I give a knife to all as I thrust it into the earth It becomes light, it becomes consciousness   Everywhere it passes, it shatters like the north wind, like the south wind. all the deadly empires founded on falsehood.  And one he upholds and resurrects the kingdom of labor (Peace! Peace!) the kingdom of panhuman friendship
Term for imperial co-optation of radical politics? **Trying to remember the term for:**  when the state co-opts social movements or their figures, castrating their politics into pacifism to curdle the power of those movements and convince the people that involvement in them would consist of, say, stickers on a car, voting, saying you care, etc  (This process especially occurs once it becomes mainstream popular to affiliate with those movements, i.e. the way it has in the US since the 2010s)  Is this a Fanon thing? Cornel West? Let me know

The advantages of Soviet/Eastern European/Communist style apartment blocks Soviet style apartment blocks are often viewed as "dystopian" or "gloomy" by society, but what are some of the advantages these apartment blocks present in a community in terms of urban planning, housing infrastructure, ergonomics, etc?   I am planning on doing a speech about its advantages and I need to gain some insights about it. I don't know if this subreddit is the right place to ask this but I am open to any comments and suggestions. Thanks!

On the Initiative for Building a New International Organization/Forum of Maoists I would like to share a document written by Proletarian Party of East Bengal (PBSP) on the question of establishing an international organisation of Maoist parties [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Eaj3FpRxvxKcOhcwB4tEvzZz1L9K2WZJ/view?usp=share\_link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Eaj3FpRxvxKcOhcwB4tEvzZz1L9K2WZJ/view?usp=share_link)  As some of you may know, recently some Maoist parties and groups founded an 'International Communist League' [https://ci-ic.org/](https://ci-ic.org/) Not everyone decided to join, however.  There was another initiative by CPI (Maoist) on establishing an international Maoist forum [https://www.tkpml.com/en/cpi-maoist-central-committee-long-live-red-may-day/](https://www.tkpml.com/en/cpi-maoist-central-committee-long-live-red-may-day/) What PBSP had written seems to me to be more in line with this proposal and not what ICL had declared.  The document by PBSP also provides a good analysis of international situation. I compared it to ICL declaration and I believe that PBSP understands that there is a period of inter-imperialist rivalry when Russia and China challenge US hegemony, while ICL still holds the view that US is the sole superpower and it is the most aggressive one.         Recently, due to the emergence of US rival China and multiple crises in the US empire, the US-led unipolar world has broken down. The conflict between China-Russia and the US bloc over world supremacy has intensified. Due to the crisis of the US-led NATO alliance, the social imperialist China has now openly declared its share in the world division and has expressed the hope of conquering the world within 2050. Russia has also already developed good relations with China. And it is trying to rebuild its empire and recapture the countries it lost in Europe, daring to launch military aggression if necessary. Russia's invasion of Ukraine is a reflection of the Russian-US inter-imperialist conflict.           Xi Jingping's re-election as General Secretary at the recent 20th Congress also aims to challenge the US-led imperialist world order and to establish China as the world's number one superpower.          This new global situation is creating a multilateral world that will undermine the onesided unstoppable monopolistic hegemony. Both the countries began world trade primarily with the Russian ruble and the Chinese Yuan as alternatives to the dollar, with the aim to break the monopoly of the US dollar. Many countries of the world, including Europe, are dependent on Russian wheat and oil and gas. Meanwhile, Hungary, Italy and Germany are buying Russian oil and gas in rubles in defiance of the US sanction. Saudi Arabia bypassed the US to sell oil to China in Chinese currency. The war in Ukraine has plunged the entire world into a crisis.  Compare this to ICL analysis:          The United States currently bears the condition of sole hegemonic superpower. After the disintegration of the social-imperialist USSR in 1991, the economic weight of imperialist Russia was reduced and so did their military power, but it still maintains its character of atomic superpower. In turn, the other imperialist powers, like Germany, England, France, Japan, China, Austria, the Netherlands, Australia, Sweden, Canada, Italy, Spain, etc., altogether are also a handful of oppressing countries. Since the decade of 1990, they are contending for a new repartition of the oppressed countries that were subjected to social-imperialist USSR. Since then, all the events of some relevance - be them bellicose or non-bellicose - in Eastern Europe, in the former Soviet Republics of Central Asia, the so-called Amplified Middle East – the Persian Gulf, Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Northern Africa –, and in the Far East – North Korea –, in Southeastern Asia – Vietnam, Laos, Kampuchea – and in Latin America – Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela – are included in this contend for the new repartition of those countries. The current world situation is marked by the plan of Yankee imperialism to develop its war of aggression through blood and fire. Their main strategic objective is to snatch the condition of atomic superpower from Russia, hold down social-imperialist China and press it to widely open its economy. Alliances with other imperialist powers are used for that purpose - according to convenience - as with Germany, France, England, etc., to subvert the order in the spheres of influence that has a high strategic value for Russia and imposes economic sanctions as a threat to all imperialist powers. In turn, Russia makes efforts to maintain its spheres of influence, especially in Ukraine, Syria and Iran.
Curious about LGBTQ+ rights in the DPRK I saw a tweet today discussing LGBTQ+ rights in North Korea from a (non-confirmed) person that lived there and they explained that they never really used the umbrella term LGBTQ+ and whatnot and they just exist without people segregating against them just because it's so normalized. This got me wondering if it's possible to do gender reassignment in North Korea and how trans people in the DPRK are treated. If anyone has any sources or even some anecdotes about people that most of us would consider under that LGBTQ+ umbrella I'd be interested in reading them!

Spy Nation / Confession (자백) - Documentary about how South Korean intelligence tortures North Korean defectors into lying This documentary was referenced in the "Loyal Citizens of Pyongyang" video from a few years ago.  **Synopsis:**  *"Former Seoul civil servant Yoo Woo-sung has been arrested as a North Korean spy. However, the only clear evidence presented by the National Intelligence Service is his sister's "confession" testimony... Director Choi Seung-ho, who has doubts about the arrest by the state agency, which can be said to be the heart of South Korea, who has been fighting against the threat of the North, sets out with the news team. As the interview progresses, a colleague of the National Intelligence Service exposes the fabrication of documentary evidence and commits suicide. In October 2015, Yoo was declared "not guilty" by the Supreme Court. However, this was not the only spy fabrication case. After long-term follow-up coverage in South Korea, China, Japan, and Thailand, the film cuts into the deep darkness of spy fabrication by the center of state power that has continued uninterrupted for 40 years."*  This South Korean documentary just recently got translated into English, but it's copyrighted and not able to be posted on YouTube, so I'll provide links below. The subtitles are soft encoded into an .mkv file, so you'll need a program like VLC or MPC-HC to watch it and enable subtitles.

What do you think of PSL (The Party for Socialism and Liberation) in the US? I’ve been told this is one of the only ML parties in the US. It was founded in 2004. Here is the first few paragraphs of their most recent platform from 2019:   The Party for Socialism and Liberation exists to carry out the struggle for socialism inside the United States, the center of world capitalism and imperialism. The PSL stands in solidarity with our sisters and brothers around the world who are resisting capitalist exploitation and imperialist domination.  The need for the socialist reorganization of society becomes more apparent and urgent with each passing day. While a tiny part of the population grows ever richer, tens of millions of workers here in the United States and billions of workers around the world sink deeper into poverty. Monumental advances in science and technology, which could have uplifted the many, instead have mainly enriched the few.  The great wealth of society is the product of both natural resources and the labor of working people. Yet, that wealth is increasingly the private property of those who produce nothing of value — the tiny class of capitalist owners. This irreconcilable conflict defines life for the vast majority of people in the world.  As a very fresh ML I am looking for parties to join and this looked to be it, I’d like to know what y’all’s experiences have been if you’ve been a member or what you know about the party in general. I am still learning and would not be joining immediately as I think I need more knowledge to effectively organize, but I’d love to know if this is a good party once that time has come.
Do Belarusians miss the USSR?
Taking an Economics class as a Communist Good morning all,  I'm in college and have to take a Principles of Microeconomics class. I'm curious about how to view this class from a Marxist perspective. The econ book we're using supposes that scarcity is the reason for many of the world's problems in terms of access to healthcare, education, housing, etc... They are saying we just don't have enough to give everyone. Which is ridiculous. Many cities have more abandoned houses than homeless. And I know that the US produces more food than is actually consumed. Scarcity is manufactured by capitalists, no? I'm just looking for some advice from other communists who have taken an Econ class. How do I analyze this class from a Marxist perspective?  Thanks
most of the "arguments" I've encountered against communism (particularly the worst ones) seem to really boil down to a lack of/bad social analysis.  By which I mean two things: one being a lack or outright rejection of dialectics, and two being just overall bad attempts at analyzing history and its causes/effects.    This is really all experienced on kind of the worst end of the spectrum, but for example if you were to say something positive about the USSR or PRC, you can sometimes get "then you're saying you just want to send everyone to the gulags?!" Or so on and so forth.    I think it's fair to say we certainly don't want to repeat disastrous internal policies and actions (even though material conditions in the imperial core are significantly different than 1950s in China or 1910s in Russia), but for general opposition to communism (usually specifically people holding the anticommunist line), you can't have one thing without the other. I don't always respond to these 'objections', one reason being because the person in question is not always acting in good faith, another being that anything even vaguely 'Marxist' (whether actually or not) is automatically assumed to be evil even though I know they can't give a coherent definition for what that is supposed to be.    Anyways. I've only been socialist for about a year now, but I've had just about everything in the book thrown at me. This is my takeaway from conversations I've had, as well as reading a headache-inducing slew of poorly-written articles against socialism. Thoughts?
Good job I used to be a regular poster here when r/communism had about 30k subscribers. Now when I've returned after a few years it has more than 200k. This is really heartwarming. I think it is a sign that people everywhere are dissatisfied with capitalist system and are gradually turning to communism. So despite the darkness prevailing now and the world war looming on the horizon the new dawn is coming.  I will post some stuff soon. Was looking through the recent posts and found some disturbing trends on this sub, but overall, it is the same good old r/communism I will post about what disturbs me later.  Greetings from a Russian Maoist Party ([rusmaoparty.org](https://rusmaoparty.org)) and solidarity to you all, to Maoist comrades, ML comrades and communists from every country who visits this sub!

Ethical dilemma: communist lawyer? I am escaping a career in education to attend law school in the fall. Do you think it is possible to be a practicing American lawyer and stay true to communist beliefs simultaneously?  I have come to terms with being a public school teacher; I have been able to positively impact students and open their eyes to the realities of American life. But law...? Am I going to have to abandon my beliefs in service of the judicial system? I am feeling very conflicted.
Tudeh Party of Iran, Joint Declaration in solidarity with the struggle of Iranian people for peace, progress, and justice | Solidnet
How to support socialism in the Global South? I’m a former liberal and somewhat new to left-wing / anti-imperialist politics, living in the United States, and I’m curious for your thoughts on how a Western leftist can support revolutionary socialism in the Global South. U.S. sanctions make direct aid to comrades in Cuba, North Korea, and Venezuela (among others) basically impossible, and I imagine there are various laws around the world barring direct payments to foreign political parties.  Assuming it is easier for me to donate money than, for example, to fly to Peru and join the protests, what is the best way to financially support socialism in the Global South? Does anyone have thoughts on where resources should be focused at this time? Many thanks for your wisdom on this.  As an aside, I’m posting this while on vacation in Kerala, India—one of the only places in the capitalist world currently governed by communists.

On the Founding of the Communist Party of Aztlan
Reading Group? Hi, would anyone be interested in forming a reading group dedicated to Marxism? The one condition for me at the moment is that I would like to make our way through all of the major works of Marx before getting to anything else. We could begin with some of his predecessors (German idealism, classic economics, french socialism) if people really wanted to, but the initial goal would be to work through Marx. After that, we can get into Engels, M-L-M, Frankfurt School, Western Marxism, etc. If you are interested, please let me know!
Why do we disagree about China? Communists as far as I can tell just cannot agree on China. Im not naive enough to search for a definitive verdict on China here, but I'm curious if yall have an insight into what the different sources of information are that lead to, for example, some endorsing China's loans in Africa as mutually respectful and for the purposes of development etc... And others decrying it as a predatory debt trap identical to the IMF's. Alot of the debate seems to come down to whether or not the working class are still in control in China.   Context: I am considering joining the American Party of Labour, but their current stance on China is incongruent with analyses I see (often citing a wealth of sources) defending/explaining China's loan policy. Again, Im not looking for the answer, but more a short bibliography of these two schools of thought.

U.S. backed Peruvian dictatorship murders 9 demonstrators in Juliaca
Manifesto: Program for the refoundation of Chile Yesterday, January 7, 2023, the de facto communist party of Chile, the **Chilean Communist Party (Proletarian Action)** published its programmatic manifesto for the refoundation of Chile.  As a Party member I have decided to translate our *Manifesto* into English so that comrades around the world can read it and be informed of our path towards revolution and socialism. I will carry out this task gradually, step by step, beginning with the opening presentation of the book, written by our First Secretary, comrade Eduardo Artés Brichetti:  &#x200B;  **Manifesto**  **Program for the refoundation of Chile**  **For a patriotic, popular, anti-imperialist government with a socialist perspective**  &#x200B;  **Presentation**  The past and present history of our country is full of struggles of the workers and peoples of Chile.  Some of these struggles were memorable and formidable, in which the peoples and workers of our country showed great courage in trying to overcome social contradictions to achieve a dignified life, take their destiny into their own hands and fight for freedom (freedom as a country, freedom as a society, freedom as a social class, freedom as a people).  But only rarely in our history have we achieved significant successes. More often than not, our struggles have been drowned in blood. Assassinations, repression, detentions, torture, mutilations. This is our history. So too, very recently in 2019.  The recent experience of 2019 has demonstrated —in our judgment— the lack of direction, of a clear north, of a *defined political proposal* that could have guided the popular uprising, that would have allowed us to discuss a social perspective, that would have provided us with more clarity on what is to be done, and that would have delivered us the understanding that struggle is the only real path to a better life.  Do repeated defeats invalidate or negate the possibility of social change? We are convinced that this is not the case. The failure of the struggles is not due to the lack of courage of the vast majority of the country's population, but rather to the fact that unfortunately we have lacked an adequate policy to guide and direct the struggle of the workers and the peoples of Chile in an effective manner.  In our opinion, it is necessary, even vital, that the struggle of the vast majorities for their emancipation from the *exploitation and oppression* exercised over them by a small minority, has an *argument* and a *policy* elaborated through political debate within the working class and all the social sectors that share its destiny; that also has a vanguard that leads the revolutionary struggle with *transparency, honesty and coherence* and that has as its objective *the construction of a new society*.  Being clear about what kind of society we want is an essential condition for successful social struggle. We believe that, in accordance with the current phase of development of capitalism in Chile, we must advance towards the consolidation of a *government of a patriotic and popular character*, whose objective is to *make progress towards the construction of socialism*.  All these points are crucial. Without them, the struggle will be blind, going from one defeat to another.  For this reason, as the *Communist Party (Proletarian Action)* we have dedicated enormous efforts to draft this Manifesto that we deliver to you today.  This Manifesto is directed to the workers, to the small and medium-sized traders and industrialists, to the peoples of our country, to simple women and men, to young people and in general to all the oppressed, exploited and neglected sectors of Chile.  This Manifesto belongs to them.  Its objective is to formulate, in a constant process of feedback based on the debate around its content, the main ideas and tasks to be pursued by the vast majorities in the struggle for their emancipation; to provide the working class and all the social sectors that share its destiny with a path, an orientation, a platform for debate and a social perspective; to counter and combat the clearly counterrevolutionary, anti-popular, anti-democratic and anti-socialist postulates; and to be an instrument for the organic construction, political development and ideological strengthening of the vast majorities of our country.  It is very important that this Manifesto be a living element that sparks debates in the social and political organizations among the most advanced sectors of our class and receives feedback from such debate.  The existing social contradictions in our country are such that they cannot be circumvented by repression or lies, and the various forms of struggle of the vast majority against the exploiting minority will increase in quantity and quality.  The greatest contribution that this Manifesto can make is to contribute to the political understanding of the working class and the great popular masses ***about their role in history and the power they have*** to replace the current society with a better one, **because they are the ones called to build a new society.**  We believe that this Manifesto is of such importance and transcendence that it will help the struggle of the workers and peoples of Chile towards victory and will make history in their hands.  For a new country, for the refoundation of Chile!  &#x200B;  **Eduardo Artés Brichetti**  **First Secretary**  **Chilean Communist Party (Proletarian Action)**  **December 30, 2022**  https://preview.redd.it/mhttgc3gqwaa1.jpg?width=6936&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ef7e622101fdd327125343236dc35b8b2051ea1d
Eleven years since the death of Victor Alekseyevich Vaziulin Vaziulin was probably the most important marxist thinker of the 20th century.  He was a teacher of philosophy His work on the method of Marx's Capital and the development of the Logic Of History are maybe the most advanced marxist theories we have as  a communist movement. Unfortunately his work has not been translated to English yet, but it can be found in other languages.

What happened to the shining path after the death of President Gonzalo? What happened to the Peruvian People's War after the death of President Gonzalo?

how did the left wing parties in France survive the cold war? The politics in France always fascinates me , the left wing parties in France won or were close to be winning in almost every election since 1945 even though France was an important ally to the western bloc during the cold war.  How did the left wing parties survive and even win sometimes the elections during the cold war despite the demonization of communism in the western countries?

Is the vision of history in China (or at least of the CCP) still historical materialism? Western historians and western philosophy of history in general seems to shy away from grand historical theories in recent decades, focussing more on questions on objectivity or the narrative nature of historiography for instance.  Is the marxist vision of history still prevelant in China? Have there been developments or changes in this area of thought?   Since I'm really only familiar with western philosophy of history, I'm not even sure where to begin to look for the Chinese point of view on this topic. Hopefully someone here can help.  Thanks!

Jose Maria Sison's Valedictory Message to the Party and Filipino people
Spanish sources, especially content creators on YouTube. Hi everyone. There is already a few threads on this and one good one, from which I've drawn a couple Spanish-language news sources. I am learning Spanish in my free time and try to consume and take notes on at least an hour a day of immersive content, whether that be text or video. Books are still a little too complex for me, as I am still intermediate. Do any native speakers have some good channel recommendations on YouTube? I've already found Red Planeta, which is pretty good. Any recs are appreciated. I do not mind long videos. Specifically Marxist content creators please. Is there anything like Breakthrough News in Spanish?
Taiwan and China Looking for reading on history of Taiwan in relation to China. Ideally from a pro-china/socialist perspective but not necessary.
Emma Goldman's Zionism a critique of her On Zionism article In this post I will critique a text \[1\] written by the Anarchist Emma Goldman which defends the Zionist settler colonial project. It seems that Anarchists can't get enough off supporting Zionists settler colonial beliefs and actions (e.g. Murray Bookchin \[2\], \[3\]) I will show fragments and then critique the highlighted ideas.  &#x200B;  >In claiming the right of the Arabs to keep out Jewish immigration from Palestine, our good friend is guilty of the same breach of Socialism as his comrade, John McGovern. To be sure the latter makes himself the champion of British Imperialism while Reginald Reynolds sponsors Arab capitalist rights. That is bad enough for a revolutionary socialist. **Worse still is the inconsistency in pleading on behalf of land monopoly, to which the Arabs alone should have the right**.  Emma Goldman makes a completely ignorant argument here. Her claim is tantamount to denouncing the actual Americans (aka the Native Americans for you white folks) defending a “land monopoly” on their ancestral lands and supporting the European settler colonial project. To her, Tecumseh’s and Tupac Amaru’s struggles for ‘land monopoly’ over their ancestral lands would be an unjust struggle against the needed poor ol' White settlers.  >Perhaps my revolutionary education has been sadly neglected, **but I have been taught that the land should belong to those who till the soil**. With all of his deep-seated sympathies with the Arabs, **our comrade cannot possibly deny that the Jews in Palestine have tilled the soil \[*****sic*****\]**. **Tens of thousands of them, young and deeply devout idealists, have flocked to Palestine, there to till the soil under the most trying pioneer conditions**. They have reclaimed wastelands and have turned them into fertile fields and blooming gardens. Now I do not say that therefore Jews are entitled to more rights than the Arabs, but for an ardent socialist to say that the Jews have no business in Palestine seems to me rather a strange kind of socialism.  Here Emma Goldman is just simply making an apologia of Zionist settler colonialism in Palestine. She avers that as the Jews “till the soil”, they have the right to the lands they stole from the Palestinians. This sort of argument was made by the European settlers in order to justify the theft of lands and genocide of Americans.  >Our friend waxes very hot about national independence for the Arabs and for all other peoples under British Dominion. I am not opposed to the struggle for it\*\*, but I do not see the same blessings in national independence under the capitalist régime\*\*. All the advancement claimed for it is like the claims for democracy, a delusion and a snare. **One has to point out some of the countries that have achieved national independence. Poland, for instance, the Baltic States or some of the Balkan countries. Far from being progressive in the true sense, they have become Fascist. Political persecution is not less severe than under the Czar, while anti-Semitism, formerly fostered from on top, has since infested every layer of social life in these countries.**   >   >**However, since our friend champions national independence, why not be consistent and recognize the right of the Zionists or the Jews at large to national independence? If anything, their precarious condition, the fact that they are nowhere wanted, should entitle them to at least the same consideration that our comrade so earnestly gives to the Arabs.**  Here Emma Goldman at first denounces the struggle for independence for oppressed nation's under capitalism, to then defend the Zionist settler colonial project in Palestine which, last time I checked, was done under capitalism. Second, she justifies the settler colonialism of the Zionist movement by claiming that Jews were fleeing from Europe’s newly independent anti-Semitic régimes (e.g. Horthy’s Hungary, Piłsudski Poland, etc.). Fred Hampton once said that you don’t fight racism with more racism, but through race solidarity; the same goes with are Jewish comrades, they shouldn’t fight anti-Semitism with Zionism, but with, as we said before, race solidarity. Last but not least, Emma Goldman mentions the anti-Semitism fostered by Tsarist Russia, but she completely ignores the advances the USSR made in this sphere; combating pogroms, educating its populous in anti-racism and promoting the Jewish culture.  >I know of course that a great many of the Jews can lay no claim to being political refugees. **On the contrary, most of them have remained indifferent to the persecution of workers, socialists, communists, trade-unionists and anarchists, so long as their own skins were safe**. Like the middle-class in Germany and Austria, they have exploited labor and have been antagonistic to any attempt on the part of the masses to better their condition. **Some German Jews had the temerity to say that they would not object to driving out the ‘OstJuden’ (Jews coming from Poland and other countries)**. **All that is true, but the fact remains that since Hitler’s ascendancy to power all Jews without exception have been subjected to the most fiendish persecution and the most horrible indignities, besides being robbed of all of their possessions**. **It therefore seems strange for a Socialist to deny these unfortunate people a chance of taking root in new countries, there to begin a new life**.   >   >The last paragraph in ‘Palestine and Social Policy’ caps the climax. The author writes: “What does it matter who makes a demand or why it is made, or who pays the bill if that demand is just? To reject a just demand is to brand ourselves as friends of tyranny and oppression; to accept it and to work for it is not only our duty but the only policy that will expose the pretensions of our enemies.”   >   >The question is, dear Reginald Reynolds, who is to decide what is a ‘just demand’? Unless one makes oneself guilty of the charge the writer hurls against the Jews, “the intolerable arrogance of people who regard their own race as superior”, **one cannot very well decide whether the demand of natives for the monopoly of their country is any more just than the desperate need of millions of people who are slowly being exterminated**.  In this last fragment I cite, Emma Goldman at first recognises how many well-to-do non-proletarian Jews were indifferent to the persecution of working class activists and revolutionaries and some even holding racist beliefs on other members of their brethren, the OstJuden. But she then falls into the same Hasbara talking points: the Jews were persecuted in Europe by Nazi Germany; therefore the Palestinians couldn’t hold a “land monopoly” on their actual country; therefore they should submit to the Zionist settlers. She also talks about Jews being robbed of their personal possessions. This is pure hypocrisy, “we the Jews have a right to steal Palestinians’ property because it's what the Nazis did to us” is what Emma Goldman is insinuating here.  If any Palestinians or very-well versed Marxists on the Palestinian Nation's History care to add on to this critique with more substantiated and data based critiques, I would really appreciate it.  \[1\] [https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/goldman/works/1938/on-zionism.html](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/goldman/works/1938/on-zionism.html)  \[2\] [https://bennorton.com/anarchist-murray-bookchin-zionist-israel-colonialism/](https://bennorton.com/anarchist-murray-bookchin-zionist-israel-colonialism/)  \[3\][https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/6jp5v4/attacks\_on\_israel\_ignore\_the\_long\_history\_of\_arab/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/6jp5v4/attacks_on_israel_ignore_the_long_history_of_arab/)
Information on the USSR's aid to developing countries?    I've been reading Pietro Gleijese's book Conflicting Missions, and it has some information on Soviet aid to various countries in Africa (plenty of which seems to be quite costly to the USSR with little rewards). I've also read about it providing numerous students from all over the world with scholarships. I know it played a large part in helping North Korea and Vietnam rebuild after their respective wars, and that it provided a lot of money to Cuba and other socialist countries.  But does anyone else have information on Soviet aid to developing countries? And I don't mean anything conflict related (like military equipment to Angola or Vietnam during their wars, or helping Bangladesh become independent etc.) I'm looking for stuff on:  Healthcare   Education   Building of infrastructure   Financial assistance  And I'm also interested in the work of other socialist countries when it comes to this type of thing. I know Cuba has provided tons in healthcare and education to developing countries. So while the USSR is my main interest, anything on other socialist countries would be much appreciated. Thanks

The American Left and the UC Strike Some of you may have been following the strike of academic “workers” throughout the California system which just ended.   https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/23/us/university-california-workers-strike.html  Most people today will not have experience with a union or if they do, it will be with an upstart union in the service sector rather than the old bureaucratic unions that shaped so much of the 20th century. Ironically, “student workers,” a fully 21st century category of dubious analytic power, is one of the few places left where one experiences true yellow unionism and as a result the reformist left parties which cling to the corpse of Fordism and social democracy are all to be found there. That these parties also persist in practice by recruiting college students who have the time to waste on the grunt work of party politics and the naivete to follow orders, campuses going on strike is like heaven for the refuse of the new left. Having just experienced the collapse of the UC strike, the so-called largest strike of academic workers in history, I got to interact with all these forces. The concept of labor aristocracy has a lot of potential to describe new forms of imperialism and social fascism but experiencing the old form that Lenin and Engels knew so well is a useful reminder of where this idea came from and why 20th century communist parties collapsed into reformism and irrelevance. This is far more useful than the abstract debates about foreign policy and radical phraseology all leftists are competent in these days thanks to the internet; real issues of this or that compromise and this or that strategic judgement are where politics really happens and, spoiler, most of the left revealed itself to be garbage.  The UAW is a dying Fordist yellow union which absorbed graduate students to sustain itself and inject a façade of petty-bourgeois youth radicalism. This ended up being wise since much of the leadership of the national union recently went to prison and an election was forced on it by the government and the only thing the union had to show for itself was the recent UC strike which occurred during the election. But a dose of transient semi-workers can’t save a dead body and the result was that the Graduate Student bargaining team members are the same bureaucrats as the national leadership but with pettier ambitions. Given that capitalism is no longer able to compromise with labor and the structural foundation of Fordism has collapsed, neither the UAW as a whole nor the gradate student sub-bureaucracy has any hope of achieving real reforms. The only possible decision is how best to sell selling out.  The strike itself is not that interesting. The union hoped that the university would budge from the threat of a strike because their only reason for existing is the fantasy of labor-management harmony in the interests of capital. Since that did not happen, the union was forced to call a strike they did not want, they believed ontologically would get weaker every day, and wished to end. Just about everything was compromised on immediately and all manner of justifications were offered to let the bureaucrats do their work behind closed doors, only notable because they were so condescending and vacuous that they managed to piss everyone off. Nevertheless, the only real resistance that developed was a dissident faction of the bargaining team bureaucracy that came far too late to do anything. The union used every trick in the book to push through its sell out contract and the dissidents were fractured by campus, lacked the infrastructure to communicate and were always playing catch up, but the fundamental weakness of the “no” vote dissidents was they had no plan except to continue the strike and hope this would somehow motivate the university to reevaluate its austerity. They not only could not escape the logic of economism, they couldn’t even escape the logic of bureaucratic economism, as everything had to remain legal and within the terms set by the majority bargaining team who had been allies just yesterday. The main ideological difference was the union believed the turnout on the picket line was the measure of the strike’s success, meaning every day could only be worse than the previous day (and completely doomed once vacation began), whereas the dissidents believed not submitting grades was the substance of withholding our labor. The former is purely performative and entirely under the union’s control whereas the latter is closer to reality but only enforceable through morality and shame. It was the tactic of the 2020 COLA strike but without any of the democratic and radical features of that strike, had little chance of success, instead ultimately relying on the begrudging legal protection of the same union we were rebelling against to assure isolated teachers withholding grades they were safe.  The difference between the two factions of the union were ultimately irrelevant, abstractly and literally true since the UAW national election produced a mix of old and new factions who will now share power to implement the exact same politics as before. This, in fact, already happened a decade ago when the “Academic Workers for a Democratic Union” overthrew the old bureaucracy of in 2011 to no effect.  https://livinghistory.as.ucsb.edu/tag/awdu/ - some history of the post-Occupy revolt against the union bureaucracy and their wretched self-pity – they were forced to become minor California democrats  The contract is a joke, only 5,000 dollars more than the initial offer of the university before the strike (from an initial demand of 54,000 vs 29,000 to now 34,000), to be achieved in 2 years with no cost of living index, different pay for “prestige universities,” a no-strike clause, and a better contract for postdocs approved first (also with a no-strike clause upon approval) to remove them from the strike, fracture the union for the future, and stick a dagger in the heart of the strike as it was occurring. Given the pay of other graduate students throughout the country, this would have basically happened through the labor market anyway and UC workers are still significantly underpaid compared to many private universities (for example I interviewed a prospective student who instead went to NYU starting at 31,000 right now and 39,000 if she chose to teach). There were also various compromises on disability, international students, and other issues that were sold out purely because of the union’s weakness and incompetence which leaves them open to attacks on identity politics terms; despite being composed of graduate students, the union bureaucracy act like “hard hat” unionists from the 20th century which is remarkable if you think about it. But ideology always follows function; pay anyone 70,000 dollars to work full time for the union, especially with the academic job market today, and they too will lecture you about the importance of the adults in the room compromising behind closed doors no matter their background. Even if the goal of communists was to win reforms through unions, which it is not, this is a terrible contract. Pessimism and infighting are now the order of the day on discord, signal, twitter, and all the other ways isolated and impotent members can amplify their moral outrage in the hope that quantity will transform into quality (and reddit of course).  A representative experience for me was when the contract was being proposed for a 12 month pay period with no guarantee of summer funding, meaning that the actual amount was for 9 months. So you had to take the number they were giving us, divide it by 12, and multiply it by 9. The union refused to acknowledge this simple math and kept avoiding giving the real number, hoping that the larger number would fly by unnoticed. The current amount is for 9 months after a local democrat was brought in to mediate so that whole experience is memory-holed but I still remember it as well as the ghost of Kiev.  With that out of the way, how did the left respond? First up is the DSA. To no one’s surprise, they merely repeated the talking points of the “majority” bargaining team  https://jacobin.com/2022/12/university-of-california-strike-fifth-week-bargaining-table-demands-union-strategy-uaw  The only thing notable about them is that, unlike the rest of the left which slavishly followed the bureaucrats in a position of power, many of the bargaining team members joined the DSA of their own free will prior to the strike. This is partially so they feel like they are socialists - no one is a villain in their own head. But practically, the DSA serves as a good way to connect professionally to younger democrats and aspiring union bureaucrats. Frankly, it would be stupid not to join the DSA unless you are already from a politically connected family. They have a slate running in the UAW as well and have had some success convincing the old senior figures in the union that they need young PMCs to avoid revolution, the strategy of the "squad" transplanted.  Next up is the IMT. Like most actually-existing trots, the IMT survives by cycling through undergraduates who join study groups, graduate to handing out newspapers (or the online equivalent), and eventually burn out. In this case, the IMT sent a small group of undergraduates to the “picket line” (which to be clear was neither a picket nor a line and prevented no one from teaching) for “solidarity.”  https://www.marxist.com/united-states-strike-action-on-the-rise-marxists-join-the-picket-lines.htm  The “socialist revolution” reading group basically just shouted the generic slogans of the strike (and you would be shocked how awful these slogans are, partially because of the history of American union anti-communism and partially because these graduate student cum labor bureaucrats are scared of creativity spiraling out of control). They briefly flirted with insisting on COLA but once it was clear the union bureaucracy would tolerate no further dissent on this issue they fell in line. As you can see that article contains no concrete content and these undergrads pretend at being academic workers rather than bringing their own issues as undergraduates (which is outside the acceptable discourse of the union). Members do not make their party affiliation clear and use their own vague slogans and front group names unless you ask them directly who they are affiliated with.  The PSL sends people, usually one senior member and one young recruit, to walk around in PSL t-shirts and participate in slogans. The shirts sets them apart from the IMT but, more significantly, they are envious of the DSA and try to make friends with leadership of the strike and one day recruit them. They recently posted this article  https://www.liberationnews.org/uc-academic-workers-win-historic-contracts-after-40-day-strike/  completely echoing the talking points of the bargaining team including this paragraph  >The “Vote No” campaign consistently framed the unions’ democratically elected leadership as the main obstacle towards a strong contract. But the strength or weakness of a union does not stem from a handful of leaders, it comes from the entire membership. Rhetoric which replaces this core principle with distrust of fellow coworkers elected to leadership positions sends the message that workers are always doomed to be betrayed. It shifts the focus from the employer to the elected union leadership. Such an orientation makes any contract, however strong, a de facto defeat and promotes demoralization rather than hope, confidence and a deeper commitment for the next fight.  The PSL are the only ones who unapologetically criticize the no vote campaign, a position everyone else is too embarrassed to state openly given the yes vote already won and there is nothing to gain rubbing it in the faces of the rank-and-file. Only Marcyism allows this freedom from all principle.  Finally the WSWS/SEP. They are the only party which consistently stood against the union’s sellouts at every turn and the only one to cover the strike in depth.  https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2022/12/26/ucst-d26.html  https://www.wsws.org/en/topics/workersCategory/2022-university-california-academic-workers-strike  This was partially because they decided to run a candidate in the UAW election but also their workload is insane. Basically, their strategy is to put out statements and flyers on campus and hope that people contact them. Eventually this turned into a “rank and file” strike committee as you can see in the article which was basically the local party members and a few grad students who had contacted them. The weakness of their line was that as the “no” campaign developed and rank-and-file committees started to form, SEP cared about party control over their own group and wasn’t involved in the mass movement. To be fair, as I pointed out the mass movement was merely a factional split from the bargaining team with tactical differences so subordinating to its leadership would be a terrible idea. But 99% of rank-and-file members have no idea the “rank-and-file” strike committee exists and now that the dust has settled, it’s not clear what was gained except a few more party sympathizers. They are, for good or ill, very clear about their political positions and manage to tie the strike to both the history of the 4th international and the war in Ukraine and as a result could not get casual “friends of the party” even if they wanted to. I was peripherally involved with WSWS during the strike because they were the only ones with any principles but they dug their own grave. For example, party members would get the police called on them if they showed up to the picket line and they would get shouted down and/or muted if the UAW election campaign was brought up (though the latter happened to basically anyone who criticized the union during online meetings). This points to the violent enforcement behind revisionism, part of the long bloody history of social democracy’s suppression of the left, but these are also things that have to be expected and can only be overcome by making oneself too important and too powerful to be excluded. How this is to be done is not clear, I am criticizing myself in this paragraph as well (though it is this self-criticism which separates us readers from all of these parties who are all completely sure of their righteousness).   As previously mentioned, after the garbage contract in 2018 a wildcat strike over COLA (cost of living adjustment) occurred in early 2020 which the union tried to control and/or kill which was much more promising. That had mass meetings, real political discussion, cooperation across campuses, and efforts to extend the strike to undergraduates, adjuncts, custodial staff, etc. That was mostly defeated by Covid which broke the momentum and no one could have predicted. However, the union did fight for those who had been fired to be reinstated after the wildcat strike had been completely defeated so I imagine a backroom deal took place. I bring this up because the fact that basically nothing happened between then and now shows even the SEP, for all its principles, made few inroads over the past 3 years. Given the current contract fundamentally destroyed inter-campus and inter-union solidarity, the next fight will be much more difficult, so defeat now is not just a success for the next fight.  As for the rest of the left, it was nowhere to be found. Socialist Alternative released a statement supporting the mainstream campaign for a “no” vote  https://www.socialistalternative.org/2022/12/23/tentative-agreements-fall-short-for-uc-academic-workers-how-can-more-be-won/  but I did not encounter any of them. My assumption is just like the SEP puts all of its time into WSWS, the SA puts all of its time into Kshama Sawant, basically the only thing that separates them from another tail of the Sanders movement and Green Party. Perhaps in Seattle they exist.  CPUSA released an article supporting the bargaining team  https://www.peoplesworld.org/article/uc-graduate-student-academic-workers-reach-tentative-pact-ratification-vote-underway/  which only mentions the “no” campaign briefly at the end (you can see how offensive the PSL statement is in comparison to even the totally bankrupt CPUSA) but they were also not involved in any way that I saw. Since they are not as offensive as the PSL, they are merely derivative of the DSA.  FRSO put up a statement critical of the union but otherwise generic  https://www.fightbacknews.org/2022/12/8/university-california-academic-workers-strike-say-no-cola-no-contract  and they, like the American Maoist left, are more interested in foreign policy where positions are clear and inconsequential. If any of these parties do care about labor, it is the railroad strike where the Biden administration stepping in to end the strike was the best thing that could have happened to the left, allowing it to criticize a clear bad guy in the state rather than labor reformism within the union movement (except for the CPUSA of course which found a way to defend the democrats – funny to mock online but irrelevant). I could respect a Maoist polemic dismissing the very concept of American labor, at least that's a principle that would differentiate them, but instead we get this half-assed stuff.  I am critical of the very concept of academic-workers, despite or perhaps because I am one. Nevertheless, there are some interesting lessons. First, most of the left desperately wishes to become the official communist parties of Eurocommunism or, in the American context, a social democratic party of the European type. This is justified with reference to the “sectarianism” and “ultraleftism” of the new left, now 50+ years old, but as soon as the context is an old style labor struggle, the old revisionism comes out. For communists, discussing foreign policy is important but at the level of party ideology, it is basically irrelevant. Of course, one should not join a party that is explicitly in favor of war and imperialism but beyond empty rhetoric, the question of the labor aristocracy (both the old union bureaucracy type and the new global commodity production type) is decisive and always comes up on the side of revisionism and social fascism. Even this bizarre combination of anti-imperialism in rhetoric and reformism in politics is now common; all that’s left is cross promotion between parties, the new post-post-colonial intellectuals like Vijay Prashad, and internet personalities.  All American parties at present have room for only two types of people: cadres who work full time for the party and important people who can help the party get attention and/or positions of power in institutions. It is natural that professional union reps fit into both of these categories whereas for the WSWS and any other principled organization, the demand to work against the union full time as well as maintain one’s life and job is nearly impossible. Frankly speaking, only a very specific type of person can do it and you, the reader, are basically worthless to them as am I. But if you choose to spend your life working for a party that at least has principles don’t let me stop you and don’t let the historical role of Trotskyism distract you from avoiding the truly vile parties. Finally, a rather obvious point: you never know whether your position is ultra-left, right, or correct until history has judged. The only comfort is understanding that, in general, ultraleftism is an aberration that arises in specific historical periods of revolutionary upsurge and was always seen as a disagreement among friends whereas rightism is the norm under capitalism and characteristic of enemies, at least in the first world where these are questions of strategy in politics rather than strategy in guerilla warfare. Even if you don't agree with this, we can all agree that any criticism of the ultraleftism of the 1970s or 1930s is totally moribund and has justified decades of revisionism and unfiltered reaction as I highlighted here. It is better to maintain one’s principles, even if this leads to isolation, than to abandon them for relevancy, since principles today may lead to success in the future whereas opportunism will always lead to failure today and tomorrow. Worse than isolation is irrelevance: there is simply no reason for most parties to exist now that the DSA has colonized the reformist left. All that's left is to make this clear to anyone who still believes the ostensible communism and anti-imperialism of these parties has any substance.
Do you know of any Marxist geography or/and feminist geography podcasts? I'm reading Mean Streets by Don Mitchell and it's my first time reading a book by a Marxist geographer, or perhaps the first time doing so having read the foundational prerequisites and being cognizant of all that's going on. My mind is blown by the lens and I'm wondering if there are any podcasts in the realm of Marxist (or feminist) geography.
KKE's 18th congress resolution on socialism This text is from 2009 but it still is very important. KKE had a collective study and conversation that lasted years (from 1995) in order to analyze what went wrong in the 20th century socialism, focusing mostly in USSR.  This is not a complete process as on this text it mostly focuses on the economic basis, the study to complete the analysis on other aspects of sociopolitical issues of 20th century socialism is still going on for KKE.

Looking for books to radicalize a catholic friend I have a friend that is really into religion, but he has been listening to my marxist point of view and even agreeing some time. The only problem is that he sees communism and his religious beliefs as irreconcilable. Recently, he as asked me if I had some book recommendations on that topic, so he could make up his opinion. So I'm searching for some books about religion and Marxism, but I can't really find anything good enough  Maybe you have any advice?

Lavender & Red - a communist book about the history of the LGBTQ+ struggle I've been looking for something like this, and finally found it! It's written by Leslie Feinberg (you might've heard of xer already) and covers everything from traditions not aligned with Christian values being destroyed by British colonialism to the modern LGBT movement. Here's the link: https://www.workers.org/book/lavender-red/
It's scary to see how pro-war a lot of "leftists" are in America Mods, delete this if this is not the right place to post. But I have no idea where else to post this given that it's always met with hostility.  The war in the Ukraine and Iraq are both parallel wars : a nuclear armed power launching an illegal invasion in an attempt to subdue one of their former puppet states and slaughtering thousands (millions in the latter) of civilians.     I remember how being anti-war got you labelled as a saddam hussein supporter and how they created a false narrative where you either support the war or don't. Back then I assumed it was because the conservatives were in power, now I realize that liberals are no different.     Just merely saying that you don't want to give Ukraine billions of dollars worth of military weapons to continue that infernal war is met with backlash.     Government officials and millions of redditors are calling everyone who opposes military aid to the Ukraine : traitors, pro-russian, russian bots, criminals, communists , nazis, genocide-supporters, putin sympathizers,etc.     It's scary to see how these "liberals" are so totalitarian that a simply not wanting to PROLONG a proxy war is met with screeching, high school level insults and attempts to silence any form of dissent.      Looking at reddit comments, seeing all these impressionable young people salivate at the idea of destroying russia and hero-worship Zelensky like he's an objectively good hero for the universe is scary.      I'm really distraught and I know I should have known better but it's clear that liberals and conservatives really adore to go to war and silence any form of dissent.     They complain about fascism and totalitarianism while trying to brand any non-conformist action as wrongthink, the irony.     What would you do in such a situation to make a difference?
1917 Russian Constituent Assembly elections? So the other day I was having a debate with my friend about the russian Revolution and the Bolsheviks, They were arguing the Bolsheviks were authoritarians and an undemocratic force, whereas I was trying to defend them, they then brought up the constituent elections of 1917, which they argued were a clear sign of Bolshevik authoritarianism, and because I knew so little about the election I didn't have much to say, and I couldn't find any real leftist sources on the matter, So I came here to ask, what happened?, And why would the Bolsheviks overthrow a democratic election if that was the will of the people?

Clarifying the Economic Basis for the Withing Away of the State Was inactive on this sub for a couple of years and when I came back I was pleasantly surprised by the new antirevisionist line of the mods and the community. But I also noticed that there are a lot more low-quality posts (in good or bad faith) here now. In the spirit of continuing discourse between marxists I decided I wanted to post about something I've seen asked about on this sub and others quite frequently - the dictatorship of the proletariat and State power. Often times it seems leftists will wander onto this sub with watered-down understandings of socialism and marxism.  I'll be citing passages from V.I. Lenin's *The State and Revolution* and clarifying them with commentary from a contemporary perspective within the imperial core. None of these are original ideas but we need to discuss state formation and the marxist theory of the state thoroughly and scientifically, if we seriously want to use it to wage a political revolution. Thats what I'm attempting here. Keep in mind that according to the marxist method, the theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat isn't scientifically correct just because lenin said it. It's because we can observe the behavior and laws of the State and proletarian dictatorship in our material reality and interpret them into a form compatible with human understanding. Thankfully, we live in a time where social and natural scientists are combining their expertise and revolutionizing the field of history with new methodologies and techniques, leaving behind a plethora of evidence from societies all over the globe that vindicate the marxist theory of state formation in the process.  Neoliberal social scientists, and not coincidentally, anarchists, view the State primarily as made up of dominant governing institutions with a "monopoly on violence", a phrase which they often reference from the work of german sociologist Max Weber. Although the monopoly on violence (through police, prisons, the military, and the legal apparatus; reinforced by ideas, politics, and culture) is a crucial aspect of the State, basing the entire definition of this characteristic of the State is an incomplete and therefore false definition of what the State is and its function. This definition assumes that the State is an overarching and neutral entity that stands above the rest of society. This is what the state pretends to be. Neoliberals want to preserve this fantasy state, while anarchists want to destroy it. The State **cannot and never will be** entirely cut off from the rest of society; a neutral supreme actor. Although historically it has constantly strived to insulate itself from the masses, it is tied up in the various contradictory interests of the masses.  Lenin in *The State and Revolution* quoting Engels :  >"Because the state arose from the need to hold class antagonisms in check, but because it arose, at the same time, in the midst of the conflict of these classes, it is, as a rule, the state of the most powerful, economically dominant class, which, through the medium of the state, becomes also the politically dominant class, and thus acquires new means of holding down and exploiting the oppressed class....” The ancient and feudal states were organs for the exploitation of the slaves and serfs; likewise, “the modern representative state is an instrument of exploitation of wage-labor by capital.  The economic interests of various people in society are ultimately determined by their direct relationship to the means of production (are they service workers, small business owners, migrant farm workers, landlords, software engineers at a private sector firm, CEOs, corporate owners?). In amerika most people are workers, professionals, small owners, or big owners, and at the end of the day, their economic status is the limiting (but not always predetermining) factor in what they are capable of doing with their life. When these interests come into conflict with each other they create societal systems to limit this conflict to acceptable standards. And these standards, this monopoly on violence, are created and dominated by the most economically powerful class. The origin of the State and politics is bound up in the origins of class society.  The State itself is a product of class society and where ever the conflicts between classes arise is where the State emerges, pretending to be in the interest of everyone but in reality in the interest of the ruling classes. In different eras of history, common people had a much different relationship with production than we do today. Slavery used to be the standard way of managing a functional imperial economy in antiquity. This evolved into feudalism in europe when the manorial system replaced slavery after the breakup of the carolingian empire. All of these events saw struggle in many forms between various economic classes, culminating in political struggles such as the French revolution and the uprisings of 1848, where feudalism was done away with and capitalist "democracy" was introduced, founded on colonialism the monarchies had already started. This brought us to capitalist relations, and as I'm sure you all well know, we are now at a point where we have enough resources and productive capacity to feed, house, clothe, etc... everyone on the planet, given equitable distribution. The necessary material conditions for socialism and communism are alredy here.  So what happens when colonized and working people, wage laborers, and their exploited allies, launch a political revolution? Members of the exploited masses have seized power in the interest of themselves and the broad masses, the working people. We are now at a point where there is a State, the ruling class institutions backed by force that assert their interests on the rest of the social classes, are now controlled by, and in the interests of, the everyday person. This is the dictatorship of the proletariat. Owners and settlers will lose their political and economic status and become like everybody else.  It is important to note that no matter what political and ideological goals a worker's revolution has tasked itself with, the revolutionary system they create will always be a State (organized class violence and hegemony of one class over others) and this State will always take the form of a proletarian dictatorship. The catalonian anarchists, just like the bolsheviks, produced a **proletarian dictatorship** \- though these worker States expressed authority in different ways and one was armed with a scientific world outlook that brought it historical significance. History has proven that proletarian dictatorship must be centralized enough to effectively organize military force against capitalism-imperialism. And this expansion of the proletarian state is actually key to the ultimate withering away of the State generally  As Lenin points out in chapter 5 of *The State and Revolution*  >... during the transition from capitalism to communism suppression is still necessary, but it is now the suppression of the exploiting minority by the exploited majority. A special apparatus, a special machine for suppression, the “state”, is still necessary, but this is now a transitional state. It is no longer a state in the proper sense of the word; for the suppression of the minority of exploiters by the majority of the wage slaves of yesterday is comparatively so easy, simple and natural a task that it will entail far less bloodshed than the suppression of the risings of slaves, serfs or wage-laborers, and it will cost mankind far less. And it is compatible with the extension of democracy to such an overwhelming majority of the population that the need for a special machine of suppression will begin to disappear. Naturally, the exploiters are unable to suppress the people without a highly complex machine for performing this task, but the people can suppress the exploiters even with a very simple “machine”, almost without a “machine”, without a special apparatus, by the simple organization of the armed people (such as the Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies, we would remark, running ahead).   >   >Lastly, only communism makes the state absolutely unnecessary, for there is nobody to be suppressed--“nobody” in the sense of a class, of a systematic struggle against a definite section of the population. We are not utopians, and do not in the least deny the possibility and inevitability of excesses on the part of *individual persons*, or the need to stop such excesses. In the first place, however, no special machine, no special apparatus of suppression, is needed for this: this will be done by the armed people themselves, as simply and as readily as any crowd of civilized people, even in modern society, interferes to put a stop to a scuffle or to prevent a woman from being assaulted. And, secondly, we know that the fundamental social cause of excesses, which consist in the violation of the rules of social intercourse, is the exploitation of the people, their want and their poverty. With the removal of this chief cause, excesses will inevitably begin to "wither away". We do not know how quickly and in what succession, but we do know they will wither away. With their withering away the state will also wither away.  The dictatorship of the proletariat is uniquely positioned to abolish the State, and here's why. As the worker State **expands itself**, delegating more and more tasks, administrative functions, and political power to people of the economic class it represents, the working people, it will **abolish itself** in the process. Here is Engels on this subject:  >"The proletariat seizes from state power and turns the means of production into state property to begin with. But thereby it abolishes itself as the proletariat, abolishes all class distinctions and class antagonisms, and abolishes also the state as state. Society thus far, operating amid class antagonisms, needed the state, that is, an organization of the particular exploiting class, for the maintenance of its external conditions of production, and, therefore, especially, for the purpose of forcibly keeping the exploited class in the conditions of oppression determined by the given mode of production (slavery, serfdom or bondage, wage-labor). The state was the official representative of society as a whole, its concentration in a visible corporation. But it was this only insofar as it was the state of that class which itself represented, for its own time, society as a whole: in ancient times, the state of slave-owning citizens; in the Middle Ages, of the feudal nobility; in our own time, of the bourgeoisie. When at last it becomes the real representative of the whole of society, it renders itself unnecessary. As soon as there is no longer any social class to be held in subjection, as soon as class rule, and the individual struggle for existence based upon the present anarchy in production, with the collisions and excesses arising from this struggle, are removed, nothing more remains to be held in subjection — nothing necessitating a special coercive force, a state. The first act by which the state really comes forward as the representative of the whole of society — the taking possession of the means of production in the name of society — is also its last independent act as a state. State interference in social relations becomes, in one domain after another, superfluous, and then dies down of itself. "  When we reach a point where everyone is a worker, and where production is so advanced that everyone can not only afford to keep themselves alive but directly participate in politics and economic planning, the proletarian State will truly be in the interest of everyone. Once we reach this level of production and have been socialized into these relations with each other, once we get used to sharing and controlling the economy equitably as a society, then *the functions of the State will lose their political character*, and therefore, there will be no need to organize violence along class lines around them.  >From the moment all members of society, or at least the vast majority, have learned to administer the state *themselves*, have taken this work into their own hands, have organized control over the insignificant capitalist minority, over the gentry who wish to preserve their capitalist habits and over the workers who have been thoroughly corrupted by capitalism--from this moment the need for government of any kind begins to disappear altogether. The more complete the democracy, the nearer the moment when it becomes unnecessary. The more democratic the “state” which consists of the armed workers, and which is "no longer a state in the proper sense of the word", the more rapidly *every form* of state begins to wither away.   >   >For when *all* have learned to administer and actually to independently administer social production, independently keep accounts and exercise control over the parasites, the sons of the wealthy, the swindlers and other "guardians of capitalist traditions", the escape from this popular accounting and control will inevitably become so incredibly difficult, such a rare exception, and will probably be accompanied by such swift and severe punishment (for the armed workers are practical men and not sentimental intellectuals, and they scarcely allow anyone to trifle with them), that the *necessity* of observing the simple, fundamental rules of the community will very soon become a *habit*.  This will take time and class struggle within the dictatorship of the proletariat. Political struggles still occur under socialism until communism is achieved - when our political and cultural systems finally reflect the full potential of our current productive forces.  >The economic basis for the complete withering away of the state is such a high state of development of communism at which the antithesis between mental and physical labor disappears, at which there consequently disappears one of the principal sources of modern social inequality--a source, moreover, which cannot on any account be removed immediately by the mere conversion of the means of production into public property, by the mere expropriation of the capitalists.  This is why we need to encourage mass movements and class struggle under socialism and proletarian dictatorship, which takes the form of cultural revolution. We need state power to extend to everybody. If everybody is in charge, then suddenly nobody is in charge, and humanity will have moved entirely beyond any need or desire to have people in charge in the first place; onto new historical challenges and adventures. This isn't the end of violence or despair or disaster or all the worst elements of the "human condition" but it will mark qualatitive advancement in the history of society, the freedom of the individual and quality of life.  The State - like everything else - exists because of historical context and conditions, meaning it won't exist forever. As Engels puts it,  >“The state, then, has not existed from all eternity. There have been societies that did without it, that had no idea of the state and state power. At a certain stage of economic development, which was necessarily bound up with the split of society into classes, the state became a necessity owing to this split. We are now rapidly approaching a stage in the development of production at which the existence of these classes not only will have ceased to be a necessity, but will become a positive hindrance to production. They will fall as they arose at an earlier stage. Along with them the state will inevitably fall. Society, which will reorganize production on the basis of a free and equal association of the producers, will put the whole machinery of state where it will then belong: into a museum of antiquities, by the side of the spinning-wheel and the bronze axe."

Does the US government want the overthrow of the government of Iran? If so, why? I've been seeing a lot of news about Iran and how their regime supresses women and limit their rights, as well as the sudden death sentences the government has been issuing to protesters. Of course, I oppose those practices, but I'm suspicious that western media is pushing against Iran for other hidden reasons(maybe economic or power interests?)  For example, yesterday a palestinian football player was killed by Israeli forces and there hasn't been any scandal in western media, in contrast to what I've seen reported about Iran.   So, given that western media is controlled mainly by the US, does the US government have any hidden interests in the overthrow of the Iran government?

What are your thoughts on the film 'The Death of Stalin'? Being someone who kinda like VEEP and has some experience with Armando Iannucci's works, as communists, what are your thoughts about his film The Death of Stalin?  Do you believe it's portrayal of certain events and actions taken place in it are accurate? If not, why? And maybe you can also share your thoughts on Armando himself and his works, ideology and maybe even criticisms of it.   Thank you.
Thoughts on the recent change in China with regards to Zero-Covid Policy Hello all, Was wondering what communists' thoughts were on this recent covid policy change. To me its either unfathomably idiotic or reactionary; given what I've seen on Chinese media the official line is pro-herd immunity, downplaying the severity of the virus, the "Covid is no worse than a cold" line. If the current approach continues I don't see how the situation would be any better than the catastrophe that happened in India. It is still early on but if a change is to happen there is no time to waste, given New Year's proximity (mass gatherings) and covid's exponential growth. Zero Covid was an enormous massive success, and its overturning is frankly fascist.

On joining the PCE in Spain Hello! I have been going through a process of fully accepting communism as the way forward for us all, I have started reading theory and wish to take this seriously.  I wish to join a communist organization/party here in Spain, previous posts here and in other communist subreddits have said that like in other places, the situation for communist organizations in Spain is far from ideal, for example the PCE currently being run by revisionists as far as I understand, but some posters say that the revolutionary faction within the party is actually coming close to overcoming the revisionists and I should join to turn the tide.  These previous posts were done years ago and I'd like to know given the current situation if it would be a good idea to try to fight within the PCE to help bring it back to revolutionary lines or if I shoud look for a smaller, better aligned party or group.
have you been affected by communism I am thinking about joining CPUSA and the YCL (young communist League but I am afraid of what it will do to my future, have any of you guys have been denied service refused from colleges or public places because of believing in communism? I would like to know if I should join or not I am 14 so there is a lot that can go wrong in life if I chose this path.

SOAS University of London Does anyone have any experience with this university? Can someone with an unapologetic anti-revisionist Marxist perspective survive a PhD and publish works on political economy and modern history there?  Walter Rodney, who wrote the legendary "How Europe Underdeveloped Africa," went there. I have the ability to write a similar book for a region where a Marxist work outlining its history and political economy does not exist.  I feel like there is a contradiction with modernity. Capitalism has brought great advances in science, technology, and human knowledge, but due to the exploitative nature of imperialism, the advancement of human knowledge can only be carried out by a select group of people mostly in imperialist countries. It is contradictory that the people most able to explain the exploitative nature of the world economy and expose bourgeois apologetics are also the most likely to use their ability in defense of the exploitation of their own people. Here I am talking mostly about people such as myself who have roots in exploited countries. I do not have much patience for the "post-colonial" nonsense that gets talked about now. If only these people used their energy to actually read the three volumes of Capital as well as modern theories of imperialism and further our understanding of our current situation.  I am lucky enough to not have to worry about money. Does anyone know of any good universities in Europe/America where an anti-revisionist Marxist can actually survive a PhD? Is the best path forward blog posts and reaching out to left-wing publishers with a manuscript?

1970s-1980s Soviet dagestani dance This is a very specific post but I think this is the last place I saw it at one point. I’m looking for a video that was taken in the 70s/80s of a traditional dagestani dance that was filmed in the Soviet Union for cultural purposes for those of the region. Unfortunately I do not remember the name of the video or the dance, but it was done by people of the dagestani origin in this time period and they all wore black clothes along with boots and hats that I believe to be ushanke’s?? (Unsure of how to spell it so apologies) no specific reason I’m asking for this other than it was a video I had saved from either this sub or some other unrelated communist sub and it was a beautiful video I’d like to see again Lmao

"Refuse" of production and their value On Capital (Tome 1, Chapter 8)  there's this paragraph:  " On the other hand, a means of production may take part as a whole in the formation of value, while into the labour-process it enters only bit by bit. Suppose that in spinning cotton, the waste for every 115 lbs. used amounts to 15 lbs., which is converted, not into yarn, but into “devil’s dust.” Now, although this 15 lbs. of cotton never becomes a constituent element of the yarn, yet assuming this amount of waste to be normal and inevitable under average conditions of spinning, its value is just as surely transferred to the value of the yarn, as is the value of the 100 lbs. that form the substance of the yarn. The use-value of 15 lbs. of cotton must vanish into dust, before 100 lbs. of yarn can be made. The destruction of this cotton is therefore a necessary condition in the production of the yarn. And because it is a necessary condition, and for no other reason, the value of that cotton is transferred to the product. The same holds good for every kind of refuse resulting from a labour-process,  **so far at least as such refuse cannot be further employed as a means in the production of new and independent use-values**. Such an employment of refuse may be seen in the large machine works at Manchester, where mountains of iron turnings are carted away to the foundry in the evening, in order the next morning to re-appear in the workshops as solid masses of iron "        I was wondering, what would be the value of the refuse if they were to become use-values? And since the value of constant capital is only transferred, how would the utility/use-value"ity" of the refuse affect the amount of value transferred in the production of the commodity from which the refuse came from?

Left-leaning statisticians/data analysts? I've been looking for statisticians/data analysts that are of more left-leaning views than the more center-right liberal perspectives we usually get from a lot of the statistics academic environments. Basically, people using statistical data to help inform of political situations, show the consequences of capitalist systems on the working class and global south, and/or disprove myths regarding socialism.   The closest thing I know of are of some leftist economists like Wolff, Cockshott, etc. But I'm looking for people more in fields of statistics & probability. Any names or sources would be welcome.

Why do so many supposed communists take reactionary, liberal positions on AI and AI art? If you're a communist and you have a decent grasp on historical materialism, then you should understand that continued technological development, including automation and AI, is nessecery for humanity to move beyond capitalism. You should also be opposed to the existence of copyright and intellectual "property" laws for obvious reasons.  Yet many self identified communists recently are taking vocal, reactionary positions against AI art, citing a general opposition to human labor being automated as well as a belief in copyright law, two nonsensical positions for any communist to hold.  What's the deal?

Letter from the Union of Communists of Ukraine
Does Capitalism enable narcissism? Over the past few months, I've had a lot of exposure to discussion about Narcissistic Personality Disorder, or NPD. I'm currently in therapy, I plan on continuing therapy, and I want to be clear that I'm not asking this question as a way to excuse my narcissism or anything like that. However, I've noticed an increasing prevalence of people who lob around accusations that people they don't like or who hurt them are in fact pathologically narcissistic.  I've been unable to shake the association that most of the criteria for NPD are in fact behaviors that are highly encouraged for their own sake in capitalistic societies. The criteria are (according to the DSM V):  * A grandiose logic of self-importance * A fixation with fantasies of infinite success, control, brilliance, beauty, or idyllic love * A credence that he or she is extraordinary and exceptional and can only be understood by, or should connect with, other extraordinary or important people or institutions * A desire for unwarranted admiration * A sense of entitlement * Interpersonally oppressive behavior * No form of empathy * Resentment of others or a conviction that others are resentful of him or her * A display of egotistical and conceited behaviors or attitudes  Most or possibly even every person who, for example, owns a business (large or small) displays these symptoms. Capitalism rewards that which is profitable and not that which is helpful (although most capitalists will argue that the latter is a byproduct of the former). Of course, the myth of Narcissus comes from a pre-capitalistic society and I'm sure that people with these traits were born and raised in socialist states as well. That said, does it seem contradictory to others that these behavioral patterns are both encouraged and pathologized?
Cuban communists propose actions in the face of complex reality - Prensa Latina
Mapping British Communist Organisations. Hi Comrades,     I've just been trying to read and research the history of the Communist movement in Britain. I found this map called the \*\*Timeline of the Irish Left\*\* and was wondering if it already existed somewhere else.     If no one knows of a project similar to this, then I'm going to start putting the data I have together into some kind of readable format and I'll try and post it here sometime over the winter.
How can I learn history? YouTube history is pretty bad. Major channels straight up don’t cite sources and on the off chance that I know the topic they straight up lie half the time. How can I critically engage with history if I don’t know a lick about the history of France for example? I guess both books and strategies are what I’m looking for.
Is Okishio's theorem consistent in Marxism? Nobuo Okishio's theorem counteracting Marx's law of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall, stating that if a company cuts cost and wage remains constant then profit can only go up, is very controversial in some Marxist circles. Some have accepted it by disregarding Marx's law since there are plenty of other ways to prove crisis theory, but others have affirmed that Marx was instead talking about the law of constant wage share. Other Marxists have disagreed with it simply based on the fact it used the Sraffa model. Thoughts?     Complete context: [http://pombo.free.fr/groll1989.pdf](http://pombo.free.fr/groll1989.pdf)

The Tsar’s New Clothes I – From Soviet Social-imperialism to Russian imperialism today
Does anyone have a good podcast episode or podcast series on Vietnam? My best friend is Vietnamese and will be visiting soon, and I may go with her. I know the general history but I really want to learn more. I know there are a lot of good books, but I’ve been reading kinda slowly and podcasts are a lot easier to get through for me.   I’ve read and listened to things about the pentagon papers, but I’m looking for a more comprehensive history about Vietnam. All recommendations are appreciated!
Metalworkers from Peraius (Greece) ship building zone demonstrate against the Master Plan of chinese COSCO to shut down the ship yards  Our "comrades" from the CCP have bought the whole Peraius port in Greece and have plans to make it a post from the "Belt and road initiative", by closing down the ship yards of Perama, sending hundreds of wokers to unemployment. The workers demonstrated today against these plans and demand that the ship yards will stay.   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOlBAVtefkI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOlBAVtefkI)
Hindus vs Muslims: Manufacturing Communal Violence at the Service of Fascism in South Asia
Fractiousness and tendencies in marxist movements Just a couple of questions I've been unable to find answers to so far, hoping someone finds them interesting enough to comment:  &#x200B;  1. Why has the broad socialist/communist/marxist movement been so fractious over the years? Is it due to differing interpretations of the original texts by Marx and Engels or something else? It seems obvious to me that any social movement whose energy gets diverted into discussions of theory loses its potential to be a force in society. 2. Just as an aside, but maybe related, what is meant by "tendency" in the actual names of different schools of thought within Marxism? I understand the meaning in terms such as the tendency of the rate of profit to fall, but why does (as an example) the (Trotskyist) International Marxist Tendency call itself a tendency? Why that specific word?  Any and all comments welcome!
Reading about the arts in the USSR So often you hear about how the arts were crushed in the USSR. Is there a source to read more about how music, theater, etc were under the different USSR administrations? Obviously later on there was a burgeoning film culture but so often people cite Shostakovich under Stalin and part of me wonders how much is true, given how much propaganda we’re always fed.
I’m seeing a lot of news about Pedro Castillo’s attempt to dissolve Peruvian congress from western news outlets, is anyone here from Peru that knows more about the situation? As the title states, don’t really trust western news on something like this and I’m genuinely curious of the background of this story and how it came to this. Any help would be appreciated thank you!
Murderer of Chris Hani being released South African communist here for a rant.    The South African constitutional court has decided to release the Polish national who murdered the leader of the South African Communist Party. Janusz Walus murdered Chris Hani in 1993, one year before the first democratic elections in South Africa.    The SACP was then and is now in a coalition with the ruling party and, next to Nelson Mandela, Chris Hani was the second most powerful man in the newly free South Africa.      Walus is an international terrorist who performed a political assassination on one of Africa's most successful revolutionaries, and yet he is being released from prison.      A few days ago, his blockmate stabbed him in the stomach several times. Walus is now in hospital but is still due to be released and likely extradited to Poland.    Polish fascists have taken to the streets in a pre-emptive 'hero's welcome' [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/11/heros-welcome-janusz-walus-apartheid-hitman-chris-hani-poland](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/11/heros-welcome-janusz-walus-apartheid-hitman-chris-hani-poland)     As much of a pacifist as I am, I can say that Walus is extremely lucky that he lost his South African citizenship in 2017 and will therefore likely not be released into the South African general populace because the SACP and various other groups are absolutely livid that our constitutional court has made this decision.      This is why I believe in the democratisation of the judicial system. If the release of a struggle hero, leader of uMkhonte we Sizwe, personal friend and political ally of Madiba, anti-apartheid military veteran and guerilla fighter were to be put to vote, I can guarantee you that Walus would rot in jail for the rest of his stinking life.   &#x200B;  Rot in hell, bozo

Combatting revisionist ideas Hi comrades,  I'm a Marxist-Leninist and member of my YCL branch. In the time that you've been Marxists yourselves, have you ever doubted your own beliefs and, if so, how did you overcome that? Do you reccomend any theory? I imagine this is a temporary slump, and have been reading Mao's quotes on self-criticism and incorrect thought. Thanks!

SK trucking protests "President Yoon Suk-yeol has said his administration would not give in to what it calls "unjustified demands" by the truckers union as the second major strike in less than six months disrupts supplies of cars, cement and fuel. The interior minister and a ruling party spokesperson have both called the truckers "labour aristocracy"."  I'm intrigued that the SK government would use this term. Particularly in this context. I would not think that SK government officials would know about Marxist theories of labour aristocracy. So what kinda meaning do they apply behind this term?

J. Sakai Misquoting in Settlers I have been told to move this here from r/communism101  So I have been reading Settlers but came to a problem while I was reading. I decided to check quotes from Sakai on page 76 where Sakai said:  >In his 1920 history of the strike, Foster (the supposed "communist") repeated the lie that Afrikan workers had "***lined up with the bosses***. " In fact, Foster even said that in resolving the differences between Euro- Amerikan and Afrikan labor "***The negro has the more difficultpart***" since the Afrikan worker was becoming ' ***a professional strike - breaker***. " And militant white workers knew what they were supposed to do to a "professional strike-breaker."  I looked at The Great Steel Strike And Its Lessons from William Z Foster, which I believed Sakai was quoting from, but it appears Sakai took these words completely out of context:  >They know little of the race problem in industry who declare that it can be settled merely by the unions opening their doors to the negroes. It is much more complex than that, and will require the best thought that conscientious whites and blacks can give it. The negro has the more difficult part to solve, in resisting the insidious efforts of unscrupulous white employers and misguided intellectuals of his own race to make a professional strike-breaker of him. But I am confident that he will win out and will take his place where he belongs in the industrial fight, side by side with the white worker.  [https://www.marxists.org/archive/foster/1920/great-steel-strike-its-lessons/ch11.htm](https://www.marxists.org/archive/foster/1920/great-steel-strike-its-lessons/ch11.htm)  This is somewhat disillusioning but I believe there's no way I could've been the only person to spot this and that there is an answer out there. Thanks.

Are There Any Romanian Communists Left? I was recently in Romania for a short vacation and I had an observation: the youth of Romania today are lost. They like to picture themselves as Westerners. They suffer from severe Stockholm Syndrome, they like their oppressors, they like the idea that when they'll become old enough, they could follow the footsteps of millions of their brothers and sisters and leave their country for "better, more enlightened, richer and more cultured" lands like Germany, Italy and the UK. They work hard so that they may be equipped with the right western mindset and values to fit in elsewhere, they have no desire to remain. The prices are high, wages are almost starvation-low, healthcare is horrific, housing is abysmal, it looks as if nothing but malls and shopping centers were built in the last 30 years, oh sorry, a handful of houses for corrupt rich people were built. You see quite a few BMW and Mercedeses but it feels almost surrealistic, considering everything around and below these vehicles is crumbling and shattering. So I'll get back to the question in the title: Are There Any Communists Left in Romania? I'm not talking about old timers, so don't give me that answer. What I'm asking is:  Is there any hope for the future of Romania?
Good books on the Turkish Nat'l Movement, Ataturk, and the Turkish War of Independence? Hi there. I am interested in and would love some good book recommendations on this material, in either English or Spanish. Since it is a bit more obscure than some other things, I understand that I may need to read some bourgeois histories about it if I want to learn, but I'd obviously appreciate most some good Marxian historiography on the Turkish War of Independence and the Kemalists. I'm especially interested in their relationship with the international communist movement, both domestically and abroad. Thanks.
Looking for news podcast Hello, I am very disgusted with my usual news podcast, I have slowly been becoming less and less pleased with NPR’s up first in my morning commute.

Where can I read writings from Faina Savenkova? Good afternoon comrades. I've been interested in the history of Ukraine, Russia, and the surrounding nations & states due to the war. I have learned a good amount about Donbas and I heard of Faina Savenkova, a 13 year old girl targeted by a Ukranian website that's essentially a kill list because she wrote about her life in Donbas. However I could not find her actual writings. Does anyone know if they are published somewhere?
Historical-Materialist Approach to Postmodernism Dear Comrades,   I am writing an essay about the linguistic turn in anthropology during the 1980s. There is a specific way in which these thinkers (members of the Writing Culture Debate) frame their project in relation to postmodernism that is, in a way neither strictly post modernist and neither modernist. (Anyway I dont want to dive to deep into it, but feel free to ask if this is too vague or elusive)   My question: Can you recommend me any historical-materialist approaches that see post-modernism, and its academical and theoretical endeavours as an outcome( or somehow related) to the changing capitalist productions and technologies that were also emerging during this time (basically I mean a transition from an industrial to an information society). I am thinking of writers such as Fredric Jameson ("The Capitalist Logic of Postmodernism"), David Harvey  and Ernest Mandel. But also Franco Bifo Berardi comes to mind, but I dont know where to start with him.   Plz point me towards anything that tries to rehistorize (?) this time from a marxist or neo.marxist perspective.   Thank you in advance.   Yours digitalfisch
Brazil and its fash problem; [Guns, God, and Democracy in Brazil - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noP8sLB4LSY&list=WL&index=5)  So, I've watched this short from Vice after coming home from a workday where a 12 year-old Italo-Brazilian boy saluted my class with the N@zi salute. I teach philosophy at a private-owned Middle School in Southern Brazil (not for elites, but up-and-coming middle class families).  The region has 90% of its population composed by white Europeans (people with Italian, German, Polish, Ukrainian, and Iberian descent). This very same week, we saw a mass shooting in Espírito Santo State where a fash police officer's son attacked two different schools wearing camo, a .44 magnum, and a Swastik@ armband. He (16M) killed 4 people (three teachers and a 12-year-old student) and injured another 12 people.  Honestly, I'm writing this down trembling in anger. My whole class was in shock. I have a couple of black students and a young boy that is Jewish. This crazy 12-year-old did the Nazi salute in my class. When I asked if he knew what that meant, he smiled the most mischievous smile I have ever seen on a child and said, 'I like the man with the funny mustache'. With the entire class in shock, I called the coordinator/principal (a Bolsonaro's supporter) who said “don't take him out of class or comment on anything. Ignore him because his parents are trouble”.  The very same day, a public school in Minas Gerais state was invaded and vandalized with [swastik@s](mailto:swastik@s). Here some footage: [https://twitter.com/em\_com/status/1597570356898037761?t=qxUw7CQvOh4nz9vDq7D32g&s=19](https://twitter.com/em_com/status/1597570356898037761?t=qxUw7CQvOh4nz9vDq7D32g&s=19)  Now, Bolsonaro's mobs are attacking water supplies, claiming they will stage an attack during Lula's inauguration, and other stuff (like marking stores and shops belonging to PT's voters). Some context:  [Violence escalates in bolsonarist anti-democratic acts - 24/11/2022 - Brazil - Folha (uol.com.br)](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/internacional/en/brazil/2022/11/violence-escalates-in-anti-democratic-acts-and-authorities-investigate-terrorism.shtml)  This trend is not new at all. The rise of fash and neo-n@zism in Brazil is an old phenomenon. However, they are now starting to act, and the military are starting to public display support to this whole lunacy.  I do not know what to make of this. I wish the left was more organized and organic in Brazil. More disciplined, and less “New Age”. We are seeing them creating roots for a new right-wing movement, and people (on the left) still believe that the Liberal State will prevail.  This place has been a feverish dream for too damn long.

Even as an ML, I'm having a hard time explaining away the official death toll of Stalin's White Sea Canal project Official Soviet figures put the death toll between 12,000 and 25,000. Apparently this was because the process was rushed due to Stalin's eagerness to finish the five-year plan on time and have this grand symbol of development. Gulag inmates were apparently used and many died due to poor working conditions. Like I said, between 12k and 25k. Solzhenitsyn estimates up to 250k, which is obviously horseshit, but, if the official figures are 12k-25k, that's not a great sign, is it?  If this is true, it's pretty damning, no? Is there any reason to doubt these figures? Let me know with sources, please, if you do have any reason to distrust these figures. If these figures are true, it doesn't mean socialism or communism are bad, or that the U.S.S.R was inherently bad- all it does really is raise significant questions about Stalin's qualities as a leader. I'm not here to debate his moral qualities, because that's kind of silly, but if this is true, it throws Stalin's competence into question, which is a problem if you uphold Stalin like most MLs do. I'm not trying to be sectarian here, I consider myself an ML, I just want to hear different perspectives on this.
Looking for books/articles about workers rights under Stalin Especially during industrialization/collectivization
Where can I learn more about the 1989 Tiananmen Square Protests? I'm not at all educated on the subject, and I want to learn more about it! I'm also, I suppose, unsure of how to feel about certain aspects of the protests overall. I've seen on this subreddit a lot of conrades saying that there was no massacre, and I see others saying that it was blown way out of proportion (which I definitely see how the US would do that considering their long history). Not knowing a whole lot about it, and only being surrounded by liberal and imperialist propaganda, I find myself wanting learn more about the protests so I can understand the event more.  I'm a somewhat new leftist, and there are certain aspects that as I learn more about certain historical events, especially in China, I sometimes find myself having a hard time breaking free from what I've heard from liberal news sources and individuals. I know everyone on the sub will acknowledge that the CCP has had it's fair share of shortcomings, but that they have also made incredible progress in many areas as well. I guess I'm looking mostly for reading material, I love books. Videos are alright too. I've seen mostly articles get linked on other posts about this event, so I can probably go back to those sometime I suppose.   With everything going on these days regarding the protests in China right now, I'm seeing a lot more reactionaries and liberals draw comparisons to what's happening now and what allegedly happened in Tiananmen Square back in '89. I'm trying to learn more as a newbie here, but I'm definitely having a hard time figuring out where to start.

Sam Darcy interview, early-mid 1980s [https://digitaltamiment.hosting.nyu.edu/s/cpoh/item/3678](https://digitaltamiment.hosting.nyu.edu/s/cpoh/item/3678)  Sam Darcy was an early member and leader of the American Communist Party and the Comintern. Long an opponent of Earl Browder, he was finally expelled from the party during the war and never returned.  Here he talks about his experiences in his party years: the Comintern, Stalin, Browderism, electoral and extra-party union struggles, his time as California leader (during the SF general strike and Pacific waterfronters' strike), reactionary violence, etc.  This is not a work of theory, god knows, but there are several things which stick out and make Darcy a mirror-image of many modern "progressive intellectuals" even though he was an ex-communist (i.e. recognition of the bourgeois dictatorship in America, support for Stalin, recognition of the Moscow Trials' veracity, and firm opposition to Khrushchev even in the Reagan years, etc.). It's a pleasant surprise compared to the more widely-paraded image of Dorothy Healey and other blatant revisionists who founded the DSA or became fascists like Lovestone.
We should talk more about how workers would work on a Marxist-Leninst goverment. Its probably one of the most important thing to use as an way of atracting workers; Telling them how they could work, and how that would benefit them, and how that would be done. Its an very important thing that should be debated more but its sadly buried under hundreds of a lot more petty and infantile arguing. We should organize the most important documents and records of how worker decided how they would work in an socialist society, what the AES states did to help organizing said workers, what types of debates existed between workers, members of the communist partys, communist economists, etc.   We should talk about future land reeorganizations, what would be done to the capitalists wealth, how the goverment would react to problems like hunger, housing, public security, economy, trade, etc. What laws would be instated, what would be revoked, what types of projects would be started or aproved.  Just saying "just take the means of production lmao" is not convincing, we need to give well detailed instructions, actions and theories of what could be done so workers could have an well made and realistic concept of working on a society where they would be on power.   And the best way of doing all of this would be to search about what was done on socialist countries, records of said countries would be an good start, and actually talking with irl workers; Talking about their working conditions, their salaries, the working ambient on their jobs, if they have an home of their home or if they are being able of pay for housing, if they are heavily in-debt for bullshit reasons, if they have suffered abuse by the hands of the goverment or by their bosses. Talking about this stuff and giving them solutions is the best way of showing that we are on their side.
Will American leftists prevail against fascism? Will leftist ideas become more and more dominant and mainstream within the upcoming decades with regular working people? Or will American citizens shut out socialist ideas and continue to stick with the red/blue fake bs and even turn to fascism?
Do you guys know about Frédéric Lordon and/or Bernard Friot? French communist thinkers vs International They are two French thinkers of "communism" (quotes because they are quite unorthodox and might not fit here, even if they claim themselves from marxism ofc, and one of them has been a fervent French Communist Party member for years)  (a bit of an off-topic introducing and nuancing paragraph)  >!I'm still quite a neophyte in marxist theory, communist theory, as well as knowing the historical facts of USSR and all the stuff that is good to know. I've been lightly talking about politics on Twitter and I've stumbled upon the "international" or at least english-speaking communist people, and I've noticed a difference between the "French community" and the "international community". !<  >!Of course I guess there's also memeing, but I've seen appellations like "tankies", people acknowledging North Korea and saying "Stalin did nothing wrong", stuff like this. I'm still trying to find out who is just deluded and who is provoking my preconceptions rightly. This is funny because i'm pretty critical about everything, more and more, especially of the medias and dominant storytelling (ofc, especially with communism, dominant thought is skewed and biased). And even if I already wondered to what length the dominant story on Stalin and NK (for the worst examples) was true, I never really researched about it. I don't think they are "plain good guys" like some people try to make believe on Twitter tho.!<  So, yeah, as I was saying in the off-topic, I've noticed interesting differences of approach between the French commies and the "international" commies. Of course, there are also more orthodox or hardcore commies in France, but I feel like we don't talk about the same things. Most commies here in France (I think) acknowledge the USSR as a failure (during Stalin era at least), but as I said that could be they didn't research enough, it's still a sensitive subject here as well as with the nazis, all this era and the two blocks.  Anyways, as I got interested in French commies discussion, a lot were talking about Bernard Friot and Frédéric Lordon (obviously, French thinkers and not translated I think). Many of us think they are "important thinkers" of our school of thought in France.  I find it interesting that not many people talk about them on the international discourse. Of course, they are not translated (I think), but is there no amateur vulgarization that make it accessible in english?  **Basically, I was wondering if (some of) you had heard of them, or if you just dismissed their ideas because it was deemed not satisfying for you.**  **\_\_\_\_\_**  I'm not gonna go in length to introduce their ideas in here because the point of this post is more to say there seems to be some difference between French communist ideas and the world's, and ask if you knew about them.  But i'm still gonna introduce a bit if some might be interested.  **Bernard Friot** is a sociologist and economist, whose primary field is "labour economics". He is quite old, he worked on his field for a few decades already. His most popular writing is about our French model of social security, and its history, how it came to be, the reality of the struggle to install it at the end of the WW2, against the bourgeoisie, etc. His most popular "theory" is some kind of "model" of what a "communist" society could be, based on **what has been proven to work** in French social solidarity system, i.e. he claims that our civil servants (*fonctionnaire* in French) are in a circuit outside of the capitalist market, as their salary is based on their qualification (grade) and not on their productivity or current job.  It's a bit hard to explain (even if it seems easy at the same time) and i'm not sure to understand it fully myself so i don't want to explain bad, but basically he wants to reformulate the Universal Basic Income, which some people rightly call for being rightist (depending on how it is applied), for a "Salary for life", which is (could be more complicated i'm not 100% sure) changing the relation of the person to the income : an income recognize the person as a "being with needs" that is helped, a salary recognize the person as producing something and given in return.  Another big thing he says is that, "we already have some level of communism in France with those achievements from 1945", which might be considered daring for orthodox marxist I guess. Well, one of his core fight is  for the revenue to be separated from the activity at least, which is why some people mix his work with the UBI, even if it's subtly not the same.  Well there's a lot more to it but basically, now he is associated with this other guy, Frédéric Lordon, to try and create what they call "Figures of communism", in order to create a descriptive picture of a desirable communism, distant from the popular imagination of an authoritarian state and with a more "desirable" connotation.  Desirable, because **Frédéric Lordon** is an economist in the [school of Regulation Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_school), converted philosopher, inspired by Marx and Spinoza, he wrote a lot of stuff on capitalism and desire, invoking both of them. He notably wrote "Capitalism, desire and servitude", he also theorized something he calls "Recommon" (*Récommune* in French), based on "Republic" (res + publica, the public thing, res + commonia, the common thing), I don't really remember what it is about but it's a bit of a reformulation of communism twisted with the concept of republic, as the name says. He only accepted to use the term "communism" recently (a few years ago) as far as I know, because he admitted that even if the term was tarnished, it should be reconquered to have a positive signifiant to use against "capitalism", because you don't build adhesion on being "against" but "in favor".  Well, to finish with Lordon, he mainly developed on the theories of determinism and structures in Marxism, and as I said he theorized some stuff on communism and anarchism (unorthodox again), but now he is working with Bernard Friot to develop this "desirable communism" figure. An article in French about his thoughts (you can translate with DeepL, very good quality translator): [https://blog.mondediplo.net/pour-un-communisme-luxueux](https://blog.mondediplo.net/pour-un-communisme-luxueux)  &#x200B;  >**BTW: I said Lordon wasn't translated: he actually has two books in English, I'll put them here:**   >   >**Willing Slaves of Capital: Spinoza & Marx on Desire** [**http://libgen.rs/book/index.php?md5=36C88364EEB661819DB5D4AF4BFD315B**](http://libgen.rs/book/index.php?md5=36C88364EEB661819DB5D4AF4BFD315B)   >   >**Imperium: Structure and Affects of Political Bodies** [**http://libgen.rs/book/index.php?md5=DD23817BDF62F575A59799DCEDC8C15B**](http://libgen.rs/book/index.php?md5=DD23817BDF62F575A59799DCEDC8C15B)  &#x200B;  There are many interviews videos with them in French, I wanted to try and translate some in english in the future, tell me if it seems interesting or if it doesn't seem to talk to your commie soul.

Marxist Book on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics by Harpal Brar The main purpose of this post is to promote the work of Harpal Brar. A PDF of his book on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics can be downloaded here. Please download it immediately and if you are familiar with a better place to upload it then please do that. This is the first time a pdf of this book will be available on the internet as far as I can tell. I believe the book is essential reading for anyone trying to objectively understand China rather than doing the usual thing, which is starting from your preconceived beliefs about the country and working backwards to justify the conclusions you have already formed and are unwilling to change.  [https://www.dropbox.com/s/pn2hcu226m7d610/Socialism%20with%20Chinese%20Characteristics.pdf?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pn2hcu226m7d610/Socialism%20with%20Chinese%20Characteristics.pdf?dl=0)  [https://libgen.rs/book/index.php?md5=3503A37A567094AFF87CD2E5832A5DBE](https://libgen.rs/book/index.php?md5=3503A37A567094AFF87CD2E5832A5DBE)  To understand China you should also understand the global capitalist system as it exists today. For this I recommend starting with Sam King:  [https://red-ant.org/2022/09/10/the-imperialist-chokehold-over-china/](https://red-ant.org/2022/09/10/the-imperialist-chokehold-over-china/)  [https://vuir.vu.edu.au/37770/1/KING,%20Samuel%20-%20thesis\_nosignature.pdf](https://vuir.vu.edu.au/37770/1/KING,%20Samuel%20-%20thesis_nosignature.pdf)  Please read Sam King with the following in mind: One of the justifications of Socialism with Chinese Characteristics is that it was the only way for China to gain access to foreign technology. Additionally, from personal experience, I can tell you that many Chinese officials and professors tend to compare China to 19th century Germany and the United States. That is, they tend to think of China as a "late rising power" and "developing country". The implication is that it will progress through the stages of development to eventually become a "developed country".  The next step is to understand Soviet revisionism and how it affected China even before the Sino-Soviet split. The main article for this is here:  [https://revolutionarydemocracy.org/rdv12n2/shanghai.htm](https://revolutionarydemocracy.org/rdv12n2/shanghai.htm)  You can read Socialism Betrayed by Keeran which gives an overview of how revisionism developed in the USSR. The Political Economy Textbook by the USSR gives a good overview of political economy before economic theory was revised after the death of Stalin:  [https://www.marxists.org/subject/economy/authors/pe/index.htm](https://www.marxists.org/subject/economy/authors/pe/index.htm)  Also read the book Stalin himself wrote on economics:  [https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1951/economic-problems/index.htm](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1951/economic-problems/index.htm)  The main issue between the revisionists and anti-revisionists is the role of the law of value, money, and commodities in the building of socialism. This can be very abstract for someone who does not already have a strong grasp of Marx's economic theory. This is mainly covered in part 1 of Capital which is notoriously difficult to read. To fully grasp the theory of value I recommend Rubin:  [https://www.marxists.org/archive/rubin/value/](https://www.marxists.org/archive/rubin/value/)  To fully grasp Marx's theory of money I recommend Sam William's blog (read "Money as the Universal Equivalent" to "Money as a Means of Payment"):  [https://critiqueofcrisistheory.wordpress.com/money-as-the-universal-equivalent/](https://critiqueofcrisistheory.wordpress.com/money-as-the-universal-equivalent/)  If you are not at a level at which you understand the details of economic theory and the history of revisionism, then I could see how you could get hoodwinked by SWCC. This is especially true for those concerned with the development of the Third World and the alleviation of poverty. Some people may believe that anything negative about China from a Marxist perspective especially when referencing the commodity form and the law of value is being overly dogmatic. I would agree with this criticism if the justifications of SWCC held up to reality. If I genuinely believed that SWCC could turn China into a leading technologically-advanced, industrial power that could then nationalize industry and lead the entire proletarian movement as the USSR used to do, then I would not get into the details of Marxist theory and the history of revisionism. SWCC cannot do the things it promises and the sad truth is that many of its theoreticians are not Marxists in any sense of the word. That is to say they do not even call themselves Marxists. Many are economists who study neoclassical economics, cobble together a "development plan" based on a fundamentally anti-Marxist starting point, and then call the result Socialism with Chinese Characteristics. Justifications for this result are then found by eclectic "Marxists" by searching for quotes in the classics of Marxism-Leninism. These "Marxists" also have no understanding of revisionism as it developed in the 1950s. They tend to view the Sino-Soviet split as being fundamentally about power politics. The Sino-Vietnam war, support for Pol Pot, support for Pinochet etc. are all also erased from history as the Chinese "Marxists" tell it (despite the fact that they infuriatingly still uphold the "theory of three worlds" as correct). They almost always only use "imperialism" in the liberal sense of the word meaning colonization and direct aggression.  I believe that completely supporting the ideology propagated by China fundamentally requires ignorance of the history of revisionism and the economics of modern imperialism. If you bring up these topics and their logical conclusion, which is that the current development plan of China is fundamentally flawed (from the perspective of the proletariat as opposed to the interests of profit making for capitalists in China and elsewhere), Chinese "Marxists" have no idea how to respond. Marxism for them is exactly like catechisms, a series of dogmas to be recited on command. Marxism is not taught as an analytic tool whose purpose is to clarify the development of history in order to change the world for the better. It is rather taught as a series of memorized statements and definitions to be regurgitated for examinations then forgotten.  This post is getting too long. Later this year or early next year I hope to post a review of their official Marxist textbooks.
Increased British Military Activity in Occupied Ireland
Looking for books/articles/videos on understanding how fascism operates Hello, I am looking for books, articles, zines or videos on understanding how fascism operates and affects so many parts of (American) society. If it's a book, I would appreciate it if it was easier to read in terms of language and writing, and more of a newer book. I feel like we never really learned about fascism in school in the U.S. and because of this a lot of Americans have poor understandings of what fascism is. I read and seen some social media posts about how fascism uses or needs liberalism (thank you Assata Shakur's autobiography and @/abolish\_time on instagram). I also seen some videos about how fascism centers purity, and how this structures and perpetrates racism and fatphobia. Thank you in advance, a person trying to learn more about the world <3

I'm looking for quantitative info on how big the Nazi problem is within the Armed Forces of Ukraine and its paramilitary organizations. Hi, there. Currently, my position on the whole Ukrainian Nazi thing is that, while Putin is lying about invading Ukraine to "denazify" it, that being the case is not mutually exclusive with Ukraine having a serious Nazi problem. I think most of us here know that, in some way or another, this is the case. However, I recently heard in some video essay or written article, I forget, that Ukraine has 100,000 Nazis in its armed forces. Fascinated, I of course looked for a source, as I've never heard an actual estimate before. I found nothing. So, I am wondering if anyone here might have the source for that claim. If not, are there any quantitative claims for the strength of fascists within the Armed Forces of Ukraine and its paramilitaries. Thanks.
Lessons From Ngugi Wa Thiong’o For Us
Being a communist around the world  **Greetings, comrades!**  I am a Brazilian communist organized in the Young Communist Union (UJC), a Marxist-Leninist organization subordinated to the Brazilian Communist Party (PCB). Like many of the comrades here at the sub, I understood the need to organize myself as soon as I came into contact with Marxist-Leninist literature. I, from Brazil, find it difficult to analyze your reality. Therefore, I would like the organized comrades to answer some of my questions.  **What is it like to be organized in a communist organization in the United States?** I've never seen american communists waving red flags with communist symbols (sickle and hammer), nor wearing sickle and hammer shirts (not even MLs, I guess). **Why does it happen? How is it to have contact with the people on the streets as communists?**  These are questions addressed primarily to american comrades, but **EVERYONE** can answer if they want!  Hugs from Brazil. Hasta la victoria 🚩🔥

My online copy of das kapital changed and I’m lost I had been in the process of reading das kapital. I had bought it on Apple Books. I’ve been reading a chapter a day and there were previously roughly 1400 pages and I was roughly 900 pages in. I came home from work today and started to read again when I realized the book is now 1180 pages long and i was left off about 700 pages in on an unfamiliar chapter. Can anyone who is more familiar with the book tell me the proper length, also I remember the last chapter I read was quite long (about 200 pages) and he mostly talked about the difference between tools and machines and how the craftsman has total control of means of production but when machinery is involved the means is taken away and the worker becomes a tool in the industrial machine(to paraphrase) could anyone tell me what chapter this might be so I can find my place again.
