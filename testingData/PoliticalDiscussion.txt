A judge ruled that an abortion drug must no longer be approved by the FDA. What are the immediate and far reaching consequences of a judge intervening in an agency’s power in such way? A judge in Texas just ruled that a drug used for abortions must no longer be approved by the FDA.  The judge argued that the approval process of this drug did not take into account the lives of the unborn babies and that the FDA did not show sufficient benefits of this drug.    Responses to this ruling has been across the spectrum.  Individual republicans have praised the ruling but most republicans have been silent and one outwardly stating this ruling was wrong.  Democrats have universally condemned the ruling.  The primary criticisms state the ruling is unscientific and lacks medical understanding that gives this drug value.  They state that the ruling relies on fetal personhood legal thought which is not currently accepted in the US judicial system.  The ruling also disregards democrats other legal criticism, such as the fact that there exists a mechanism to remove drugs from the approved list already.  Within the wording, democrats criticize that the mentality behind the ruling, fetal personhood, lack of value of pregnancy termination, is also extremely out of touch with the public’s.  What are the immediate and far reaching consequences of this ruling?  Many democrats are concerned that this ruling greatly strengthens the judicial branch and drastically weakens the executive branch.  Will this enable other judges to strike down other politically sensitive drugs?  Will people feel emboldened to use this new judicial strength to further weaken other agencies as long as they can just find a judge who agrees with their opinion? How does stare Decisis or the lack thereof play in a role here?
Throwback to 2003: Did the US invade Iraq for its oil or is this still a conspiracy theory? The soldier in the linked video states that US invaded Iraq for its oil. Some negate this by stating that the invasion was a necessary action to prevent Saddam from controlling the oil reserves in the Middle East and thereby dethrone the dollar as currency.

Robert Kennedy Jr declared to run for President, but, can he actually mount a challenge to Biden? Who decides who can run in state primaries, I wasn't sure if it was the Democratic party in each state, at the national level, or is the process set out by the state government in each state? Robert Kennedy Jr declared to run for President, but, can he actually mount a challenge to Biden?  Who decides who can run in state primaries, I wasn't sure if it was the Democratic party in each state, at the national level, or is the process set out by the state government in each state?
Why did Hillary Clinton decide to run for President in 2008 and 2016, but not in 2004?  I remember talk, that if Gore had lost the 2000 Presidental election, then Hillary Clinton had a very good chance of getting the nomination in 2004. However, Clinton did not run in 2004, and Bush won. By the time 2008 hit, Obama had thrown his hat in the ring. and the much favored Clinton did not get the nomination in 2008. But why didn't she run in 2004, back before Obama was even a Senator, when the field seemed very much wide open, could she had gotten the nomination? And if she did, could she have gotten elected over George W. Bush?
Polls repeatedly show that the vast majority of Americans on both sides think there is too much money in politics, why can nothing be done? There is a laundry list of polls that show that Democrats, Republicans, Independents all think there is too much money in politics. Yet there never seems to be any legislation on campaign finance or lobbying, and candidates that focus on these issues never seem to get any attention. But this is one thing that people from all areas of the political spectrum can agree on. Why can nothing be done?  Here are just a few polls that show this:    [Most Americans want to limit campaign spending | Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/05/08/most-americans-want-to-limit-campaign-spending-say-big-donors-have-greater-political-influence/)    [New Poll Shows Money in Politics Is A Top Voting Concern - Issue One](https://issueone.org/articles/new-poll-shows-money-in-politics-is-a-top-voting-concern/)    [Americans’ Views on Money in Politics - The New York Times (nytimes.com)](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/06/02/us/politics/money-in-politics-poll.html)    [Despite public's concern, more money than ever flows into campaigns | Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/12/07/as-more-money-flows-into-campaigns-americans-worry-about-its-influence/)
Who do you think has the highest chance of beating Trump and DeSantis in the 2024 GOP Primaries? Currently, former President Donald Trump and current Governor of Florida Ron DeSantis are dominating the Republican primary field. Their combined polling totals average out to be over 80%, with Trump usually polling at around 50% and DeSantis at around 30%. In a distant third is usually former Vice President Mike Pence, in the mid to high single digits. This all begs the question, can a darkhorse candidate emerge and compete with the likes of Trump and DeSantis?  Besides Trump, the other three major candidates who've declared so far are Nikki Haley, Vivek Ramaswamy, and Asa Hutchinson. Other political leaders who are considering running include the aforementioned Mike Pence, as well as Mike Pompeo, Tim Scott, John Bolton, Larry Elder, Francis Suarez, and Chris Sununu.  None of those people, declared or not, have recently polled double digits, but perhaps a strong debate performance in August could change that? Nearly every election cycle, a previously unknown darkhorse candidate emerges and does fairly well. In 2020 it was Pete Buttigieg, in 2016 it was Bernie Sanders, in 2008 it was Ron Paul, and to some degree Barack Obama as well. What Republican do you think has the best chance of truly compete with Trump and DeSantis?
What other Democrats do you think will challenge Biden? First off, I should clarify that its extremely unlikely that if Joe Biden runs in 2024, that he'll loose in the primary, or that any mainstream Democrats will try and run against him. However, that has stopped somewhat well known but nonetheless "fringe" members of the party from from declaring their bids to run against him. Most notably, Marianne Williamson and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have entered the field.  Its unlikely that either of them will generate much support in the primaries, however, New Hampshire is currently going against the wishes of the DNC and planning to hold their Democratic primary in January, before South Carolina. The DNC has stated that President Biden's name won't be on the ballot in New Hampshire in January, which means its possible (definitely not guaranteed though) that they could have a primary without Biden, and one of the fringe candidates could win New Hampshire as the first state of the primary field, which of course would generate a ton of publicity for their campaign.  In light of this possibility, more fringe candidates are bound to enter the primary field, after all its only April. Possible candidates could include Tulsi Gabbard, Joe Manchin, Nina Turner, Andrew Yang, Tim Ryan, and others. Granted, there's a lot a speculation that comes with predicting Biden's potential challengers because of the fact that mainstream members of the party are very unlikely to challenge him, meaning its really gonna be politicians who are currently out of the public's eye. That aside though, who do you think might challenge Biden?
Why do you think the Founders added the Second Amendment to the Constitution and are those reasons still valid today in modern day America? What’s the purpose of making gun ownership not just allowable but constitutionally protected?  And are those reasons for which the Second Amendment were originally supported still applicable today in modern day America?   Realistically speaking, if the United States government ruled over the population in an authoritarian manner, do you honestly think the populace will take arms and fight back against the United States government, the greatest army the world has ever known? Or is the more realistic reaction that everyone will get used to the new authoritarian reality and groan silently as they go back to work?   What exactly is the purpose of the Second Amendment in modern day America? Is it to be free to hunt and recreationally use your firearms, or is it to fight the government in a violent revolution?
How likely is war with China? Forgive me if this is a redundant post, but I checked this sub’s history, and I don’t believe it is.   I’ve always said the only condition I would join the military under is if the US went to war with China. This is starting to look increasingly likely. Since the beginning of 2023, there have been articles in the NYT and NYP and TIME magazine ran a quote from General Mike Minihan (though these claims were not backed by the Pentagon) claiming that he believed war with China would come by 2025.   With this being the case, I’m curious, for both my own future, and the country’s- how likely do you think a war with China is? How is the situation, especially considering their relationship with Taiwan, likely to develop? Does anybody have any clear idea, or are we all just spitting in the wind about whether it will happen at all? I’d appreciate thoughts on this.
What “Countermeasures” Do You Speculate Putin Will Initiate In Response To Finland’s Induction To NATO? It appears Putin hadn’t been expectant of Finland’s recent induction into NATO, hypothetically with Sweden and Finland secured by Article V Putin’s offensive navigation is constricted.  What are potential variables and facets of this circumstance that are being overlooked?  What are likely conclusions?
A Texas Republican judge has declared FDA approval of mifepristone invalid after 23 years, as well as advancing "fetal personhood" in his ruling. [A link to a NYT article on the ruling in question.](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/07/health/abortion-pills-ruling-texas.html)  [Text of the full ruling.](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23746119-read-texas-federal-judge-ruling-on-abortion-pill)  In addition to the unprecedented action of a single judge overruling the FDA two decades after the medication was first approved, his opinion also includes the following:  >Parenthetically, said “individual justice” and “irreparable injury” analysis also arguably applies to the unborn humans extinguished by mifepristone – especially in the post-Dobbs era  When this case inevitably advances to the Supreme Court this creates an opening for the conservative bloc to issue a ruling not only affirming the ban but potentially enshrining fetal personhood, effectively banning *any* abortions nationwide.  1) In light of this, what good faith response could conservatives offer when juxtaposing this ruling with the claim that abortion would be left to the states?  2) Given that this ruling is directly in conflict with a [Washington ruling](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23746135-read-federal-judge-in-washington-state-says-fda-cannot-withdraw-mifepristone) ordering the FDA to maintain the availability of mifepristone, is there a point at which the legal system irreparably fractures and red and blue states begin openly operating under different legal codes?
In the wake of reporting that Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas was treated to luxury vacations by a ultra-wealthy Republican Donor, how should ethics on the Supreme Court evolve and what should occur with Thomas himself? Recently ProPublica reported that [Clarence Thomas benefited from numerous undisclosed vacations and private jet flights](https://www.propublica.org/article/clarence-thomas-scotus-undisclosed-luxury-travel-gifts-crow) from billionaire Republican Donor Harlan Crow.  Among the revelations are that Clarence Thomas:  * Flew numerous times on Crow's private jet, including day trips where renting an equivalent plane himself would have cost tens of thousands of dollars.  * Went on free vacations to Indonesia, New Zealand, Crow's private resort in upstate New York, the Bohemian Grove in California, and Crow's ranch in Texas, among other not yet reported on trips.  * Accepted gifts from Crow including a Douglass Bible worth $19,000, a portrait painted of Thomas and his wife, and a bust of Lincoln valued at $15,000 from the [AEI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Enterprise_Institute) a conservative group that includes [Crow on its the board of Trustees](https://www.aei.org/about/board-of-trustees/).  Other potential ethics concerns are that [Crow donated $500,000 to a Tea Party group founded by Ginni Thomas](https://www.politico.com/story/2011/02/justice-thomass-wife-now-lobbyist-048812) (Clarence Thomas' wife) and $105,000 to the "Justice Thomas Portrait Fund" at Yale Law School.  So, in light of this reporting:  Is Clarence Thomas' failure to disclose these gifts of travel and vacation activities an serious ethics violation?  If so what should be done with regards to Thomas and his future on the Supreme Court?  If not/otherwise what should happen with ethics in regards to Supreme Court Justices?
To what extent is Barack Obama directly responsible for the decimation of the Democratic bench during his presidency? In 2008, Obama came in with a senate supermajority, allowing him to pass effectively anything he wanted, given that he had enough support from the party. He used this to pass Obamacare, which caused him to suffer major midterm losses.  A lot of this could be considered thermostatic reaction, however, changes in the party’s focus from the local level to the national level also caused a lot of problems.  In many ways there are current mirrors in the way that Trump affects his party, but like Obama, the base oftentimes refuses to accept that the leaders themselves often caused issues.  Basically, while thermostatic opinion is to be expected, I want to determine how presidents affected this. Is it polarization, areas of the map falling off due to demographics, the party apparatus itself, or some combination of both?
If Trump Somehow Happens To Win The 2024 Presidential Election, What Would Be The Outcome? Let’s say that Trump wins 2024 in a landslide against Biden for some reason. It could be due to a recession, the indictment fails somehow, or even election interference being successful this time. Just imagine if he actually wins, even with high voter turnout for votes against him. Other than the “end of democracy” and “massive protests”, what else could happen? Never underestimate the power of the electoral college.
Should the US ban or strictly regulate the purchase of US property by Chinese investors and companies? Given that tensions between the US and China are rising on multiple fronts and that numerous sources with varying degrees of credibility often predict there is a high likelihood of direct conflict between the two countries in the semi-immediate future (semi-immediate as in the next five to ten years), I find it strange that there seems to be little attention paid to the fact that Chinese investors and companies have been purchasing large amounts of US property. For example, the National Association of Realtors (NAR) reported in 2022 that Chinese Investors accounted for $6.1 billion dollars in home purchases, totaling over 10% of the market between April 2021 and March 2022.   Should the US pass some sort of legislation that bans or strictly regulates the purchase of property by Chinese companies and investors? Why or why not?  **Edit(s):**  -My question wasn’t intended to pertain to private individuals who purchase property whatsoever, only corporations or individual investors who might be openly or discreetly acting on behalf of Chinese corporations/the CCP.   -From my understanding, the bulk of the properties purchased are not residential properties. It seems that the properties are often parcels that produce agricultural goods on an industrial scale or contain valuable natural resources.   -Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas recently proposed a ban, but I doubt it would withstand legal scrutiny as it very explicitly targeted companies based upon their nationality. I just found it to be an interesting dilemma and I don’t know enough to have a real opinion. It is just that given our current relationship with China, I wanted to see how other people might feel about it.
Does the Republican Party in America have a future? We have seen that republicans haven’t won a popular vote since bush. Polling shows Americans are surprisingly progressive on most issues - from gay marriage to abortion rights to paid parental leave - despite the political divide most Americans lean left on many issues.  Then we look at Gen Z - one of the most politically active generations - overwhelmingly vote Democrat. Conservatives have very little influence on gen Z, and millennials are the first generation to not become significantly conservative with age. The right wing base is made up of older generations - that are gradually  dying out - Gen Z’s political influence is getting stronger.  And I’m not even mentioning how controversial and disliked figures like Donald Trump Lauren Boebert Matt Gaetz and MTG are. I don’t even think the most left wing politicians are nearly as disliked by the public or controversial as these people are - despite politics being incredibly messy these days.  And I’m not even mentioning the midterms, or the WI Supreme Court election.   I mentioned all of this not just because it’s common knowledge - but I genuinely can’t think of a single advantage republicans have when it comes to the longevity of their party. It seems to me the republicans party is slowly but surely dying.  Do you agree? Do you believe the Republican Party has a dim future compared to the Democrats based off what I mentioned? Or do you believe that is not the case and will provide an opposing viewpoint, I’d be interested in hearing that as well.  Do you see republicans winning a presidential election in the future? Where do you see the senate and house races going?
What could a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia potentially look like? Of course this depends a lot about how the armed part of the fighting ends and what each side has to bargain with.  We actually have improved on the Treaty of Versailles in a number of ways. Russia´s borders before 2014 were not in much dispute. The League of Nations the treaty in 1919 had has been replaced with the UN which is more comprehensive and long-since established, and it has at least kept the conflict from spilling over outside of Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine itself where the First World War did spill over at a rapid rate. Most of Russia´s best weapons have been destroyed, and what is left is not in a good position to trigger any other war.   Maybe Ukraine builds a border wall like they and Poland already did with Belarus and peacekeepers can be sent to patrol a demilitarized zone for say 30 km east of the Russian-Ukrainian border as it stood before 2014 and Russian peacekeepers replaced with others in places like Armenia, Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and Transnistria.  Russia already did sign and ratify the UN Charter and the Geneva Conventions and several protocols, so the jurisdiction of anyone prosecuting someone for war crimes is in less doubt than there would have been 100 years ago as to whether you can hang the Kaiser, and the means to repatriate POWs and anyone abducted from Ukraine or who left of their own accord for any reason we already have practice with in recent treaty-making and jurisprudence. And there is no conflict with a bunch of other powers that have to be resolved independently the way the Treaty of Brest Litovsk had to be dealt with as did Trianon, St Germaine, Lausanne, and others had to be, only Belarus and the UN as a collectively would have to be involved as a third party.   We also have some precedent for reparations in the modern day with Kuwait being paid a sum of money, mainly from Iraq´s oil revenues, per year until the reparations were over, with a control commission established by a security council resolution to enforce it, the International Court of Justice and the UN General Assembly has voted on several instances as to the illegitimacy of the invasion which were ignored setting up the reason why such an invasion would be deemed illegal, and we have better economic data and courts to judge how badly damaged Ukraine was in all this and who could be entitled to what, and how to structure it so as not to cause a financial panic in Russia the way Germany had in 1923.   Perhaps also a supervisory commission might be made to observe Russian elections and some aspects of mandating freedom of expression, a free press, limiting corruption, and likewise for a period of time that would make democracy stronger in Russia. The world now has good experience in supervising this, which can help to avoid the kinds of decisionmaking processes that made Russia´s government more likely to attack in the first place.
Tennessee Republicans expelled 2 Democrats for protesting gun legislation (they almost got 3). This is only the 3rd time since the Civil War that the Tennessee House expelled lawmakers. 2 of the 3 lawmakers who protested were expelled, and the third dodged the expulsion by one vote.  If the precedent is set that lawmakers can expel politicians who disagree with them, what do you think this means for our democracy?
In a recent policy reversal, the Biden administration will now allow schools to bar trans athletes from competitive sports. Does the admin see this as a losing issue with voters? In the past the Biden administration's position was that Title IX unequivocally protected gender identity, but new guidelines issued this week would allow schools to bar trans athletes in some instances.  This comes as polling shows a majority of Americans oppose allowing transwomen to compete in women's sports, and Republicans have made the issue a prominent part of their platform.  This recent change in policy comes despite support for trans rights being a prominent tenet among those in the Democrat's base. Is the Biden team conceding that this is a losing issue for the party? What does this say about trans issues going forward?
If you were a gov. Ron DeSantis advisor, what would be the best way to frontally attack Trump to win the GOP nomination? In this scenario, put on your political analyst hat, not your partisan hat.  It's become clear that DeSantis has slipped vs Trump in the polls. Once, they were near parity and now, Trump has a decent to sizable lead over DeSantis. However, the contest for the Republican presidential nomination is still early and DeSantis hasn't yet announced his candidacy.  Assume that DeSantis gets in the race and that the contours of the race are largely a one-on-one with Trump. If you advised the governor, what do you think would be the best way to confront Trump directly? It's clear DeSantis or anyone else can't beat him by obliquely alluding to his many political defects, especially in the general election. He must do it directly or he shouldn't run against him in the first place.  If I were offering DeSantis advice on how to take down Trump, it wouldn't be as a Never-Trumper critic--blasting him for being unfit, corrupt, etc.--or not right wing enough--wobbly on abortion--but a combination of being a loser, backing losers, and by being a dupe to the Establishment RINOs/Deep State who while president failed to enact an agenda aimed at the "forgotten" middle class. (That doesn't mean just accusing him of failing to "build the wall")  DeSantis shouldn't downplay his anti-woke agenda, but he needs some policy meat that directly affects the lives of Trump's "Rust-belt" base of supporters. Here, DeSantis can go populist and show he's not beholden to the "donor" class/libertarian downsize government ethos of the Tea Party era.
Bolsonaro testifies to Brazilian investigators in the Saudi jewelry scandal, guilty, or innocent? Brazil’s former President Jair Bolsonaro gave a statement to the Federal Police on Wednesday regarding USD $3.2 million in jewelry he and his wife received as a gift from the government of Saudi Arabia back in 2021.  [https://brazilreports.com/bolsonaro-testifies-to-brazilian-investigators-in-saudi-jewelry-scandal/4406/](https://brazilreports.com/bolsonaro-testifies-to-brazilian-investigators-in-saudi-jewelry-scandal/4406/)  Bolsonaro arrived at the Federal Police headquarters in Brasília just before 2:30 PM in an unmarked vehicle, and his conversation with investigators, accompanied by his lawyers,  lasted about three hours.  Investigators are trying to determine whether the former president committed the crime of embezzlement, which is characterized in Brazil by a public official appropriating money or assets because of the position of power he/she occupies, reported O Globo. The crime carries a punishment of two to 12 years in prison.
Why not make state electors (in the Electoral College) proportional to votes in the state? Over the year’s many politicians have advocated to abolish the Electoral College. However doing this would require a constitutional amendment. Would changing the way electors are selected based on the amount of votes in the states be feasible alternative to avoiding situations where the popular vote winner is different from the Electoral College winner?
What will be the central issues in the coming 2024 election? Sadly I think that abortion will be a central issue, but healthcare will fall even further behind than it did in the middle of a pandemic. What are some other issues you see as being central to any campaign? College debt has been getting worse, not better and again it seems like another issue falling behind while getting worse. AI is trendy and it has some people worried. Obviously the economy is always a big deal, taxes but those are going to fall along party lines. They are issues that will be discussed but you are going to be either on the conservative side or the liberal side so it is never a deciding issue in my opinion. The conservatives and liberals just get more hardened in their positions rather than jumping sides or casting their vote differently because of a proposed economic or tax plan.   What say you, what will they be debating this time around?
What is a red line for you, that if a candidate crosses it, you won't vote for them? Maybe the candidate in question has good economic views to you, perhaps shares a similar foreign policy view like you, but he or she supports position x and because of that you can't vote for them.  What is that position for you?  What is your red line that a candidate can't cross for you and why?
Will Republicans suffer politically from Trump and his allies calling for defund the police? Trump has repeatedly called to “defund the FBI and DOJ” over the charges and investigations against him. House republican leaders have echoed these calls.  https://mobile.twitter.com/RepMTG/status/1643784805283184640  Do republicans risk being painted as the “soft on crime” party, in a reversal of traditional conventional wisdom where the right wing party is known for being “tough on crime”?
Why did so many famous thinkers think lowly of democracies vs republics? Upate: Ooops! I took out the quote by Alexander Fraser Tytler because it was too extreme and not in agreement with my beliefs. I was busy and that's what happens when you're in too much of a hurry.  I added: "People electing people to make the laws as opposed to people making and taking the law into their own hands. Constitutional Republic vs (direct) Democracy mob rule" me  Update 2: Yeah I know many use the term democracy to mean representative democracy, which is wrong because when you get down to it, many manipulators also use it to mean direct democracy or pure democracy which turns into "people making and taking the law into their own hands." And nowadays many are often calling for that, saying it's democracy (but really wanting direct democracy), which is dangerous to our republic and yes leads to anarchy. This is how the public is manipulated into thinking democracy means direct democracy over representative democracy.  \----------------------------  Our leadership, media and even schools refer to us as a democracy, which is false since we are a republic based on democratic principles. Is the illusion kind of a goal of what we want to be? While many groups like to say in a democracy... or democracy now! On the other hand most republics are centered around various checks and balances to avoid slipping into an autocracy, e.g. due process, miranda rights, day in court, free speech - especially the media... And of course some just call themselves by that term but don't really practice it.  But what did some of the greatest minds in history think about democracy vs republic. Take for instance our 2nd president who had a different idea about it:  “Remember, democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. There never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide.” John Adams, our 2nd President.  And why did President Adams say that? Perhaps this quote by Bovard explains it:  “Democracy must be something more than two wolves and a sheep voting on what to have for dinner.” ― James Bovard, American libertarian author and lecturer.  "People electing people to make the laws as opposed to people making and taking the law into their own hands. Constitutional Republic vs Democracy mob rule" me  &#x200B;  Finally let's not forget Socrates and the mob:  And why did Socrates hate democracy?  "Socrates ... witnessed what amounted to an angry mob illegally putting generals to death on his watch. Then, of course, a jury decided by a slim majority to put him to death on flimsy charges. Plato tells us that a mere 30 votes, out of a jury of 500, killed him."  Holy jumping, smelly armadillos!  (I had posted this inside another post as a response but thought this is in depth enough to stand by itself.)
How did Brandon Johnson win? Going into the Chicago Mayoral race, much was made about Crime and a perceived softness on crime for Democrats. This narrative was supported by a [supposed lead in the polls](https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/chicago-mayoral-poll-paul-vallas-brandon-johnson/3110228/) that Paul Vallas enjoyed up until the election.   [But on Tuesday, Primary Candidate Brandon Johnson triumphed over Paul Vallas](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/04/04/us/elections/results-chicago-mayor-runoff.html). Who and where was his coalition in Chicago made up of?     Also what does this say about crime as a supposed albatross for Democrats and potential wedge issue for Republicans?
Left equivalent of Marjorie Taylor Greene? Marjorie Taylor Greene (MTG) has been the congress person for the 14th Congressional District in Georgia since 2021. Since then, she’s managed to stay in the news, at first for promoting QAnon theories and more recently for appearing on *60 Minutes*, where she  repeatedly called Democrats pedophiles.   A list of the theories and ideas she’s promoted is on the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene), but they include the notion that Ukraine started the war with Russia, that red states should secede from blue states, that the US government is planning to force Americans to eat fake meat … and so on.   My question is this: is there a truly left equivalent of MTG?   I know that some conservatives might suggest that Sanders, AOC, and perhaps even Biden are the left equivalent. If that is your argument, please back up with quantitative and qualitative citations.    If there is not an equivalent, why not? And if such an equivalent existed, what views would they hold, and would that person also be granted as much media exposure as MTG receives?  As a bonus follow up question: does having a figure like MTG open the Overton window and is therefore beneficial to the GOP? Does or would that same strategy would for the Left?
Is there a scenario where Trump wins the Republican primary and then goes to prison? We know the New York indictments went to arraignment yesterday, and he has more criminal indictments likely to be handed down in the future including those from Georgia regarding the election fraud claims.   Given the timeline of the US primaries (winners likely concluded by next summer) and the length of time it can take court cases to unfold, it seems like there's a chance he could both win the primary and be sentenced to prison if found guilty of criminal charges.   What would happen then?
Discussing a strengthening of BRICS and what it means for western political dominance & US hegemony   BRICS the economic alliance formed in 2001 between Brazil, Russia, India, & China. BRICS has developed into a geopolitical alliance of developed nations, mirroring the G7, and just recently eclipsed the G7 in collective GDP (not to be confused with per capita GDP).   BRICS has been fostering its influence in the developing world, building trade partnerships, develop infrastructure, and economic growth, seperated from western influence. The New Development Bank [a BRICS alternative to the World Bank] has been working on creating sustainable development, funding development models that work for developing nations rather than hold them in poverty.   Notably the recent peace negotiations between KSA & Iran, have led to both countries moving to join BRICS, and oil trade opening up outside of the USD standard. Japan, a staunch US all also has started buying oil through the BRICS networks. Could we be seeing in real time the end of the petro-dollar that has allowed the US to fund it's endless wars? Is Europe next to join trade with BRICS, after the fiasco of the NORD stream sabotage, its affects on European imports, and implications the US was behind it?   Effectively a parallel world economy has been created with the deliberate intention to sidestep western oversight and political power plays. Obviously this does not come without its controversy. BRICS has been facilitating Russian oil and energy trade throughout the controversial Ukraine war. China provides overwhelmingly the largest individual share of capital and investment weight, meaning a larger political voice at the table. The human rights record, and institutional corruption among member states has also raised concern. Notably Vijay Prashad, author and the Edward Said Chair at the American University of Beirut, 2014 raised the BRICS limitations as a political and economic "locomotive of the South" because they follow neoliberal policies. They have established neither new counter-balancing institutions nor come up with an alternative ideology.  More to the discussion at hand, what does this mean for the current international dynamic of western political dominance and US hegemony? Could this parallel BRICS parallel political and economic infrastructure mean a peaceful transition, effectively sidestepping US relevance without conflict? What other thoughts and concerns do you have?
What does the Democratic win in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race tell us about the current and future political landscape? https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/wisconsin-supreme-court-election-liberals-win-majority-rcna77190  Today the Democrats have scored a win in the Wisconsin Supreme Court election, flipping the 4-3 majority away from the conservatives for the first time since 2008.   Obviously this has a large implication for the state itself. Most notably, this will be crucial in the fight over the state's abortion access which was central to the campaign. Another point not to be missed will be the courts ability to get rid of the states extreme Republican gerrymander.   This will certainly be a boon to Democrats in upcoming state elections, but is this yet another sign that Republicans attacks on abortion rights has been causing significant and unending blowback, especially in the Rust Belt? How are candidates like Desantis going to view this especially as a 6 week abortion ban makes its way to his desk?  Are these special/off year election results also a sign that the Democratic party is capturing more and more educated voters?   If you were a Republican strategist, how would you approach 2024 with these results in mind?
As Finland joins NATO, what is the future of the alliance and Russia's relationship with Finland? Today [Finland was formally accepted into NATO](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/04/04/world/russia-ukraine-war#nato-welcomes-finland-as-a-member-in-a-power-shift-spurred-by-the-ukraine-war), marking the 9th enlargement of the alliance. Finland's decision comes in the wake of Russia's aggressive invasion of Ukraine and Russian warnings that it would damage Russian-Finnish relations.  So, what does NATO gain with Finland's new membership?  How will Russia respond to any new deployments of material or troops from NATO allies within Finland?  Does Finland's (and Sweden's) decision to join NATO signify a new lack of trust in Russian intentions and refute allegations from pro-Russia commentators that Finland would be better served remaining neutral?
How likely is it for a Republican candidate to win in the 2024 election? I'm European, never been to America but I do keep in touch with the media. What I have observed is that the US is very divided politically, and it seems like Republican support is rising nationwide. I'm not a specialist nor the most informed person on US politics. How likely is it for Trump or another Republican to win?
Why is it so rare to call America a Republic in colloquial terms when places like France are commonly called the French Republic or Russia called the Russian Federation or Venice a Republic? Especially given that this is usually one of the things the Americans tend to be proud of the most, and what people always bring up whenever someone challenges the electoral college too. Confusion with the two political parties, one historic and one current, of a similar name?
In the midst of such a tumultuous political landscape, what does your ideal vision of the United States of America look like? I apologize to international members on the restrictive nature of this question, but am eager to hear your opinions as well. Americans are just as likely to offer opinions on foreign nations, so why not welcome the reverse? But with 40 something percent membership from American viewers this questions is largely directed towards people currently living inside the United States, wether citizens or not.   What does your ideal vision of “the land of the free, and home of the brave”…..  What does that America look like?!
How well do you think a Hogan/Manchin Ticket would perform in the general election? So recently, there's been a lot of buzz about a group called "No Labels" which is a recently developed centrist political organization that aims to put a unity ticket on the ballot. A centrist Republican or Democrat for President and a centrist Republican or Democrat for Vice President. One idea that's been talked about a lot in relation to No Labels is a Larry Hogan/Joe Manchin ticket, so this begs the question, how well would they actually do in the general election? Or more broadly, how well would a high tier unity ticket of any kind do in the general election?  You can pick either to lead the ticket, but the question is this, would a unity ticket be able to generate a large amount of votes? Would they win states like Maryland or West Virginia? Would they poll above 15% and make the debates? Would they break Perot's 19% number from 1992? What do you all think?
NY indictment unsealed; they consist of 34 felony counts. Nonetheless, some experts say these charges are weaker than what is expected to come out of Georgia criminal investigation, and one being developed by the DOJ. Based on what we know so far, could there be some truth to these assertions? All the charges in the Manhattan, NY criminal case stems from hush money reimbursements to Michael Cohen \[Trump's then former private attorney\] by the then President Donald Trump to keep sexual encounter years earlier from becoming public.  There are a total of 34 counts of falsifying business records; Trump thus becomes the first former president in history to face criminal charges. The former president pleaded not guilty to all 34 felony charges. \[Previously, Trump vowed to continue his 2024 bid and is slated to fly back to Florida after the arraignment and speak tonight at Mar-a-Lago.\] Trump did not make any comments to the media when he entered or exited the courthouse.  Background: The Manhattan DA’s investigation first began under Bragg’s predecessor, Cy Vance, when Trump was still in the White House. It relates to a $130,000 payment made by Trump’s to Michael Cohen to Daniels in late October 2016, days before the 2016 presidential election, to silence her from going public about an alleged affair with Trump a decade earlier. Trump has denied the affair.  \[Cohen was convicted of breaking campaign finance laws. He paid porn actress Stormy Daniels $130,000 through a shell company Cohen set up. He was then reimbursed by Trump, whose company logged the reimbursements as legal expenses.\]  Some experts have expressed concerns that the New York case is comparatively weaker than the anticipated charges that may be brought by the DOJ and state of Georgia.  For instance, the potential charges being considered by DOJ involving January 6, 2021 may include those that were recommended by the Congressional Subcommittee.  18 U.S.C. 2383, insurrection; 18 U.S.C. 1512(c), obstruction of an official proceeding; and 18 U.S.C. 371, conspiracy to defraud the United States government. It is up to DOJ as to what charges would be brought.

Why have Recent Republican VPs had Trouble Getting to the Presidency? Historically, most Vice Presidents either become President or put up a solid effort. But looking at the last few Republican VPs, this hasn't been the case.  Going in order, first we've got Mike Pence. Its possible that he'll run in 2024, but all polls have him in single digits, trailing far behind Trump and DeSantis. Next we have Dick Cheney, who never even ran for President, which is a very unusual decision for Vice Presidents. Then there's Dan Quayle, who ran in 2000 but dropped out before the primaries after failing to gain traction. Then there's George H.W. Bush, who is the lone exception in this list of GOP VPs, but was also only a one-termer. If you want to go back even further, none of the next three Republicans Vice Presidents; Nelson Rockefeller, Gerald Ford, and Spiro Agnew were ever elected President either. Granted, Rockefeller died before he really had an open shot, and Ford while never elected President ended up there via the Nixon resignation. Now looking at former Democrat VPs, Joe Biden is the current President, Al Gore was the 2000 Democratic nominee, Walter Mondale was the 1984 Democratic nominee, and Hubert Humphrey was the 1968 Democratic nominee.  The odd thing about all this is that although the Republican Vice Presidents have had little success in getting to the oval office, the same can not be said for the party at large. For decades now, there's been a trend of not having two of the same party Presidents in a row. Biden's a Democrat, Trump's a Republican, Obama's a Democrat, Bush's a Republican, Clinton's a Democrat, etc. And also, at least one house of Congress flips almost every midterm cycle. My point being, the poor success rate for GOP VPs seems to be an anomaly, and I can't figure out the reason for it. What do you all think?
Is Netanyahu doing lasting damage to the U.S.-Israel relationship?  President Biden, a staunch supporter of Israel who had privately warned  Bibi (as the prime minister is known) to end his assault on the  judiciary, issued his strongest public condemnation of the move last  Tuesday. “I’m very concerned,” he said. “They cannot continue down this  road.” He urged “some genuine compromise.” As a sign of his displeasure,  he made it clear that Netanyahu won’t be invited any time soon to the  White House, where Israeli prime ministers have been regular visitors.
What exactly is built-into Russia's centuries-old historical Orthodox culture that makes its political value system different from the democratic values of Europe and the west? Many political historians including Samuel Huntington and Francis Fukuyama noted that Russian Orthodox culture is distinct from Europe, and that Russian culture was built from the remnants of Byzantine culture.  Huntington's Clash of Civilizations notes how Russia missed out on most of the key events that shaped Europe and the west, including Feudalism, the Enlightenment, Protestant Revolution, and other critical historical events. This separation in experience has shaped distinctive world views. But in addition to this, it's specifically the Orthodox value system I'm interested in better understanding as it relates to political values. For example, while these may seem obvious to some, has it bred an adherence to authoritarian thinking? A distrust of scientific thinking? An abhorrence towards an egalitarian value system? These are just some examples.  But as a westerner with only limited exposure to Russia, I really can't appreciate the difference in values. What are these differences, and in particular how do they create a political world view which contrast with western political values?
Should Biden pardon Trump? I'm not too familiar with the actual process of presidential pardons, but I think Ford pardoned Nixon long before it reached any sort of criminal court type of case. If Biden were to pardon Trump, would it cool tensions? Should he even do that?  In some ways I feel like this current situation involving Trump consist of remnants of arguments around Nixon when it comes to if the president is above the law or has avenues around it.   I'm just curious about this idea and I haven't had much luck searching for this theoretical idea online. Any thoughts or corrections about my assumptions would be much appreciated.
Is it possible for a political candidate to run completely off of free press? I’ve been thinking a lot about all the political ads that attack other candidates, and I don’t know many people who actually like those commercials.  In today’s social climate, all it takes is one article or one video for something to blow up. Do you think a candidate could replicate a Mr. Beast like campaign (sorry for the example, only one I can think of right now) where they use a high percentage of their campaign money on community projects in their district rather than ads that attack their opponent. Surely the donations/projects would draw positive press if done correctly, and would in turn draw more support and donations.  Would this be a feasible campaign strategy? Why or why not?  Has anyone already done something like this? If not, why do you think no one has taken this approach? If yes, how did it work?  Edit: I did forget about the Donald. Would another candidate be able to come along and duplicate it with more positive press though? With the amount of money spent on ads by PACs, etc. would that money instead be able to create the same level of positive press by giving back.
Who are the Future Leaders of the Republican Party?    The Republican Party has traditionally been associated with conservative principles and policies, with prominent figures such as Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and more recently, Donald Trump, shaping its direction. However, with the recent changes in the political landscape and the shifting priorities of the American people, the party is in need of new leadership and fresh faces.  There are several emerging figures in the Republican Party who are being closely watched by political analysts and pundits. One of the most notable is Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, who has been a vocal advocate for conservative policies such as tax reform and deregulation. Another potential leader is Governor Kristi Noem of South Dakota, who has gained popularity for her handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and her conservative policies on issues such as gun control and abortion.  Other rising stars in the Republican Party include Senators Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Josh Hawley of Missouri, who have been vocal critics of big tech and advocates for conservative social policies. Additionally, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik of New York has gained attention for her efforts to recruit more women and minorities into the party and her support for economic policies that promote job creation and entrepreneurship.  As the Republican Party looks to the future, it is important to identify the leaders who can best represent its values and priorities in a changing political landscape. The question remains: who among the rising stars of the Republican Party will emerge as the leaders of tomorrow and shape the party's direction for years to come?     What is the future of the Republican party looking like, what is the future of Conservatism?
Democrats/Republicans, what is one thing you think your opposing party should do differently? Its a seemingly simple question, one that is the root of essentially all American political discourse, but yet, its infinitely complicated. America is a two party state where leadership constantly changes hands because the split is so even, meaning that ultimately, both parties have about the same amount of supporters. In light of this, what is one thing you think the party your opposed to should do differently. If you're an Independent, just pick the one you like the least. Also a general rule: don't just say "this party should be less left or right wing".
How dangerous is polarization in US politics? No matter the topic - most of the time it will be split into either option A or option B. That means you can't have any middle ground between that and if you take one position you must also align with other things associated with that position.   The reason for this is that, obviously, there are only two major parties that are heavily opposed to another. If a republican agrees with anything that a democrat says, he will be riddiculed, and the other way around. This is the reason why so many other countries have more than just two major parties  Another reason is that people are pushed towards one end of politics through media to convince you that there are only two sides. A further reason for this is the huge flow of misinformation in the media. Lots of politicians or news service simply state wrong information to push their agenda.    This issue of polarization makes politics and political discussions very hard. People say "oh you want universal healthcare? That also means you're a blue haired communist that wants to indoctrinate our children to become trans" or "oh you don't want to pay more taxes? You must be a facist that likes to go around with assault rifles shooting children" (I'm exaggerating of course, but you get my point)   Do you think this really is a big issue? What could be done to prevent that?
Sexual Misconduct in Politics: Have Our Attitudes Really Changed? Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about the allegations of sexual misconduct against both Donald Trump and Bill Clinton. While both men have faced accusations, there are stark differences in how their situations have played out, and it's worth examining these differences to understand the broader societal context.  To begin with, let's look at the allegations against Trump. There have been numerous allegations of sexual misconduct against Trump, ranging from unwanted advances to rape. These allegations have been made by multiple women, and some date back decades. One of the most notable allegations was made by adult film star Stormy Daniels, who claimed to have had an affair with Trump while he was married. The controversy surrounding the Stormy Daniels case even led to an indictment of Trump in 2023. Another prominent case involves writer E. Jean Carroll, who has accused Trump of raping her in a department store dressing room in the 1990s. Carroll is currently pursuing legal action against Trump, which is ongoing.  On the other hand, Clinton's most well-known allegations of sexual misconduct involve the Paula Jones case and the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Jones, a former Arkansas state employee, accused Clinton of sexual harassment in 1994. Clinton denied the allegations, but the case eventually led to his impeachment in 1998 on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice related to his affair with Lewinsky, a White House intern.  One of the biggest differences between Trump and Clinton's situations is that Trump is currently facing legal action for his alleged misconduct, while Clinton never faced any criminal charges. In fact, despite the numerous allegations against him, Clinton was never actually convicted of any crimes. This is partly because the legal system was less equipped to deal with allegations of sexual misconduct at the time of Clinton's presidency, and there was less public pressure to hold powerful men accountable for their actions. However, it's also worth noting that Clinton was a skilled politician who was able to weather the storm of the scandal and maintain his political career.  Another factor that may be contributing to the different outcomes for Trump and Clinton is the changing societal attitudes towards sexual misconduct. In recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the harm caused by sexual harassment and assault, and a push for more accountability for perpetrators. This has led to a cultural shift that has made it harder for men like Trump to escape consequences for their actions.  It's also worth considering the impact that these controversies have had on the political careers of both men. While Clinton was able to maintain his status as a prominent political figure even after the scandal, Trump's reputation has taken a significant hit as a result of the allegations against him. In fact, some have argued that the controversy surrounding Trump's behavior towards women may have cost him the 2020 election.  Overall, the allegations of sexual misconduct against both Trump and Clinton highlight some important issues around power, accountability, and social change. As we continue to grapple with these issues, it's important to remain vigilant and hold those in positions of power accountable for their actions. By doing so, we can help create a safer and more equitable society for all.   As we continue to grapple with issues surrounding sexual misconduct, it's important to consider the complex and nuanced nature of these situations. In light of the recent controversies involving Donald Trump and Bill Clinton, it's important to ask ourselves some difficult questions. How do we as a society respond to allegations of sexual misconduct? Are we consistent in our approach to these issues? Do we hold all individuals accountable, regardless of their status or political affiliation?
Is the US era of dominance at its end? Referring my post from 2 years ago?  https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/q80aw4/has_the_era_of_us_dominance_officially_ended/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf  Looking at the state of the world to Include China’s relationship with Saudi Arabia and South America is the USA era of being on top close to the end and what should we expect in regards of our relationships with countries such as Saudi Arabia, China, India, Iran and etc?
What is it that made the urban and rural divide less severe pre-2010’s? And how do we get back to that? Like, how come there’s been this weird attitude where voting maps back in, say, [1960](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1960_United_States_presidential_election_in_New_York) or [1996]( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_United_States_presidential_election_in_Ohio) saw rural *and* urban counties go in similar (or at least not-so-divisive) patterns, but now all of a sudden there’s a weird and clear [“Oh, a Dem? Ew!”](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election_in_Louisiana) attitude. What happened?  I always hear that it’s the two party FPTP system (and I’m 100% sure it’s not helping), but we’ve had it for all of our history. Why is it *now* effecting us in this way?   Even when the internet was already set in the cultural mindset, [it still never seemed to have been as severe as it would after 2016](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_United_States_presidential_election_in_Ohio). Never mind all the toxic bullshit we’ve gotten since then as well.  So, what happened?   Also, is this exclusively a US thing? If so, why? I’ve heard that other countries are seeing similar issues (I know the Netherlands elected a semi-controversial “farmer’s party”, France seems to have issues between cities like Paris vs. the many villages and rural areas seeing abandonment, Canada seems to be seeing inklings of similar problems here and there, etc,.), but I’m not so sure. If it’s an international problem, why?  And in general, what can be done to reverse this trend?
Who best represents the next generation of the Democratic Party? The Democratic Party of today is known for it's catalog of older faces: The Clintons, Joe Biden, Schumer, Pelosi, Feinstein, and many other older faces have defined the party from the 1990's to the early 2020's with the notable exception of the rise of Barack Obama from 2008 to 2016. But this Democratic dynasty is likely reaching it's conclusion as it's old guard begins to retire.  There are many rising stars in the Democratic Party both at the National and State level. Vice President Kamala Harris is a younger face in the Democratic party. Shapiro Whitmer and Newsom are prominent Democratic governor faces at the national level. Raphael Warnock and Ossio Cortez are making splashes in national chambers as well.  If you had to name some of the most notable or important faces of the next 20 years of the Democratic Party today, who's careers should we watch with great interest? Is there any candidate in the Democratic party who you think will most likely be President of the United States years down the line?
What states that are heavily democrat or republican could flip in the future? Like for example, Georgia voted republican for a while and now is a swing state. Nobody thought Texas could possibly be competitive but it might be. Iowa voted democrat a lot and now is comfortably republican. What states could undergo a change like that?
What is the likelihood of an extremely divisive person like Trump getting convicted even if evidence on each case is far beyond a reasonable doubt? Summary of the investigations:  [https://www.npr.org/2023/03/23/1164985436/trump-criminal-investigations](https://www.npr.org/2023/03/23/1164985436/trump-criminal-investigations)  Looking for insight from those with knowledge of high profile criminal cases. What I'm getting at is that there are probably 30-40% of people who vehemently insist Trump has never done anything wrong. Maybe that's on the lower side now that some Republicans prefer other candidates and are willing to let him go. The jury needs to be unanimous though, right? I know jurors are screened for biases. Jurors won't get assigned to a case involving a family member, for example or if various relevant prejudices are found. Problem is that so many people are more loyal to Trump than their immediate family and probably not hard for some to hide their biases. What am I missing? Does spending hours in the courtroom and seeing the evidence, discussing among peers, allow strong preconceptions to be weakened sufficiently? Does the screening process for high profile cases work? Would it work with a defendant with this level of polarization?  Edit: Would it be better to select only non-voters for the juror pool who are also determined to have no strong political biases? Is that allowed? Arguably best for impartiality. They are least likely to have a dog in the fight.
Why is the US house speaker usually a member of the party in control of the house? In Australia, the speaker is usually a member of the opposition. We have a more or less two party system, with a bunch of smaller parties and independents making up more or less about 10-20% of MPs each parliament. The speaker is usually picked as the most moderate of the opposition party, a) to take away a vote from the opposition as the speaker only votes in the event of a fairly uncommon tie, and b) because the moderates are considered to be fairer in their actions as speaker and not let their party or personal politics dictate their actions
If Trump is convicted, how do you think it will play out? I'm in the UK and woke up this morning to the news that Donald Trump has been indicted. If he is convicted, how do you think it will play out with the American public? For example, will there be the danger of another January 6 Capitol attack? Something else?  I'm genuinely curious to find out. I think if something like that were to happen here, anyone that supported the politician would attend protests but it would soon blow over.  I know you guys are passionate about politics, but I'd really appreciate unbiased answers. What do you think will happen (as opposed to what do you think should happen)?
What is a fair level of state violence for a democratic society? As most of you know, France is currently going through intense protests regarding its pension reform, but also other controversial topics such as the water reservoirs in Sainte-Soline.  Many have been injured on both sides (police and protesters), with respective numbers obviously highly dependent on the source.   Thus, what is your personal take on the level of violence that governments should be "allowed" to use against protesters, ranging from: "Let everyone do what they want, including burn shops and cars" all the way to "Send the military to stop the protests".  Please explain why you believe your positioning on this spectrum is optimal, either socially, economically, or any other metric you consider important.
Donald Trump has become the first president in history to be indicted under criminal charges. How does this affect the 2024 presidential election? News just broke that the Manhattan grand jury has voted to indict Trump for issuing hush money payments to Stormy Daniels. How will this affect the GOP nomination and more importantly, the 2024 election? Will this help or hurt the former president?
How can US elections be ensured not to have bias due to gerrymandering? Gerrymandering is a very common issue in the states, with both parties using it in order to ensure a victory and supress minority groups. What are the possible solutions to end this? How can we ensure that maps created are unbiased? I think one of the main problems is how entrenched and polarized American politics have become, so that any commitee will itself be bias towards one party.
What do you think of the “No Labels” centrist movement and a 2024 third party run? Who do they nominate, what effect do they have on the election, etc.? No Labels is a pretty cagey political organization with a sizable $70 million war chest, shadowy and undisclosed donors, and some political heavyweights (e.g. Joe Lieberman) helping run their operations. They are currently on ballot for 2024 in Arizona, Oregon, and a couple other states and want to get on ballot in every state that’s not deep red/deep blue. They claim they’ll act as a launch pad for a centrist candidate should one arise rather than nominate one themselves. Although they state they don’t want to “spoil” the election one way or the other and would siphon Democrat and Republican votes equally, centre-left think tank Third Way thinks they’ll hand the election to Trump.
Jair Bolsonaro arrives in Brazil after 3 months in the US. Could his return disrupt President Lula's government? Brazil’s former President Jair Bolsonaro returned to the country on Thursday morning after spending the last three months in the United States.  [https://brazilreports.com/jair-bolsonaro-arrives-in-brazil-after-3-months-in-the-us/4341/](https://brazilreports.com/jair-bolsonaro-arrives-in-brazil-after-3-months-in-the-us/4341/)  His journey home began Wednesday night at the international airport in Orlando, Florida, where he was greeted by his supporters before departing on Gol Airlines flight 7601, landing in Brazil’s capital, Brasília, at 6:38 am.  The former president’s arrival was discreet. Bolsonaro left the aircraft on the terminal’s tarmac, where a convoy of vehicles was waiting for him.  At home, Bolsonaro is facing mounting legal troubles, some charges of which could even land him in jail.
What's so different about the political parties In the past but also still today there is liberal and conservative branches of both parties, for example the Rockefeller Republicans were fairly liberal compared to the reagonites who were more conservative and In the democratic party you have the progressive, or the moderate or even conservatives like Joe Manchin or Henry cuellar. how are the different parties different if they have liberal and conservative wings?
New Fox News Poll shows Donald Trump with a 30 point lead on Ron Desantis, 15 points higher than in February, what are your thoughts on the Trump vs. DeSantis battle going on in the GOP right now?  Trump 54%  Desantis 24%  Pence 6%  Cheney 3%  Haley 3%  From Fox News.   > Former President Donald Trump has expanded his lead in the Republican primary race, while President Joe Biden continues to face uncertainty among Democratic primary voters, according to the latest Fox News national survey.  >  > Republican primary voters were read a list of 15 announced and potential candidates for the 2024 nomination. The survey, released Wednesday, finds Trump has doubled his lead since February and is up by 30 points over Ron DeSantis (54%-24%). Last month, he was up by 15 (43%-28%).  > No one else hits double digits. Mike Pence comes in third with 6%, Liz Cheney and Nikki Haley receive 3% each, and Greg Abbott comes in at 2%. All others receive 1% support or less, and just 3% are unsure.  > Trump made gains among almost every key demographic except for White men with a college degree, where DeSantis is up by 12 points.   This is after Fox News has been all out on DeSantis, they want him as the nominee so this is likely a blow, now it might all change when DeSantis finally announces but I did expect him to have better numbers considering he is the GOP darling right now.
Democrats, what are Democrats doing wrong? Republicans, what are Republicans doing wrong? Too often, we critique the other side, and at times, rightfully so. But in many cases, these are seen as attacks from the other side. The criticisms fall on deaf ears before we lash out defensively.   Perhaps, what can be more productive is to point out what our own party gets wrong or can do a better job at. In this way, any criticism isn’t shot down as politically motivated attacks.   In that spirit, Democrats, what are some things that you don’t like or agree with in the Democratic Party, or do you wish that they can do better? And likewise, Republicans, what are some things you don’t support or agree with in the Republican Party or would like to see Republicans change direction on?   Instead of lobbing bombshells at the other party, what are some things you don’t like about your party and what would you like to see your party doing differently?
Will the US government potentially see major corporations begin too directly challenge governing bodies inside the states in ways not seen since the industrial revolution? During the industrial revolution, the rise of corporations was a major talking point for the American public and Washington with fears of corporations performing hostile takeovers and competition turning violent due to how much money and man power was going through these major companies. To an extent, these sorts of events did occur but only as far as the corporate interest went, and fortunately, that interest wasn't as far reaching as feared.  However, in the 21st century we've seen a new rise of corporate control. At the lower level we see companies built on labor demand like distribution centers and factories moving into small towns and becoming the largest and most lucrative options for employment at the expense of the towns autonomy. This problem remains mostly unseen in the Midwest.  At the higher level, we see Corporations lobbying for full autonomy over districts of their own as seen with Disney in it's legal battle with DeSantis. Similar examples can be found with oil and green energy companies having legal battles for farmland to expand their operations.  At the highest level, corporations have invested millions into ensuring their interests are met at the government level no matter what goes through legislation. It's likely part of the reason we seen such bizarre inclusions in bills that in many ways are completely unrelated to what is passed.   But now there seems to be a change in attitude as we move forward into the future. Seen recently in Africa, many corporations actively seek to have direct representation on the parliamentary floors of African government (A good comparison would be the corporate representation seen in the Star Wars prequels). How long before these sorts of objectives are reached for in the US were sweeping changes are made so that major companies have the ability to have direct input in the federal government and the power to legally and politically combat local government?
What is the likelihood of a default on the debt this year? What would the economic impact be in the US & worldwide? Hello everyone,  So in the US we have the debt ceiling crisis that will peak in the summer.  I keep reading that most experts and analysts expects the debt ceiling to be raised but apart of me thinks that that might not happen due to the wide gulf between the GOP House and White House want.   I have read that in the case of a default on the debt, this would cause interest rates to spike and cause massive job losses in the US which I am sure would spill over into the world.
Why isn't there a method of voter initiated legislation on a national level? I live in California.   When our senate, assembly, and governor fail to get stuff done that the majority of people want, we can collect the signatures of at least 5% of registered voters and put legislation on the ballot.  If the law passes with a simple majority or an amendment with a 2/3's majority, then it cannot be altered, repealed, or vetoed without same majority approval in another election.   Why isn't there something like this on a national level?   There seem to be so many laws that have a huge 60%+ support and yet congress fails to act, generation after generation.
What can we expect if S.686 - The RESTRICT Act - gets passed? S.66, or the RESTRICT Act, is largely aimed at restrxting or otherwise banning TikTok in the United States. However, the scope of this bill reaches far beyond that. Just to name a few;   -Using or accessing services or apps provided by "foreign adversaries" will be punishable by law, including imprisonment of up to 20 years. This includes bypassing any sort of ban on them.  -Currently, these adversaries are limited to China, Iran, North Korea, Cuba, Russia, and Venezuela under the Maduro's Regime. But the Secretary of Commerce can change this list if the deem it necessary.   -The Secretary of Commerce will be able to deter, monitor or interfere with any interactions which may pose a threat to the safety of the United States, as long as such a app has at least 1 million American users.  Knowing this, is it possible that this Act will be used to infringe on the privacy of the American people? Or is any speculation of such a thing purely fear mongering?
Does President Biden have the power to issue an executive order on guns or gun manufacturers I've thought about this for some time and read through all the material on EOs — what you can and can't do. I haven't found a real answer—I would love your thoughts on this subject.  &#x200B;  If Biden or any president cannot, what do you think is the best option to get these guns off the streets?
Facing legal trouble, Jair Bolsonaro will return to Brazil from the US on March 30, do you think he is at risk of being arrested? The former president is currently facing 16 lawsuits of various severity, and at different stages of the investigation, which could result in his suspension from holding public office and could even result in jail time.  Bolsonaro left Brazil on December 30, 2022, on the eve of the inauguration of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, foregoing the ceremonial peaceful transfer of power. He settled in Orlando, Florida where he has been attending conservative political events and courting donations for months.  Bolsonaro’s Liberal Party is touting his homecoming as a major political event, planning for a crowd to greet him at the airport in Brasilia, the country’s capital.  [https://brazilreports.com/facing-legal-trouble-jair-bolsonaro-will-return-to-brazil-from-us-on-march-30/4317/](https://brazilreports.com/facing-legal-trouble-jair-bolsonaro-will-return-to-brazil-from-us-on-march-30/4317/)
How can we bring America's murder rate down to levels like those of other developed nations? The US homicide rate is [far higher](https://external-preview.redd.it/hOprYv8H1J68CqVhwi9lVOxAsIAQixlDlF4PHa3zso8.png?auto=webp&v=enabled&s=efebddbebea2cb77db20f83e06e236d16c22382b) than that of any other first-world country, and multiples higher than the first-world average. Among other parts of this, shooting is now the leading cause of death for children here (this week alone we've had three school shootings, and it's only Tuesday). Most of us agree that the US homicide rate is a scourge, a tragedy and a national shame.  What can be done to to reduce this?
Does President Biden have the power to cancel interest on all federal student loans and have borrowers only pay back the principal, or is this something that has to be done as an act of congress? What can President Biden do when it comes to student loan forgiveness, beyond the current legal battle surrounding the $10k/$20k forgiveness?   Can he cancel interest for all student loans as the president? And have borrowers only back the principal amount of the loan? Even for borrowers that owe a lot of student loan, not having to pay back the interest on the loan would be tremendous help. If Biden were to cancel the interest on the loan, would there just be a new case that goes up to the Supreme Court challenging this?   Is cancelling the interest on federal student loans something that would need an act of congress?
What made American politics so polarizing? What made the whole American politics scene is so toxic? The 2016 and 2020 elections were full of enormous riots simply because people had different opinions to one another.   There is never individualizing it seems like. Everyone is either part of their group or against it if you don't believe in what they believe in.  p.s. This is obviously not *everyone*, but there's a fairly large proportion that are very vocal.
How will Chris Christie change the dynamic of the 2024 Republican nomination? It looks as if Christie is going to enter the race for the republican presidential nomination.  He has always been a different candidate, he doesn’t look or act the part.  He comes across as a down to earth kind of guy, a little bit of a bully but tells you how it is.    [https://www.politico.com/news/2023/03/27/christie-sees-a-lane-in-the-gop-primary-trump-destroyer-00089121](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/03/27/christie-sees-a-lane-in-the-gop-primary-trump-destroyer-00089121)  For those who don’t remember how he comes across here are some videos:  [https://youtu.be/dqRY2Wad4D8](https://youtu.be/dqRY2Wad4D8)  [https://youtu.be/PkuTm-ON904](https://youtu.be/PkuTm-ON904)  [https://youtu.be/X1C1gfxCLuw](https://youtu.be/X1C1gfxCLuw)  So if he enters you will have 3 very different profiles:  1. Trump- beating the drum for retribution/retaliation after 2020.  He is facing several indictments and has lost a lot of financial support since 2016.   2. DeSantis- painting himself as a cultural warrior through legislation.    He is almost never heard from accept in articles about new laws or fights he is waging in Florida with regards to schools or the LGBTQ community. He seems to have some financial backers.  It is rumored that he does not enjoy campaigning and public appearances.  3. Christie- hasn’t governed in almost half a decade and went out on a low note after losing the 2016 nomination and the whole thing with the port authority.  He does have the cred to run after being a governor and a former US attorney.  He is extremely overweight to say the least, but comes across as authentic and genuine in what he is saying.
Protesting in American vs other Democratic Countries Why are the people of the U.S. -generally speaking- so politically unengaged and unable to organize themselves  by protest AND when they are its under-reported?  The news of pension reform protests in France, transportation strikes in Germany, protests against Netenyahu's controversial reforms in Israel or the Arab Spring events create massive crippling protests that -to me- seem to unite the countries people for often more positive popular change and which are covered by western media.  Can the answer be simplified to the influence of our two party system and a complicit U..S. media dominated and fueled by the hands of corporation/ power structures having an outsized impact on our political system, and information channels because they deem it as a threat to their power and influence, ...or is this my own bias and their is a more nuanced answer that I'm missing?
What are some policies that Federal tribes, as well as the Federal government, can do to alleviate poverty in First Nations Reservations? http://www.nativepartnership.org/site/PageServer?pagename=pwna_living_conditions  Currently about two million native Americans live in reservations, and four to eight out of ten adults are unemployed depending on the specific recognized tribe. Health and Housing crisis's are among the highest in the country. There seems to be a shortcoming in bringing economic and administrative benefits to these tribes. What are some policies that tribal leaders can do to alleviate poverty in these locations? And how could the government provide more assistance to these reservation programs?
Why did far-right parties in Weimar Germany call themselves Socialist? A pattern I've noticed is that several far-right parties active in the Weimar Republic, included the word "Socialist" in their name, or traditionally leftist terms in their rhetoric. This includes the obvious one, the Nazi Party (National **Socialist** German **Workers'** Party), but also more obscure ones like the German Socialist Party, German Social Party, Greater German Workers' Party, and Combat League of Revolutionary National Socialists.   So, what gives? This wasn't a trend reflected on the political left, and the ramifications of the NSDAP including the word *Socialist* has led some to equate them with the left rather than the right. Why did these parties do this?
Should regulators treat regional banks more like big banks? I've seen a fair amount of coverage on major news sites that separate banks into the big "systemically important banks" and categorize all banks with fewer than $250B in assets as "small." But, I recently came across an argument that [regional banks behave more like the big banks](https://thirdthoughtsmedia.substack.com/p/small-bank-safe-bank), and that we should treat them similarly. What do you think? Are Silicon Valley, Signature, and similar banks big enough to justify treating them more cautiously? Should we be distinguishing banks based on their size, or based more on the kinds of lending and investing activities the bank engages in?
Is America ready for a multi-party system, instead of a binary political system? Third parties are not taken too seriously in America. Whether it’s the Green Party, forward party, etc, these parties are often seen as siphoning votes off from one of the two major parties. In fact, both parties often encourage a third candidate to run as third party so that they may have a better shot at winning. We saw this again and again, from the 2000 Bush Gore election and Ralph Nader siphoning 90k votes in Florida, tipping the election to Bush, to the 2016 Trump Clinton election and Jill Stein pulling votes from Clinton. These third party candidates have no actual shot of winning but play spoiler, helping one of the major parties win.    Is America ready to change its current binary choices of either Republican or Democrat as the only two viable options?   And if it is, how would do it do that? How can the monopoly of the two party system be broken if the status quo benefits the two parties in power?
Peace agreements with Islamic groups? I was looking up a list of all active conflicts around the world, and they are always centered around  ethnic/religious groups who feel they are oppressed and seeking independence/autonomy and disputes over land and resources. Often times there is overlap between ethnicity and religion in that the conflicts centered around ethnicity and or land/resources, aggrieved groups tend to identify with a certain religion. From what I have read, past conflicts have usually reach power sharing agreements, borders are drawn, lands are divided etc. However, I notice that the agreements that have been reached tend to be centered on ethnic groups (which may or may not have religious undertones, overtly or otherwise), but never strictly religious groups(yes it is no different with these groups in that there may be ethnicities tied to them, but their main drivers tend to be religion as opposed to ethnicity), except of in the case of the Taliban. The conflict with the Taliban seems to be the only one that was resolved, as opposed to, say Al Qaeda or ISIS. What is it about the Taliban, that allowed it to reach an agreement, as opposed to other Islamic groups? Can peace agreements be reached with strictly Islamic fundamentalist groups? I'd love to hear your input. Thank you for your time.
Where does the United States go from here? The U.S. has always had a contentious political system, partially because of the nature of two-party politics. But as we all know, the last decade or more have been *exceptionally* vitriolic, largely because of the rise of social media and the easy availability of false information presented as factual news.  Assuming this doesn't change for the foreseeable future—especially given that we are only seeing false information and propaganda rise in quality and quantity—is there any hope of the political gridlock in this country changing any time soon?  I think most people would agree that the country is crumbling around us—in many cases literally. Will the U.S just wither away until there is nothing really left, or can something be done to "right the ship"?  Of course, this is all widely speculative. None of can predict the future. But it feels like this country has long been approaching a breaking point. Eventually something, somewhere, has to give. Where do you see that breaking point coming, in your opinion?
Does federal aid, soon to be pouring into MS do anything to quell the hatred of the federal government? POTUS yesterday announced disaster assistance for storm ravaged Mississippi, a state the GOP won by more than 16 points in 2020. Is it possible to ever soften the opinion of working class whites in that state?
Is Ron DeSantis a Post-liberal? Over the past few years, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has been openly utilizing state power to achieve conservative ends. This use of government is far different from the Old-GOP ideology of "limited government." Even [the Tampa Bay Times has noted](https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/2023/03/17/desantis-role-government-limited-power-vision-gop/) DeSantis' efforts to bring the Republican Party through a political realignment.  My question is regarding what many news outlets have deemed the "New Right," which involves intellectuals such as Patrick Deneen, Notre Dame professor and author of *Why Liberalism Failed*. Deneen calls himself a "post-liberal," which essentially posits that the state should pivot its priorities from liberty among the populace to developing virute. To do this, Deneen believed the GOP needed to realign from limited government ideology towards activist conservatism via the state — something DeSantis is openly trying to accomplish.  Does this analysis seem fair? I know DeSantis has yet to fully embrace post-liberal fiscal policy positions, such as the PRO Act, but he seems to definitely be aligned with their social efforts.
What is a Republican and a Democrat in 2023? In the mid-19th century, the Republican party was a regional organization popular in the Midwest, Western states, and Northeast. It advocated for government intervention to help big business and grow the nation’s economy. It’s well known stance against slavery was in part held because it was seen as threatening the modernization of the economy.  The Democrats were a regional party popular in Southern US states, and certain Northern Big cities. It advocated for Slave Power and states rights on part of the interests of it’s southern support. It also advocated for the interests of urban political machines who influenced the votes of recent immigrants and working class urban dwellers   Interestingly, both parties share superficial characteristics with their 19th century iterations. Namely Northern Urban support for Democrats, and big business support for Republicans   My question is, in your view, what today is Republican and what today is a Democrat?   Edit: I’m left wing. But these answers are more partisan then I was intending. I was looking for more demographic/geographic based.   Something like Democrats are strong with a college educated whites who live in Urban centers and people of color of all races and class. They are also strong with female voters and the young. The  northeast and West coast are Democratic strongholds.   Republicans are strong with whites without a college degree who live in rural areas, suburban whites in the South and Exurbs. The south minus (Virgina and North Carolina), plains and mountain states are Republican Strong holds.  The upper midwest and the southwest are battleground areas
Is it possible to fix the issues that have been caused by political misinformation/disinformation on social media? There’s no denying that both misinformation and disinformation has caused massive societal issues in recent years. Despite the wealth of information and data available online, it seems that a lack of media literacy of the average American; the prevalence and speed of which misinformation and disinformation spreads on social media; and media bubbles caused by the practices of these social media companies has led to people becoming more misinformed and politically divided in the U.S. This has been exploited by rival countries such as Russia and China, who have engaged in online operations to spread disinformation on both sides of the politician aisle with the intent of causing political strife and weakening the foundations on our society.  This is a strategy that seems to be working for them. In the past years, we’ve seen the Capital insurrection spurred by misinformation/disinformation surrounding the 2020 election; the rise of QANON and other conspiracy theories online; a rise in far-right extremism bred by online echo chambers. Disinformation and misinformation also directly contributed to people not taking COVID-19 seriously or outright rejecting its existence, delaying a coordinated response and causing mistrust of the vaccine.   Is this a problem that can be fixed? If the average American can not distinguish what is true or not online and outright rejects any information that goes against their confirmation bias, how can this gap be bridged? Do social media companies need to be held liable for the spread of misinformation or disinformation on their platforms? Is there anyway to fix this problem, or have we gone too far in this direction to come back?
To what extent could Kamala Harris outperform Joe Biden if she were the Democrats' presidential nominee? The most likely Democrat presidential nominee is Biden followed by Harris, based on current polling. In terms of the general election, political commentators state that Biden would outperform Trump if he was the nominee however this may not necessarily be the case. Trump could hypothetically win more EV than Harris.  It is important to look back at the states which gave Trump victory in 2016 which were the rust belt states of MI, WI and PA. His victory in these states was down to his populist rhetoric which resonated with blue collar workers. This included bringing back industrial jobs loss due to globalization. It was also because he was an outsider with no prior political experience. He lost these states albeit narrowly in 2020 which could suggest that Trump still has some clout in these states. If the economy continues to be sluggish in 2024, Trump could have a chance of retaking these states.  Could Harris capture these critical states?  It seems likely against either Trump or DeSantis.
To what extent could Trump outperform DeSantis if he was the GOP presidential nominee? The most likely GOP presidential nominee is Trump followed by DeSantis, based on current polling.

If the economy continues to be sluggish in 2024, Trump could have a chance of retaking these states.  Compared this to DeSantis who has mostly focused on culture war issues in Florida. Whilst this could appeal to voters in safe Republican states it may not broadly appeal to blue collar workers in the rust belt. Their main priority is likely to be economy and jobs. Furthermore, DeSantis has been in politics for a significant amount of time having served in Congress.  On the other hand, DeSantis could be more popular in states such as VA, AZ, GA, NV and CO. There is likely to be a trade off in which states the GOP win in 2024 depending on their nominee.
Where does the current obsession with ‘grooming kids’ come from? Not the grooming as in deodorant or shaving, but the negative one: trying to coerce someone into acts of sex or nudity that they are not ready for/don’t consent to.  Lots of political news and entertainment seems to weave this concept into commentary. ‘Libraries are liberal grooming centers’, and so forth.  Where is this obsession coming from? Is it a natural thing when societies become more polarized on the political spectrum?   Or are we expected to regress as a society, surrendering previously assumed normal concepts and returning to super traditional small communities with little freedom?  All with the focus on ‘keeping kids safe’. So broad that nobody can object to wanting that, but we seem to be killing off concepts that we used to take for granted.  I am talking about the right to make personal medical decisions, the ability to read any book in a public library, the habit of having teaching staff outline the learning programs and choose textbooks in schools… all things that seemed commonplace ten years ago, and are now so controversial. Why is that? Where does it come from?
Is there interest in major social restrictions for minors? I saw that Utah just passed [significant restrictions ](https://www.npr.org/2023/03/24/1165764450/utahs-new-social-media-law-means-children-will-need-approval-from-parents) on social media for minors.  It requires parental permission for minors to use the media, along with parental access to minor accounts.  What caught my ear was a ban on its use between 1030pm and 630am.  This is a lot like what [this article](https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/24/tech/tiktok-douyin-bytedance-china-intl-hnk/index.html) says China requires.  What appetite do the various states or federal level have for this kind of law, and what 1st amendment issues does this raise?
What would have to happen politically for Sex Work to be legalized? In recent years, we’ve seen the lifting of prohibitions against cannabis possession in a growing number of states and even psilocybin mushrooms. Gay marriage which twenty years ago was illegal in all states, is now legal in all states.  My question is ….what about Sex Work? In 2018, the FOSFA-SESTA bills were passed with overwhelming bipartisan support. The bill’s stated intent was to fight sex trafficking. We can’t poll sex workers but forums that they populate seem to be overwhelmingly against this bill. They say it limits the availability of sites to host sex workers.   Some local municipalities have begun moving towards the so called “nordic model” such as [Manhattan](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/21/nyregion/manhattan-to-stop-prosecuting-prostitution.amp.html). But even this approach looks to prosecute clients still.   There has been tremendous progress for civil liberties over the last few decades. What needs to happen in the political environment in the United States so that sex work can be decriminalized and then legalized?
10% Flat Income Tax Would a single flat rate income tax be more fair but still effective enough to fund the current expenses the country has, such as social programs, military funding, etc? There would be no sales tax, no property tax, no social security tax, no Medicaid tax, no tax breaks etc.  EDIT: All social programs stay in place, Medicaid and social security still exist, it’s just funded through the 10% tax. Also, remember I said no loopholes or tax breaks for the rich. They pay 10% of whatever revenue or income they have. Ex. If your restaurant makes $10,000 you pay 10% first above all else before you can reinvest.  EDIT: Im also getting a lot of people just telling me “oh the poor will end up feeling it more” but no one explains how the poor would even feel it if they’d actually pay less.  For example, I make $34,560 before taxes, after taxes I make $29,496. That’s a difference of $5,064. With the 10% flat rate I’d lose $3,456. I get and extra $1,500+ and $29,496 is my income without state tax or property tax because I don’t have any, so I’d actually lose more if I had either of those.   Also, don’t be wise cracks about your answers. Educate, but don’t be condescending.
Will we ever see another military general, or perhaps an admiral, as a viable candidate for president in the U.S.? If I’m not mistaken, I believe the last general to run for president was Wesley Clark, the former NATO Supreme Allied Commander. This was back in 2004; while he did win the Oklahoma primary, he didn’t make it very far.  The last military general who became president was Eisenhower, and that was 70 years ago.  I know Colin Powell was very popular in the 1990s and many said he could’ve run in 1996 or 2000 if he wanted, but he never took the plunge.  The only admiral ever to be a serious candidate for the presidency was George Dewey in 1900, and he dropped out.  I was born and raised in the US, and I still live here—I keep up with politics and world affairs. I can’t think of any prominent generals in the United States today. David Petraeus was probably the last one, and his reputation suffered greatly due to mishandling of classified information while CIA Director. He is also 70 years old by this point, and his star has declined, so I don’t see him ever running.  The only generals, retired or active, I could see having enough of a profile to run in the present day are Lloyd Austin (the current Secretary of Defense), Christopher Cavolli (current NATO Supreme Allied Commander), and Mark Milley (current Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff). Compared to past US generals, though, their profiles are all relatively low, and none of them are particularly popular; also, I have not heard about any of them having presidential ambitions, or indeed ambitions to attain any elected political office at all.  What are the chances we see a general or admiral run for, and possibly win, the presidency in the future?
Do certain anti-trans laws function as unconstitutional "bill of attainder?" A thought occurred to me while listening to a generalized recap of anti-trans or anti-drag legislation in conservative US state legislatures. In particular, the bills (some of which are now laws) banning trans youth from participating in sports, are so narrow that they effectively target individuals. Overall, it's estimated that there are more bills banning K-12 trans kids from participating in sports than there are such children actually participating.   Whether or not you agree with the overall intent of these bills (I am a gay, cisgender male who does not find them amusing), does this rise to the level of a "bill of attainder?"   For general education, the concept originally was an action that "attainted" an individual and stripped them of certain rights, especially property, without a trial or due process. It was a common method in the colonial period for the British government to punish dissent or treason, and at least occasionally was used to punish British loyalists until the practice was explicitly banned in the Constitution. It was even banned for States under the 10th Amendment. The plaintext reads: "No Bill of Attainder or ex post facto law shall be passed." This provision has been used by the Supreme Court to strike down laws a few times since.  1) struck down a MO law requiring lawyers to attest that they hadn't supported the Confederacy in the civil war. Struck down because it punished existing members of the bar without a judicial trial. However a similar case requiring medical doctors to be licensed was upheld in NY and WV because it focused narrowly on an individual's qualifications to practice medicine.  2) *US v Lovett* in 1946 focused in on a law forbidding three people by name, excluding them from federal employment and proclaiming them as subversive. SCOTUS said it was unconstitutional because it A) specifically identified the people to be punished, B) imposed a punishment, and C) did so without a judicial trial. This became the modern "test" for this issue in law.  3) This was narrowed/given a loophole in a case regarding Taft-Hartley, a union-regulation law that required elected labor leaders to take an oath claiming they were not members of the Communist Party and did not advocate violent overthrow of the US government. This "escape clause" was eventually and uncomfortably narrowed in a later ruling, in a way that didn't reference the (B) part of the test above.   4) *Nixon v GSA* came about because Congress required the government to retain and publish Nixon's presidential records retroactively in the wake of the Watergate scandal. It said that being "a class of one" didn't invalidate the bill, and that Nixon being compensated for the confiscation of his property voided the punishment part of the test, and because the punishment was related to other, non-punitive goals.   There's been a lot of lower court cases since, ranging from police using secret lists to target people, the Terry Schiavo controversy, and votes to defund Planned Parenthood or reduce individual civil servants' salaries to $1, none of which seemed to cause a lot of fuss.   So, these bills! Narrow interpretations of the bills look like they'd survive scrutiny.   Even when it's just one person affected, they're being affected "neutrally" - i.e. the Nixon loophole. But it doesn't have to be personal, as evidenced by the wall-back of the Taft-Hartley ruling. Some of the laws do seem to hit this note: punishment for doctors conducting gender-affirming care could be seen as depriving them of their profession without due process.  I think a lot of this comes down to the matter of punishment - is it compensated (a Nixon loophole again) or judicially imposed? Would it be OK to punish someone for performing in drag if it was ordered by a judge? Or simply because there's a claim of non-punitive purpose to the punishment (protecting public morals/children/public decency)?   It seems like there are questions that could be pursued in court on these matters and while I don't see any conservative lawmakers being terribly worried about it, it's a question I found fascinating to explore. What would the consequences be for a ruling either way in these cases? Would a sweeping strikedown on Attainder grounds lead to invalidating a lot of other laws that similarly control or punish groups for certain kinds of behavior or identities without judicial oversight? Would a dismissal of these concerns lead to further "classes of one" laws that, e.g., punish corporations or persons for political behavior?
How much do US Presidential candidates actually control the campaign messaging and vibe? I'm somewhat familiar with the way a Presidential campaign works. The candidate will communicate their guiding philosophy with the campaign manager. The campaign manager will give marching orders to "surrogates" who go on national and local TV, and field staff who knock doors and make calls in individual states.  I'm kind of curious at how accurate it is when people say "The Hillary Clinton campaign focused all their efforts on how she was a woman, and not any substantive policy", how accurate that is as an example. Does Hillary Clinton herself tell her campaign manager "I want you to get the message out that I'm a woman" and that philosophy trickles down? Surely the campaign cannot control the full message discipline of every surrogate speaking on their behalf, correct? Like if one surrogate on Georgia state TV chooses to emphasize something different at the beginning of a local TV hit, will the campaign manager call them and chastise them and say "You actually should focus on X"?  It occurred to me that most of the "messaging" people see from a campaign now is indirect to the candidate. I'd say way more people saw headlines and screenshots from a candidate's tweets than actually watch their 2 hour campaign speech. Do the campaign managers really make sure the media emphasizes the parts of the campaign they want to? In this example, that Hillary is a woman?  Lastly, it also seems to me that most people in my age group who are "online" get their election debates and talking points through sources that are unaffiliated with the official campaigns. There are political "influencers" on Twitter. If Brian Taylor Cohen or Steven King or someone completely not in contact with the Clinton campaign tweets "How could you not vote for Clinton, it's our chance to finally elect a woman!" or something like that, people will criticize it as "Ugh, of course that campaign is just trying to get people to vote for her because she's a woman". Even though those people did not communicate with the campaign, the sentiment is that as political actors they are kind of unofficially representing it.  So I guess my overall question is, when it comes to an overall vibe of a campaign, like "Clinton only focused on how she was a woman and how bad her opponent was", how much of that actually comes from the candidate, and how much is out of their control and could be based on false perception due to how the media ecosystem works?  Note: I don't want to re-litigate this specific issue, I'm more interested in the mechanics of how directives trickle down in a Presidential election and if perception is generally accurate.
How strong is Desantis as a candidate really? Ron Desantis won his 2022 election by 19.4%. Many consider this a landslide. This comes after a very tight gubernatorial race  in 2018 where he won by 0.4%. This has fueled speculation of him as a 2024 candidate.  My question for you all is how impressive was Desantis’s 2022 governor win?  How potent is he as a 2024 candidate? Was it that Dems weren’t inspired by Crist and stayed home?   Also considering other Democrat gubernatorial candidates did well in 2022. I know there’s talk of suppression but just because you can’t hand water bottlesto people waiting to vote does not explain a nearly 20% victory imo
Should the U.S. Designate Mexican drug cartels as terrorist groups? A few weeks ago, four Americans traveled down to Mexico allegedly for cosmetic surgery. They were caught in a fire fight and kidnapped, and 2 were later found dead. In response, politicians such as Lindsey Graham have called to designate these groups as terrorists.   Would this be the right move? How would Mexico react? How effective would this be in fighting the drug war? Or tapering Cartel power?
Will Xi Jinping rule for life? Do you think Xi Jinping will remain Paramount Leader of the PRC for life like Mao did? Or will he eventually retire like the other PL’s? I personally believe that Xi’s not gonna give up power and rule China until he dies. He's reigned longer than any other PL apart from Mao and it seems like he has the support of the majority of the CCP, and has coerced any opposition into falling in line. There’s also the possibility that he steps down, but retains political influence behind the scenes, which also seems quite possible. What are your thoughts on this, will he step down or rule for life?
Changing Discourse Is there a way to change the discourse of how topics are discussed in society? Media has the most control over the conversations had by society, is there a way to change how media approaches issues or different ways to change discourse in society. For example, there is virtually no discussion about what socialism actually means, why anyone perceives it as evil, what evidence they have to support whether or not it actually is evil, who is pushing for the parts that are perceived as evil, how large of a percentage of the population support it, or how support for it is growing or shrinking.  Discussion largely circles around what people say, and not about what they are saying means.
How can the international community confront Haiti's current crisis? The Haitian crisis is still a big issue that will likely persist for a long time barring some miracle, as trying to control the gang violence is just one of the mountain of issues surrounding the country strictly speaking in a social and political sense.   Interventions have been called and suggested, but historically, interventions haven't really resulted well for Haiti. There's also the fact that countries like the US and Dominican Republic already have some historical baggage with Haiti, and either country leading any sort of intervention will likely result in more backlash.   Is Haiti sadly on the route of an unsolvable issue for the next decades?
Would you consider the USSR an empire? The USSR, prior to its dissolution in 1991, was made up of 15 republics, NOT including members of the Warsaw Pact, all of which are, correct me if I'm wrong, nations independent from Russia, although some, like Georgia and Ukraine, have faced... Not so healthy interactions with Russia, to say the least. Similarly, the German Empire held about 12 or more/less countries, slightly less than the number of republics/nations in the USSR. So, why does it seem like that the Soviet Union is considered a country rather than an empire?  I'm genuinely curious about your opinions, and I'm willing to debate or talk more about the topic, if I have time.
Do you think former president Donald Trump will be indicted and arrested this week, and if he is, what would be the political ramifications of that? Donald Trump broke the news over the weekend that he would be arrested on Tuesday. That would be today. But now talks are that the arrest may actually happen tomorrow. He has also called on his supporters to protest his arrest.   The media has been echoing this story for the past few days.   There have been countless times in the past seven years that people have forecasted Donald Trump’s arrest. And each time, it hasn’t happened.   This time it feels different.   For one, cities are setting up barricades in anticipation of the news, and any violence that may come of it.   New York City: https://www.reuters.com/world/us/new-york-city-braces-trump-indictment-after-ex-president-urges-protests-2023-03-20/  Washington DC: https://www.fox5dc.com/news/heightened-security-expected-around-us-capitol-in-dc-amid-potential-trump-indictment.amp  Secondly, the Manhattan DA has come out and responded to Trump’s statement: https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna75617  In short, this time it seems it’s beyond just words and speculation. It feels like the world is preparing for something to happen.   Do you think NYC will indict and arrest former president Donald Trump? And if they do, what do you think will be the political consequences of that?
Should fines (tickets, criminal offenses, ect) be a percentage instead of a fixed dollar amount? A 500.00 traffic ticket will hurt a lot more for lower income people than more wealthy people. If fines were imposed more on a fixed percent, and deducted similar to taxes, the fine would carry the same weight for everyone.
Annexation of east Siberia by China? China wants crude materials/minerals for its expansion in semionductor-development and Russia is weakened by its invasion, having only the GDP compared to Texas (2018 consensus).      So could it be imagined that Russia trades East Siberia for an international security and stabilization of the annexed areas Krim and Donbas? [Link for elaboration](https://thehill.com/opinion/international/3654427-does-china-have-designs-on-siberia/)    Or even China sees it change to invade the sparsely populated areas, set up new infratructure and populates the area with 75 mio people over the next years? [Link for elaboration](https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2014/07/03/where-do-borders-need-to-be-redrawn/why-china-will-reclaim-siberia)     In 1850's China was weakened by the strategic opium trade from the british, being forced to sign some treaties, hereby the Amur Annexation. 180 years later, China is stronger than ever before. Russia is weakened and with China's need for minerals to fuel their technological advancement. Would it be plausible to think that China wants these areas ( and more perhaps) back?
Since the 2016 election, why have Democrats performed well in gubernatorial races.? Since the 2016 presidential election, Democrats have performed well in the nearly every gubernatorial election cycle. This is a reversal from 2010 to 2016. Democrats have won governorships in states where there is a GOP stronghold in federal elections. Does this suggests that Republican leaning voters prefer Democratic governors?  These are some of the Democratic gains in gubernatorial elections since 2016.  2017: NJ 2018: KS, ME, MI, NV, NM, IL, WI 2019: KY 2022: AZ, MA, MD  It must be noted they have lost some governorships such as MT (2020), VA (2021), NV (2022) but they have gained more seats. Furthermore, they retained many governorships in the 2022 election cycle.
Millennials are more likely than other generations to support a cap on personal wealth. What to make of this? [Millennials are more likely than other generations to support a cap on personal wealth](https://www.fastcompany.com/90865652/wealth-cap-millennials-support-generation-z-boomers-poll)  "Thirty-three percent [of Millennials] say that a cap should exist in the United States on personal wealth, a surprisingly high number that also made this generation a bit of an outlier: No other age group indicated this much support."  What to make of this?
The moral integrity of German weapons export I am from Germany and our government (and the people supporting it and all the values it represents) are very prone to condemn the actions of other governments as immoral. Germany, in the mind of the Germans, seems to represent a very high moral standard. We're intervening when we need to stop a baddie - apart from that we're pacifist.  I'm asking myself: How much morally condemnable stuff is my country doing without anyone calling it by its name? It's interesting how non-existent the discussion about our weapons export is and I want to break out of this skewed perspective that Germany has on itself. Many Americans thought the Iraq war was justified, many Russians think that the Ukraine war was provoked by the NATO and that Russia is just defending itself. I want some degree of objectivity and your informed perspectives.  To me, this topic of weapons export is just too much of an overkill when brought up in conversations to adequately pigeonhole it. It's always used as a counterweight to relativize the evil-doings of other countries: "Yeah, but you're also doing *it*." And then my position shifts to the fatalistic: "We're all hypocrites, we're just as evil as XY", sigh.  But that gets me nowhere. There's a difference between selling machetes to the Hutus and the Tutsis to profit from the massacres and giving guns to the Kurds because it seems like the right side to be on in a given situation. War is always bad, and Germany does 100% not have a clean slate. But how bad is it?  Do you have specific examples of Germany supporting people or nations they wouldn't be proud of supporting?     Thank you!
Where is the "resistance" to Florida's current legislative slate, and how can those who are concerned make a difference? What organizations or people are doing the best work to push back against the slate of bills currently in front of the Florida legislature? Or is any meaningful work happening strictly in the courts, where lay folks who are not lawyers have little to offer?   The 6-week abortion ban is no doubt among the most unpopular, with those opposed outnumbering those in favor in both parties. HB 999, the bill having to do with giving the state more power over universities, is the most obviously unconstitutional. There are, of course, plenty more.  I realize not everyone here will agree. But this post is really about: IF you are in the same camp, what good work are you aware of that is happening to curtail these excesses and is there any need for pro bono services to support?
Can Elizabeth Warren make a comeback, and if not, who else could lead the Progressive wing after Bernie Sanders? Elizabeth Warren is perhaps the most outspoken progressive, outside of Bernie Sanders, in the senate. In her last bid for the presidency, she made a fatal flaw to undermine Bernie at a crucial point in the race, which earned her lots of backlash. It was ugly, tainted her character and made herself look like an opportunist.  What’s done is done, it’s water under the bridge now. Let bygones by bygones. Other than Bernie, she’s perhaps the most vocal progressive and she’s sharp as a tack.   The country decided it wanted a voice from the center from a well known senator, so Biden won in the end. This is the temperature of the country now but that doesn’t it won’t swing left or hard-right again.   Bernie, love him or hate him, is getting up there in age. In fact, he’s older than both Biden and Trump. He’s been in the 80 club for a year now. He still the most recognizable progressive voice in the country but at some point, he’ll need to pass the torch down to another person.   Can Bernie supporters forgive Elizabeth Warren for her actions in the past? And if not Warren, who else has a real shot of taking up the progressive wing after Bernie steps down?
What needs to happen for America to become less divided? American political divisions have increased drastically over the past two decades, despite the Democratic and Republican parties both being on the right side of the political spectrum. It seems Americans can’t even agree on whether or not guns should be allowed in schools, something that wouldn’t have even been up for debate not that long ago.  I have friends that don’t feel comfortable disclosing their political affiliations in public out of fear of potentially being accosted or threatened by strangers that disagree with them.   What needs to be done to reverse the damage and make America less divided politically?
Should companies too big to fail forcibly be made smaller? When some big banks and other companies seemed to go down they got propped up by the US government to prevent their failure.  If they had been smaller losses to the market might be limited negating the need for government intervention. Should such companies therefore be split to prevent the need for government intervention at all? Should the companies stay as they are, but left to their own devices without government aid? Or is government aid to big corporations the  most efficient way to prevent market crashes?

If Biden doesn't run, is there any possibility that he makes it known that he will stay on as vice president, in order to keep some incumbent advantage? People have wondered if Kamala Harris will get replaced the next go-around, but it seemed like the general answer was, probably not, because vice presidents just don't really matter that much. But if Biden decided not to run, I wonder if the name recognition would be worthwhile enough for him to declare that he would be VP.
How vulnerable is the Inflation Reduction Act to a Republic controlled congress and presidency? I'm curious if this is similar to an obamacare situation, where a Republican-led government could whittle some things away, but the law could still largely stand, or if they actually could just undo everything. It was hailed as such a landmark piece of legislation in terms of fighting climate change, but obviously that's meaningless if it goes away in a few years.
What are the political implications of President Macron of France using article 49.3 in the French Constitution to ram through an extremely unpopular bill that would see the retirement age increase? President Macron passed legislation using Article 49.3 which allows for the government to compel the majority if reluctant to adopt a text, and also to accelerate the legislative process, and in particular to end any obstruction from the opposition. He used it to increase the retirement age and a lot of people in France are saying this is an abuse of power and authoritarianism. What do you guys think? What are the political implications of this and will this affect French Politics and the Fifth Republic?
Is it possible to have federalism without judicial review? I know many democracies don't have judicial review, but it's hard to imagine federalism without it. Suppose the US got rid of judicial review. How would the federal government prevent states from passing very sinister laws? How would the federal government enforce laws against states? Would the FBI have to arrest governors of states that violate federal laws? How can there be semi-autonomous entities without a court interpreting a constitution that defines the parameters within which the entities can pass laws?  How exactly can a country have federalism without judicial review?
How similar or dissimilar would a Biden-DeSantis election in 2024 be compared with the Bush, Sr.-Clinton election in 1992? In 1992, the Bush, Sr. vs. Clinton election was seen as a generational shift where the baby boomers upstaged the pre-WWII generation (Bush, Sr. was born in 1924) for the first time. Clinton was heralded as emblematic of his cohort (appearing on the Arsenio Hall show playing the saxophone) while Bush. Sr. was looking at his watch in the debate.  Clinton overwhelmingly won the youth vote and although he didn't ever win the popular vote majority, he won comfortable electoral college victories in his two elections.  Would a Biden-DeSantis matchup feature similar dynamics where one candidate (DeSantis) was seen as the future and the other the past (Biden)? Would DeSantis' generation, Gen-X, be decisive to his victory, like Clinton's were for him? Are the issues DeSantis and Biden would run on favor one candidate in terms of swaying the votes of the young, the middle-aged, and the old?
What are some misconceptions about the left and right parties? Are there any over exaggerations or misconceptions about the left and right wings?  All I can think of is the misconception that the far left accepted pedos (or maps) as part of the LBGTQ community, when the main opinion was that they were cast out.
How Open Primaries with Ranked Choice Voting Could Revolutionize Our Political Landscape, what are your thoughts? Hey everyone,  I wanted to discuss the impact of the Open Primaries and Ranked Choice Voting (RCV) initiatives currently being pushed by organizations like the Andrew Yang's Forward Party and others. As we know, the political landscape has long been dominated by extremes, with political leaders often pandering to the most partisan voters. By implementing these electoral reforms, we have a real chance to reshape our political system and free our leaders from the stranglehold of extreme ideologies.  **Open Primaries**  Currently, most primaries are either closed or semi-closed, meaning only registered party members can participate in the nomination process. Open Primaries, on the other hand, allow all registered voters to participate, regardless of their political affiliation. Here's how this change would impact our political landscape:  1. *Broader representation*: Open Primaries provide a platform for independent and moderate voters to have a say in the nomination process. This, in turn, could lead to more centrist and pragmatic candidates winning party nominations. 2. *Reduced polarization*: By allowing voters from all affiliations to participate, Open Primaries could dilute the influence of the most extreme factions within each party, resulting in less polarizing candidates and policies. 3. *Increased competition*: Open Primaries would force candidates to appeal to a wider range of voters, making it more difficult for incumbents to rely on partisan loyalty alone.  **Ranked Choice Voting (RCV)**  RCV is a voting system where voters rank candidates in order of preference. If no candidate receives a majority of first-choice votes, the candidate with the least votes is eliminated, and their votes are redistributed based on the second-choice preferences of their supporters. This process continues until a candidate receives a majority of votes. Here's how RCV could transform our political landscape:  1. *Elimination of the "spoiler effect"*: In the current system, third-party or independent candidates often split the vote, unintentionally benefiting a less-favored candidate. With RCV, voters can safely express their true preferences without worrying about wasting their vote. 2. *Encouraging compromise and coalition-building*: RCV incentivizes candidates to appeal to a broader range of voters, as they might need second- or third-choice votes to secure a victory. This promotes a more collaborative, less adversarial political climate. 3. *Increased voter satisfaction*: By allowing voters to rank their preferences, RCV ensures that the winning candidate has broader support from the electorate, which can lead to higher voter satisfaction with election outcomes.  Together, Open Primaries and Ranked Choice Voting can create a political landscape where candidates and leaders are no longer beholden to extreme ideologies. By fostering a more inclusive, less polarized system, these reforms can help us build a healthier democracy where compromise and collaboration become the norm.  Do you think these two mechanisms would change our political landscape?
Does joe Biden have a chance in 2024? Joe Biden has said several times that he is running for reelection and several democrats have come out and said that they will support him if he is the democrat nomination. With inflation and now the banking crisis on top of all the other crisis' that have happened in the last couple years, does anyone think he has a chance for reelection?  &#x200B;  On top of all this, if it comes down to Donald Trump vs Joe Biden again, who do ya'll predict being the winner?  &#x200B;  Genuine discussions/debates please! 
If the Federal Judge rules in favor of the plaintiffs in the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine v. US Food and Drug Administration. What will be the short to mid-term impact due to this ruling? Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine v. U.S. Food and Drug Administration is a 2022 case in the US District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Amarillo Division, challenging the U.S Food and Drug Agency's approval of mifepristone, a drug frequently used in medical abortion procedures. The plaintiff, the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine (AHM), argues that the FDA’s approval of mifepristone for pregnancy termination was impermissible under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and asks for an injunction to immediately suspend its approval, removing it from the market.   The judge overseeing the case is Matthew J. Kacsmaryk, nominated to the Texas District Court in Amarillo in 2017 by former President Donald Trump. Kacsmaryk has been described as a "devout Christian" and reliably conservative judge, whose opinions challenge the Biden administration on issues of immigration policy, LGBTQ rights and abortion.  Kacsmaryk could issue a broad ruling, ordering the government to withdraw approval of the drug, or issue a more limited decision — for example, requiring the FDA to reimpose restrictions on how mifepristone is distributed.  Based on prior rulings, it is likely he will choose the former decision.  If so, what will be the short-term to mid-term impact of this ruling?
When did Republicans become isolationists? I am not a political history buff, but I’m having trouble remembering a time when Republicans were this much into isolationism since Trump was in office. As I recall, a large part of the republican platform for a long time was about promoting American values all over the world. I am old enough to remember when President George W. Bush sent troops into Iraq to promote freedom or whatever and changed french fries to freedom fries.  I am especially whiplashed in regard to the Republican position on Ukraine, because Ukraine was invaded by an authoritarian country, and republicans are supposed to hate authoritarianism.   What happened? I am not making an argument in favor of more arms to Ukraine or sending troops over there or whatever. I am just genuinely curious about how the republican platform on this changed so fast.
If the Supreme Court supports President Biden’s student loan debt forgiveness decision, what more can President Biden do in regards to student loans? The pandemic emergency has come to an end. Meaning that’s the end of the Heroes act.   Beyond this, is there anything else that Biden can do regarding student loans? Could he extend the interest-free holiday? Could he make the interest-free permanent? Not that he will or won’t, but could he - is that in his power as president?   Is the current student loan debt forgiveness fight basically the last hurrah for Biden when it comes to actions pertaining to student loans? A campaign promise that can be checked off?   Some 40 million people are overwhelmed with student loan debt, especially the interest part of the loan. Some have been paying for years, only to see their loan increase.   This is stopping a lot of young families from moving on with their lives, from buying a home, paying down other debts, etc.   What more can Biden do as president to tackle student loan debt or is everything from here on up to congress to do something about it?
What Changes Could Be Made That Would Help To Improve the Quality of Candidates Running for Office and/or the People Working in Government at Any/All Levels? There’s that cliche that the only people truly fit for the presidency would never be interested in seeking the position, and while repeated ad nauseam, there’s definitely some truth to it. But I think this is in some ways the case for any elected office and for government employees generally. What do you think we can do specifically - at any level - to alleviate this issue as much as possible and encourage the best, brightest, and most honest among us to seek these positions?  The first general thing I can think of, of course, is to pay them more. Devil’s advocate would be that it could erode the concept of a “representative” by making them appearing out-of-touch with those they represent.  Perhaps ways to make it easier to run for office?  Any solutions you’ve encountered that have merit or papers you’ve read on this topic?  EDIT: I want to note that I asked how we can encourage the “best, brightest, and most honest” among us to seek positions, elected or otherwise, in government – it seems thus far people have been focusing mostly on the “honest” part of that and less on the “best and brightest” part. Though preventing corrupt, morally bankrupt people from seeking office or being interested in government work is certainly an important part of this, I’m particularly interested in how we can encourage whip-smart, super capable people generally to get into government/municipal work and/or elected office, assuming they have a solid moral compass.  EDIT 2: I think people are misunderstanding my question. I’m asking how we can make government positions, elected and otherwise, more appealing for well-qualified individuals to seek out. Like, to get them to be interested in running in the *first place*.
What are the geopolitical implications of the trilateral AUKUS Security Agreement? What are the day to day operations to look like? And what ground work had gone into developing it? This seems to be a massive project given the coordination of these three countries. It seems to be like a NATO of the Anglosphere.   Is there a reason why Japan and NZ, among other nations, were not included?  It seems to be a hedge against Chinese advancement into friendly waters, given their bold stance in the South China Sea.
Are SVB depositors "owed" a bailout because the bank went bust holding US treasuries and believing inflation was 'transitory'? I imagine the answer is NO  But does believing the Fed's guidance carry consolation?  Even though most know it's intention is to manipulate expectations not provide accurate outlook.  >a US bank has just failed because it invested much of its swollen base of deposits, mostly redeemable at demand, into a long-term, held-to-maturity bond portfolio without any interest rate hedge.  https://www.ft.com/content/02576e3c-67c8-4a7c-86b3-bc9c270a90b6
At what point can a current administration no longer blame a former administration? Every administration in every elected democracy has an interest in saying that they fixed the problems from the previous administration and bad things that happen in their administration being the aftermath of the previous administration. This is an electoral strategy that has and likely always will be part of democratic politics, but at what point can an administration no longer pin blame on the previous?
What would be the dynamics of a South Africa where the ANC didn´t have their absolute majority anymore? South Africa has been governed by the African National Congress since 1995. Initially widely praised, and they still continue to get majorities of the votes in the National Assembly, they have faced pushback lately for corruption of Jacob Zuma among other scandals unearthed by the Zondo Commission, slow progress on social aims, and have lost majorities of local councils in many areas in the 2021 municipal elections.   What would President Cyril Ramaphosa do if the ANC didn´t have a majority in the next election? How tolerant would other parties be of an ANC minority or coalition government, like the EFF or the DA?
China issued a warning of “catastrophic consequences” and “reckless gamble” by Washington in reference to Indo Pacific activities. Russia today, damaged a US drone, forcing the US to sink it. Should we tone down things with China until Ukraine issue is resolved or do we risk two fronts? Two Russian SU-27 Jets dumped oil on a US Reaper UVA MQ 9 drone, over Black Sea \[international air space\], and later during further maneuvers one of the jet's recklessly clipped its propeller in the rear causing the control room to crash the drone in the Black Sea in international waters. It is being reported as a collision, in reference to Russian pilot's reckless conduct.  "It is the first time that an intercept resulted in the splashing of one of our drones," Kirby said.   Pentagon also said in a briefing that “This incident demonstrates a lack of competence in addition to being unsafe and unprofessional.”  Briefing also noted that President Biden was informed.    German Public news outlet \[DW\] reported Moscow said the American drone sharply maneuvered and crashed after an encounter with Russian jets near Crimea but insisted that Russian fighter jets didn't fire weapons or hit the drone. The Russian Defense Ministry said their fighters from air defense forces on duty were in the air to identify the "intruder" over the Black Sea.   The Chinese in the meantime \[last week\] also seemed to have crossed their nuanced diplomatic language and issued a direct threat to the U.S. \[Much like the Russians have in the past.\]  Xi is supposed to visit Putin in Russia this week and may also consult with Zelensky via video, possibly to discuss peace plans.   Since we are in the midst of confrontation at least with respect to supplying significant arms and ammunition to Ukraine, would it be better to address the conflict in Ukraine first before confronting China or are we ready for conflict on two fronts?

How much of politics is purely reactionary/opposition driven versus genuine belief? I was reading the US democratic/republican party platforms and saw the Republicans didn't create one in 2020 which they state was due to restrictions over gatherings.  I've been pondering what the underlying reasons for politics beliefs come from and in some cases I can't find an answer.  For most social issues (abortion, LGBTQ rights, etc ) I can understand why these issues fall on opposing sides because of religion and social conservativism ethos.  It's things like cash bail, police brutality, vaccines, government stimulus, federal worker benefits, opposition to unions, and the more recent sympathy towards Russia where I can't identify a clear underlying belief that explains the "why."
Do you think President Biden will step down after his first term or run again? This is something that presidents, or politicians in general, will usually hold close to their chest until the moment they’re ready to announce.   At every moment that he has been asked, Biden has reaffirmed that he is intending to run again. But almost all politicians will say this until they’re ready to change their mind. Then, the world will act surprised when they do.   Biden has a stellar record to run on, if he so chooses to run again. But it’s March 2023, and it’s still super early to announce either way if he will run or not.   Senator Chris Murphy, who’s usually a cordial and reserved senator always wanting to “work with those on the other side”, has come out swinging against republicans recently on their apathy over gun control. A senator like that doesn’t all of a sudden make waves without some reason to do so. Maybe he’s planning on running for president, maybe he’s not, we’ll see with time.   The age debate has been discussed to ad nauseam. I don’t know if that will be a deciding factor in whether Biden runs again or not. But there’s a million other reasons Biden may decide not to run again.   What do you think? Do you think President Biden will run for a second term or bow out and pass the torch to someone else in the party?
Can Ron DeSantis beat Trump with his current strategy? So far, it seems like Ron DeSantis is trying to take the high road or whatever in dealing with Trump’s constant bombardments. I think Trump is trying to get at him early, as DeSantis is his most formidable challenger. But I am wondering if other people (especially Republicans) think that DeSantis’s approach will be effective? Seems like trying to turn the other cheek didn’t work in 2016….  I am purely asking this on a political strategy level and not on an ideological level
Is Biden's refusal for bailouts a sign that democrats are moving further and further away from neoliberalism? While the scale of the 2008 crash if very different from the SVB crash, Biden seems to show no favoritism towards the investors who have lost due to these crashes. As a whole, has the democratic part moved further left in it's economic outlook, no longer supporting wallstreet nearly as much as it used to?
What nations around the world actually have governments that are respected, well liked, and have introduced widely supported policies? Really intrigued by this. As someone from the UK it seems our entire population is at odds with the conservatives…. Was wondering if there’s anyone on here that can talk about their government in an overly positive manner?
What regulating from Dodd Frank could have prevented the recent bank run? During the Trump years, the regulatory powers of Dodd Frank were weakened. Adam Schiff said earlier today he would be introducing legislation to restore the regulatory strength. What Dodd Frank measures reversed during Trump's administration could have prevented SVBs bank run?  Edit: I see a lot of people criticizing the post as if I'm blaming Trump for what happened I'm just using his administration as a reference point for when the change occurred. I'm not placing any blame on Trump directly it just happens to be under his administration yes there was Democratic support as well.
Could Congress have helped to avoid or mitigate current climate change related disasters? Atmospheric River events in California. An unprecedented giant blob of Sargassum seaweed, **almost twice the width of the United States**, heading towards Florida.  Just two of the **many** climate related catastrophes experienced in the United States recently. Most reputable science authorities say these are the results of man made climate change.  Could the United States Congress have helped to avoid or mitigate these and other climate related problems had they seriously addressed and taken action on man made climate issues **before** these events occurred? Why did many of our politicians fail to believe and act on the science of climate change? Why did it become a political issues rather than a national security issue? Is it already too late for bipartisan Congressional action to address these issues or will partisan politics continue to make meaningful impact by the United States impossible?
Reactions to "The New Industrial State" after 70 years Just finished reading an anthology by John Kenneth Galbraith on economics which included "The New Industrial State." Written in the 1950's he argued that most corporations were controlled by professionals, not stock holders and that this was actually a good thing. He also argued that only a small percentage of the economy is actually subject to the free market because most industries were dominated by a few large companies. These companies were large enough and few enough to be free of the competitive pressures that are supposed to contain the power of business.   This power, however, comes in part due to the immense technical expertise and investment required for modern manufacturing. One can't build a factory on a whim. It requires a team of experts, lots of resources that have to be sourced, and time. This last requirement means that companies require a certain level of security in order to roll out new products. They sign long term contracts with suppliers, use advertising to create demand, and lean on the government to create stability.   However, since central planning is anathema in America, there is a stealth planning system operating largely through the military industrial complex. The state makes long term contracts with suppliers for arms, which ensures a certain level of demand to give confidence for making large capital investments for the private sector. (This isn't the only way stealth planning works, just the most prominent.) It's important to remember that this was written about 15 years after the great depression. The fear of demand suddenly evaporating was very real still.   The major issue that Galbraith had with the situation was the way the planning system, as he referred to it, used its influence to impose its priorities on wider society. The environment is expected to take a back seat to the economy. Suffering among the poor is necessary, and advancements in technology should always be channeled into higher production, never greater leisure. He advocated exposing how dependent these companies are on the greater society and pushing human values over economic ones.  Galbraith had a large following in his day, but has faded from relevance. Milton Friedman and his gospel of free markets has become much more widely accepted. Indeed, some of his arguments are more understandable to me (though not to say more persuasive) in light of Galbraith's arguments. I always wondered why he felt the need to emphasize shareholder power because I never realized how seriously that power was questioned.   Over the past 40 years there has been a considerable movement in favor of capital. CEOs had their interests aligned with shareholders by increasing the use of stock as compensation. Venture capital firms have successfully used capital to take over and reform companies that prioritized stability over profits. Lobbyists had, for a time, had both Democrats and Republicans singing the virtues of the free market and dogma of minimal government interference.   Looking at the situation now, it feels like the shareholders are in power. Corporate America is still able to deliver high tech goods. At the same time, regulation is giving way to bailouts. Companies are constantly asking the government to train more workers, provide subsidies, and the military still has a huge impact on public spending.  For those still reading, to what degree do you feel that America still engages in a stealth economic planning? Has increasing shareholder power made companies less stable? Should Americans drop the pretense and engage in open planning?
What are your thoughts on the legacy of the founding fathers? As you might have noticed, there is an increasing amount of scorn towards the founding fathers, largely because some of them owned slaves and pushed for colonization. Obviously, those on the right object to this interpretation, arguing that they were products of their time. And there is a point to that. Historian's fallacy and presentism are terms for a reason. They also sometimes argue that it's just history and nothing more.  Should the founding fathers be treated as big goods or were they evil greedy slaveowning colonialists? Or are they to be treated as figures who were fair for their day but nonetheless as products of their time?
which modern States are in sore need to improve their immigration policies due to a declining birth rate? and what generally would be considered an appropriate immigration policy for the modern age? In this previous discussion linked below, some individuals made good points regarding why the birth rate in the US doesn't matter so much since since we have decent immigration rates and decent policies.   I am curious, however, to know which countries have good immigration policies on par or better than the US, and which modern democracies need to revise their immigration policies due to problems with replacing they declining birth rate. Further, I am interested in knowing what sort of immigration policies would be considered appropriate for the modern age given issues such as cultural heritage retention and social cohesion.  One obvious example is Japan, which has a precipitously declining birth rate yet have very stringent immigration policies which they have implemented in their interest to maintain their unique culture. Moreover, their failure to reconcile this dilemma will spell disaster for future generations that cannot replace a dwindling workforce.  https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/11odrzb/with_the_us_birth_rate_declining_what/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button
What would happen to Ron Desantis if he ran against Trump in the Primaries and lost? It seems like everything he's doing right now as governor is to virtue signal to the MAGA base, to win some political brownie points for a possible presidential run. But what if does run and is thoroughly humiliated by Trump? Does he seek reelection or another presidential run? Does he continue with his "anti-woke" policies to ingratiate himself with the Trump base? Or seeing as how that didn't really work, does he become a relatively "normal" governor, quietly serving out the remainder of his term? Would his presidential aspirations be over?
What issues unite the left and right wing parties in europe against the centrist/liberal parties? Most of the time, we talk about right-wing vs left-wing in a political discussion. In this discussion, centrists and liberals are either put with the opposition by the argument maker or ignored. But what would be overlaps of thought between left and right-wing? Please, when answering, try to think of issues or problems and not symptoms of a problem.
How is it possible for both sides to observe the same events but believe a completely opposite view of them? The country seems extremely divided, though I am sure I don’t need to point that out.  However, in conversations and observing social media, it is rather shocking to see how people can believe polar opposites.  Like, Trump is destroying America is met with Biden is destroying America,  both sides completely sure of its truth.  AOC is completely bankrupt and attacked of freedoms, but her platform is to help people.  The classified documents is just a study of how these alternate realities exist, someone is a criminal but somehow another is not.  It just boggles my mind that we can observe the same events and can not agree on basic facts.  What is wrong with us these days?  How do we get reality to converge again?  Does the presence of two realities spell trouble for the US?
What type of person would make the best president? It seems to be a common idea, that the person who wants the job of running the country the least, would be the best person for the job. Power is a hell of a drug. What kind of person would be the least corrupted by power? Beyond left and right, what character type/education level/income class/life experienced kind of person would be best for the job? I'm interested in answers to this from both sides of the political spectrum.
With the US birth rate declining, what geostrategic effect will this have on the US' relatively small population in the future (vs. China, India, etc?)? I think my subject says it.   We know that Russia has the potential to be such a huge global power, but their population is so sparse outside of the major cities. Whereas China (and potentially India) harnessed the energy of its massive population and transformed it into an economic giant.   The US is no longer a leader in manufacturing, but in technology, and this strength can carry it for a long time to come. But how will its relatively smaller population measure up in the future? What threats does this pose on the US?
Will the Saudi /Iranian rapprochement [mediated by China] along with the Russian increasing ties with Iran and SA force the United States to reevaluate its standing in the region? It undoubtedly complicates matter for Israel \[among others\]. Recently, UN reported that Iran reached its nuclear particles enrichment to 83.7%; shortly less than required to start making nuclear bombs.  Though it may still take many years to actually make one; if they want to.   Aside from China, Russia too has been inching continuously closer to Iran with foreign exchanges plans and Saudis have announced trade in other currencies in a move away from exclusively Petro dollar.     Do these shifts indicate a move away from U.S. influence in the Middle Eastern Region; if so, should U.S. reevaluate its standing in that part of the world?      [UN report says uranium particles enriched up to 83.7 percent found in Iran | PBS NewsHour](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/un-report-says-uranium-particles-enriched-up-to-83-7-percent-found-in-iran)   [https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/issue-brief/full-throttle-in-neutral-chinas-new-security-architecture-for-the-middle-east/](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/issue-brief/full-throttle-in-neutral-chinas-new-security-architecture-for-the-middle-east/)  [https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/10/middleeast/saudi-iran-resume-ties-intl/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/10/middleeast/saudi-iran-resume-ties-intl/index.html)  [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/the-us-is-facing-a-major-challenge-as-petrodollar-loses-force-1032063614](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/the-us-is-facing-a-major-challenge-as-petrodollar-loses-force-1032063614)
Who is in the best position to replace Mitch McConnell if he dies or leaves the Senate (or both)? Mitch McConnell has been a senator since 1985 and the Republican floor leader since the Third of January 2007. Who else quite looms as large over his group of senators?   Before his majority leader status, the title was often one that was not associated with a tremendous amount of power. Eh, maybe Harry Reid had more power than is ordinary, but it often was a first among equals role. Who else but McConnell can use the position effectively or unite the Republican conference behind them should be leave the scene?
How did the two wings of politics come to form? What are the origins of ideologies being put into two categories and why does it supposedly make sense and continue to be the way of use?  Not super into politics but curious as to how certain beliefs are bunched in together with others like if I were to be for/against abortion and the relation that would have to other ideologies
In a reelection Bid, What States is Biden most likely to "pickup" or "lose" from his 2020 Electoral College Map? Here is a list of Close States from the 2020 Election:  States where the margin of victory was under 1% (37 electoral votes; all won by Biden):  Georgia, 0.23% (11,779 votes) – 16 electoral votes  Arizona, 0.31% (10,457 votes) – 11 electoral votes  Wisconsin, 0.63% (20,682 votes) – 10 electoral votes (tipping-point state for Biden victory)  States where the margin of victory was between 1% and 5% (86 electoral votes; 42 won by Biden, 44 by Trump):  Pennsylvania, 1.16% (80,555 votes) – 20 electoral votes (tipping-point state for Trump victory)[324]  North Carolina, 1.35% (74,483 votes) – 15 electoral votes  Nevada, 2.39% (33,596 votes) – 6 electoral votes  Michigan, 2.78% (154,188 votes) – 16 electoral votes  Florida, 3.36% (371,686 votes) – 29 electoral votes   States/districts where the margin of victory was between 5% and 10% (80 electoral votes; 17 won by Biden, 63 by Trump):  Texas, 5.58% (631,221 votes) – 38 electoral votes  Nebraska's 2nd congressional district, 6.50% (22,091 votes) – 1 electoral vote  Minnesota, 7.11% (233,012 votes) – 10 electoral votes  New Hampshire, 7.35% (59,267 votes) – 4 electoral votes  Maine's 2nd congressional district, 7.44% (27,996 votes) – 1 electoral vote  Ohio, 8.03% (475,669 votes) – 18 electoral votes  Iowa, 8.20% (138,611 votes) – 6 electoral votes  Maine, 9.07% (74,335 votes) – 2 electoral votes  Honorable Mention: Alaska
2024 Might be the End for the Democrats' Moderate Wing in the Senate The 2024 Senate elections will be major test for the Democrats' moderate wing in the Senate. Prominent swing votes like Joe Manchin and Krysten Sinema are up for re-election, and lesser known ones like Jon Tester and Angus King are up as well. Prediction outlets like Inside Elections, Cook Political Report, and Sabato's Crystal Ball among others all either have West Virginia as a tossup or lean Republican, and also given how close the seat was in 2018, (49.6% D - 46.3% R), Manchin's definitely gonna have a fight if he runs in 2024. Additionally, its likely gonna be even harder for Sinema. Most major prediction outlets have Arizona as a swing state, and getting into Congress as an independent already makes the election bound to be an uphill battle.  In light of all this, do you all that the moderate wing of the Democratic party is doomed in 2024? Manchin and Sinema aren't necessarily doomed in 2024, but its winning without your party's support in a hard red state and as an independent are not easy feats. Without Manchin and Sinema, and possibly Tester as well, the Democrats would have essentially no swing votes in the Senate. How do you all think that might change the party as a whole? Do you think it would be less willing to engage in bipartisanship in the future because of this?
Ranked Choice Voting: Why or why not? Ranked Choice Voting is currently used in more than 15 cities,  Maine, and countries around the world including Australia and New Zealand. Ranked-choice voting could have big implications for increasingly close presidential elections. In 2000, George W. Bush won Florida by just 537 votes, while independent Ralph Nader received 100,000 votes in the state. If a small share of voters had chosen Al Gore as their ‘second choice,’ that could have changed the outcome of the election.  So: what do you all think? RCV? Yes or no?
What is the cultural and political impact of videos published by Tucker Carson? Is it possible that the new evidence could throw out the convection of Jacob Chansley (a.k.a the QAnon Shaman)?  A detailed analysis of all video may point to significant involvement of US covert agents.  Some video may justify questions to particular police for particular actions taken.  One of the significant playing cards for Democrats and Never-Trump Republicans has been Jan 6.  Will the selective release of video to date come back to haunt Democrats?  Can Carson frame new video in a way to avoid being framed itself as selective and dishonest?
Why have Republicans abandoned repealing the Affordable Care Act? The Affordable Care Act (ACA) repeal is no longer considered a priority for Republicans. The ACA cannot be repealed due to a Democratic Senate and President. Despite this, the GOP pursued Obamacare repeal from 2011 to 2017, even though there was no possibility that it would have happened due to Obama's veto. The GOP tried to repeal the ACA in 2017 but narrowly lost due to Manchin, McCain, Murkowski and Collins voting no. Since 2018, the GOP has been quiet on ACA repeal. It wasn't a main campaign issue in 2020 and 2022, a stark contrast from 2010 to 2018.  Do the GOP consider the issue of the ACA settled, and is a battle not worth pursuing, or are they keeping quiet and planning to revive ACA repeal when they have a trifecta?
Why hasn't there been a "unifier" president in a while? Abraham Lincoln, fdr, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Truman. I don't know a lot about politics. I'm a young adult who never really bothered with politics. But something that it seems like is that there are a good number of presidents that just about everyone liked. It was only small groups who disliked these guys. So why don't we get that anymore? Like I've only been around for thses last 3 presidents (4 technically but I was a little kid back then). And it feels lkee there's just such a huge divide. With Obama, trump, and Biden, it feels like everyone either absolutely hates them and calls them scum or thinks they're the best we've ever had. Is this a new thing or has it always been this way? And if it's a new thing, why don't we get anymore presidents that everyone just generally likes?
What do you think lies ahead for Bosnia & Herzegovina? What do you guys and girls think lies ahead for the country of B&H? Its not a well known country however it is on Europe's doorstep. Meaning that unrests and conflict (rising tensions between Republika Srpska and the Federation) are put into focus when it comes to European Security and Defense Policy. Would Europe sit back and watch it unfold without reacting or will it do something this time? Or perhaps Bosnia would finally be admitted into NATO as the media would like to present it to the wider public which I personally think won't happen anytime soon. What do you think lies ahead?  Kind regards, Tubby
Should liberals take a more pragmatic view regarding Joe Manchin? Joe Manchin is generally disliked by liberals due to his more conservative views however they must consider he represents a deeply Republican state. West Virginia is a state which voted for Trump by 39 points and Moore Capito by 43 points. Therefore, he is the only Democrat that can get elected in WV. To ensure that he can continue to get re-elected he must adopt positions which align with his home state, this may not align with his fellow Democrats.  His voting record on some issues can be considered pragmatic which sometimes is against his party’s position. A main example is when he voted in favour of Gorsuch and Kavanaugh as his constituents likely supported those nominees. Furthermore, he wasn’t the swing vote hence they would have been confirmed anyway therefore it would be pointless to waste political capital.   He has adopted positions on issues such as abortion, energy policy, gun laws and immigration which are supported in West Virginia but are opposed by more liberal Democrats.  However, it must be considered that he has a sided with the Democrats on some crucial issues. He voted against repealing Obamacare, the vote was very close. He voted against Trump’s tax cuts. He voted to convict Trump twice in the impeachment trials. He supported legislation as part of Biden’s agenda such as the Rescue plan act, Infrastructure act, CHIPS act, IRA. He has supported most of Biden’s judicial nominees including Ketanji Brown Jackson.  Some liberals may consider Manchin a Republican but he is still part of the Democratic Party despite pressure by Republicans for him to defect.   Kyrsten Sinema takes similar positions to Manchin despite representing a purple state. She has officially left the Democratic Party.  In conclusion, whilst Manchin sometimes votes against the Democrats, a Republican replacement is more likely to vote against the Democrats all of the time.
How would a moderate, center-right Republican (Sununu, Baker, Hogan, etc.) fare in a general election against Biden? This, of course, assumes that a center-right Republican can get through the primary first.  Hogan has reportedly ruled out running in 2024.  In 2008, Republicans nominated John McCain, a senator with a history of bipartisan deal making. In 2012, they nominated Mitt Romney, a popular blue-state (Mass.) Republican governor who worked with the Democratic legislature to enact Romneycare.  Both candidates were defeated in landslide margins (by modern standards), the worst defeats of the 21st century to date. Moreover, their histories of bipartisanship & moderation didn’t prevent them from being portrayed as extremists in the run-ups to their general elections.  There‘s a lot of talk about how Trump’s positions are too extreme to win over battleground states in 2020 & 2024. Would a more moderate Republican fare better against Biden?
If Biden decides not to run, who would most likely be the Democratic presidential nominee for 2024? President Biden decides he will not run for another term. What would happen then?   Would it open up the floodgates and would we have a bunch of people throwing in their hats?   Or would the field be cleared for a President Kamala Harris?   And if we do have an all-out blood bath , who would come out as the Democratic victor? Who do you think has the most likely chance to be the 2024 presidential nominee for the Democratic Party?
Is the "Stop Cop City" Movement Effective and Has the Response by Police Been Justified? In late 2021, the city of Atlanta Gerogia passed a bill that would begin construction of a new police training center which would provide greater training for modern police forces and a better depoyment of police tatics. The contrustion project, which has since been labeled "Cop City", has a budget of 90 million dollars,  classrooms, a shooting range, and a mock city for "burn building" and "urban police" training as well as 285 arces of "green space" in the surrounding area [\[1\]](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/03/06/what-is-cop-city-why-activists-protesting-atlanta/11413222002/).   Many residents of Altlanta came out against the construction of "Cop City" in a town meeting held in September 2021, over 1,100 residents turned out with around 70% speaking out against the project. Despite this, the city moved forward with the constuction, citing it as needed to solve the city's crime problem as well as low police moral [\[2\]](https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-the-south/the-new-fight-over-an-old-forest-in-atlanta). People who opposed the project brought up criticism about its size, "Cop City" is able to hold and train up to 15 times the current police force of the city, enviromental concerns about the projects effect on the surrounding forest, the location of the project, as well as general anti-police sentiment after the George Floyd Protests [\[3\]](https://filtermag.org/atlanta-stop-cop-city/).  Over the past year and half, protesters, known as "Forest Defenders", have taken a varity of actions to stop the project moving forward. In decemeber 2022, 5 protesters were charged with domestic terrorism for their actions, which inculde throwing rocks at police cars, attaking EMTs and setting up makeshift treehouses. The charge of these people with domestic terrorism marked an increase in the punishment of those protesting, with many of the protesters stating this is an overreach of those laws ment to intimidate the protesters [\[4\]](https://www.axios.com/local/atlanta/2022/12/15/atlanta-cop-city-occupation-activists-charged-with-domestic-terrorism).  On January 18th 2023, Manuel Esteban Paez Terán was shot and killed by police during a raid on his encampment. Terán was an activist and organizer as well as a eco-anarchist and was well regard among his fellow protesters at the time of his death. His shooting also sparked protests and vigils around the country as well as riot in the city of Atlanta[\[5\]](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/protesters-question-circumstances-surrounding-stop-cop-city-activists-death). Police claim they fired in self defense, citing the hospitalization of a state trooper, however protesters claim that said state trooper was shot in from friendly fire, citing communications released after [\[6\]](https://www.vice.com/en/article/wxnvgx/atlanta-police-release-body-camera-footage-of-activist-killing-at-cop-city). He is also the first environmental activist to be killed by law enforcement in American history [\[7\]](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/28/georgia-cop-city-atlanta-protests).  2 days ago, on March 6th, another protest was held at the constuction cite. During this, several pieces of constuction equipment were vadalized and damaged, and reports of molitov cocktails being thrown. No police officer was injured during the event and those arrested suffered minor injuries. Of the 35 people detained, 23 of them were charged with domestic terrorism [\[8\]](https://abcnews.go.com/US/dozens-arrested-fiery-clashes-atlantas-cop-city-training/story?id=97649479). One of those charged is a Legal Oberserver for the Southern Poverty Law Center and National Lawers Guild. He was the only one released on bail but is still being charged for domestic terrorism [\[9\]](https://www.salon.com/2023/03/07/playgrounds-for-cops-beyond-protests-clergy-environmentalist-unite-against-atlantas-cop-city/).  So what are your thoughts on this movement? Is the protest effective at stoping the contruction of "Cop City"? If not, what other actions could the people involved take in order to stop it?
Are laws requiring media outlets receiving major foreign funding to be public about their financing a good idea? There are protests in Georgia right now over such a law requiring media outlets with over 20% foreign funding to register as foreign outlets.   A similar law exists in Russia, and has been used against political non-profits and media outlets, and was even expanded to use against private individuals.   Is such a law meeting a valid public interest, or is it problematic no matter how it is implemented?
How do you think DeSantis' chances of winning a Presidential Election in 2024 would be impacted if he signs a 6-week abortion ban that the Florida legislature (which has a super-majority) looks potentially set to pass? https://www.politico.com/news/2023/03/07/florida-abortion-ban-6-week-bills-00085865  Today, Florida Republicans in the state legislatures submitted a bill that would put into place a 6-week abortion ban in Florida, which would also overturn and reverse the current 15-week abortion ban in place. Florida Republicans have a super-majority in both State Senate and State House, and look dead set to pass this into law.   DeSantis has also spoken favorably of signing such a bill into law if it comes to his desk, first saying in his State of the State address on Tuesday that “we are proud to be pro-family and we are proud to be pro-life" and telling media after when asked about signing the said 6-week abortion ban into law that he would.   Considering DeSantis looks like a top contender for the Republican nomination for the Presidency in the 2024 election, how do you think him signing this new 6-week ban into law would impact his chances of winning the Primary election? Then a hypothetical General election?  Do you foresee him being strengthened or weakened by him - hypothetically (though likely will happen) - signing said new 6-week abortion ban (which is in effect a total ban on elective abortion) into law?   We saw abortion law weigh heavily on midterm voters in 2022 in many places around the country (was the 2nd biggest issue behind the economy/inflation *but* well ahead of any issue behind like crime), though several incumbents in red states or red-leaning purple states survive any sort of fall-out.   How do you think signing this law would impact DeSantis' chances of winning a Presidential election, both a Republican Primary and a General Election in 2024?
Does Donald J Trump have a real shot at winning a second term and what do you think happens if he wins a second term? A lot of the media are writing him off right now.   “Oh he can’t possibly win again, the country has moved on.”  “If DeSantis enters the race, it’s his race to lose.”   The overall impression I’m getting from the media is because we’ve nearly avoided a second Trump win in 2020, Trump is done. He’s window of opportunity has passed. And the torch has to be given to another person now.   Whether you like or hate Trump, we all clearly remember what happened the last time everyone wrote Trump off. He won.   Of course, some things are different now. Biden isn’t the only person who’s approaching 80, so will be Trump if he leads the country again.   So what do you think is Trump’s likelihood of winning again? And what do you think he will do if he wins again? Will his focus be on international issues mainly, will it be on domestic issues? How will things resolve in the Russian-Ukrainian war if Trump wins again?
What do you believe democrats can do to reduce crime in their cities? https://www.jsr.org/index.php/path/article/download/1371/1108/7732  This study takes all of our biggest cities and breaks them down into groups based on size and mayoral party affiliation.  It then compiles the crime rate for violent crimes for each city.  The findings are that there was no statistically significant difference in crime rates prior to 2000 based on mayoral party affiliation.  Post 2000, there has been a statistically significant divergence where democratically controlled cities experience higher rates of violent crime in similarly sized cities when compared to Republican controlled cities.  Rape, also a violent crime, was found to show no statistically significant difference regardless of leadership.  The data can be found on page 4 of the study.  Why do you believe this difference exists?  What can be done to reduce crime in democratically controlled cities?
U.S. lawmakers continue to push for a nationwide ban on TikTok. What is your opinion guys? Reference: https://www.tech360.tv/us-legislation-joe-biden-power-ban-tiktok-advances-congress  US Legislation That Would Give Joe Biden Power To Ban TikTok Advances in Congress   The U.S. is one step closer to imposing a nationwide ban on Chinese-owned, short-form video app TikTok.     Legislation that would give Joe Biden the power to ban the app on all devices in the U.S. has advanced in Congress, according to Reuters. Lawmakers on the House Foreign Affairs Committee voted 24 to 16 in favour of approving the legislation, which was sponsored by the committee's chairman Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican.    Democrats, however, are reportedly opposing the bill as they would rather Congress not interfere with the pending review of TikTok by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), an interbody agency tasked with determining if the Chinese government can gain access to the personal data stored on the app.    "We’ve been negotiating this [with Democrats] for a solid month, without a whole lot of progress," McCaul told Politico after the vote. "They would prefer to defer to the CFIUS process, where we want to move forward as a Congress."   While only TikTok is mentioned, the legislation gives the White House the power to ban other apps that have connections with Beijing, whether directly or indirectly.    The legislation cites an assessment by FBI Director Christopher Wray last year claiming ByteDance, the Beijing-based internet giant that owns TikTok "is controlled by the Chinese government". Wray warns that the app could be used by the Chinese Communist Party "to manipulate content and, if they want to, to use it for influence operations".    McCaul said he expects Congress to tackle the bill "fairly soon", with a full vote coming as early as this month.   In December, the U.S. banned TikTok on all government-issued devices. The White House this week issued a notice that it's giving federal agencies 30 days to comply with the ban, with only a few exceptions for national security, law enforcement and research purposes. Canada and the European Commission also recently imposed similar bans.
Do you think government involvement causes prices, efficiency and quality to go up or down. For example do you think the government guaranteeing student loans to anyone who applies lead to better education and lower tuition. Or the opposite. Do you think student loan forgiveness will help lower the cost of tuition or raise it?
Should psychedelic drugs be legal? Before opening for discussion, I will define two terms:  1. What is a psychedelic drug? I'm not a chemist, nor am I a pharmacologist, so I'm not going to even attempt to define psychedelics from a chemical point of view. Instead, I'll use specific examples we are all likely familiar with. Psilocybin (one of the active components in magic mushrooms), LSD, DMT, and Mescaline (one of the active components of certain cacti, such as Peyote) are all examples of psychedelic drugs. Perhaps it would also be helpful to include examples of drugs which I would *not* consider psychedelic: alcohol, tobacco, heroin. Finally, I will also include two examples of drugs which are controversial (that is, whether they are considered psychedelic is often a matter of debate): MDMA (ecstasy) and cannabis. 2. What do I mean by "legal"? I mean that anyone over the age of 21 can possess, use, share, sell, buy, manufacture, or cultivate these drugs. I am not talking about restricted access via psychedelic therapy or a treatment facility. To put it bluntly, "legal LSD" would mean that I can go buy LSD from someone who manufactured it and take it in the comfort of my own home, and nobody involved in that transaction can face state prosecution as a result. There is no prescription required. I do not need to have a medical condition (like PTSD or depression) to use LSD. That's what I mean by "legal."  Discuss.
What do you think of the Jamaican Prime Minister Michael Manley's view of politics and would you agree with his views on international affairs, social development and anti colonialism? Michael Manley was the charismatic Jamaican PM in the 1970s, my home country of birth. He is the son of Norman Manley. Norman Manley was the Premier of Jamaica who played a role in its independence. Michael Manley adopted a policy of democratic socialism to elleviate the social inequalities in Jamaica as well as reduce the power of Western multinational corporations that he felt had too much control. His reforms included repealing old British colonial laws that prevented "bastards"(children of unwed mothers) from getting a secondary education, equal pay for women, the creation of a national wide adult literacy program, as well as getting multinational corporations to pay more royalties as well as distribute land to the peasants.  When it came to international affairs he adopted a combination of anticolonial nationalism, third world solidarity and non aligned politics when it came to the Cold War. He felt that because Jamaica was non aligned it should be able to independently choose who it trades and has relations with. This caused tensions with the U.S when he opened relations with Cuba under Fidel Castro who the U.S wanted to isolated. He did this for complicated reasons. Partly because he actually did have a friendship with Castro(like many third world leaders). Partly because of the politics of the Anti Apartheid movement which was huge in the Third world at the time. Because both the Caribbean and African anti colonial movements were close, Jamaica took a leading role in the movement, helping to pioneer the cultural boycott of the apartheid government. Because Cuban forces were training Nelson Mandela's ANC and fighting the apartheid government and Jamaica was 90 miles from Cuba, he decided to give Cuba basing rights to refuel their army. This decision, along with his socialist reform caused a backlash in Washington who through the CIA backed the opposition party against him. The tensions between his party(PNP) and the opposition(JLP) led to political violence in Jamaica. In the midst of this he narrowly lost the 1980 election. When he was re-elected in 1989 his relations with America though improved as the Cold War ended and he moderated his stances by moving closer to the center. These are quotes that summarise his views on development and international affairs:  *“Human rights do not begin with the right to dissent in safety. The process may end there, but it begins in the stomach of humanity.”*(May 17, 1977)  *“The enslavement of the body which endured till 1838 was nothing to the enslavement of the mind which persisted since.”*(December 14, 1974)  *“To understand today’s politics one must always begin with yesterday’s economics.”*(1982)  *"At the International level colonialism is an extension of the slave-master relationship as between classes within a society to the larger scale of the relationships between entire peoples and nations. I suggest therefore that the consequences of the relationship as between nations locked in the colonial equation is markedly similar to those that arise amongst people locked in the slave equation. Here, of course, one has used slavery only as an example. It must be remembered that the master servant, superior inferior relationship has taken many forms in history. European feudalism, czarist despotism, Latin American military dictatorships operating at the behest of an oligarchy, South African apartheid and Dixiecrat racism are all variants of a common theme"*(Politics of Change, 1974)  *"It is one of the tragedies of the Post Colonial period of all those countries we loosely describe as Third World that they have permitted themselves the luxury of ideological distraction. Quarelling constantly about political matters they have been woefully slow to appreciate their common economic dilemma and the importance that attaches to the development of a global Third World economic strategy"*(Politics of Change, 1974)  *"Because of the sheer inexperience of the world which is produced by colonialism there are many Jamaicans who imagine an exchange of goods in trade involves a rubbing off of political taint. Obviously this is nonsense. Trading with communist countries for example does not import communist ideology into Jamaica nor for that matter does trade with Spain import Spanish fascism. All countries that are involved in trade do so from the posture of their political systems and it is a betrayal of national self interest to fail to seek out in the world at large those points of advantage to one's own economy. However a distinction must be drawn at this point. One may refuse to trade with a particular country not because of exchange might imply a transmission of taint, but to exert diplomatic pressure. Hence Jamaica does not trade with South Africa, Rhodesia as a protest against against apartheid, political repression and colonialism. In each case the policy involves the rights of subject people and is therefore an appropriate target of international sanctions"* (Politics of Change, 1974)  "*We know what that system \[capitalism and colonialism\] has meant for us.... And we are not for sale. We are not for sale. And tell them anytime they are willing to deal with an honorable Jamaica built on principle, sovereignty, pride and dignity, then we will talk the investment of the money. But if we are to return to our knees, they can keep the money, we will find another way*."(1970s rally)   "*It is my contention that elitism and social justice are mutually exclusive. Equally I assert that no elitist model of society is capable of achieving true social justice. I so contend because the mere fact of elitism contradicts the notion of equality and ipso facto makes the organisation of social justice impossible. Further, I suggest, that even a well intentioned elite justifying its existence as a transitional phenomenon and declaring its ultimate intention egalitarian, will be defeated in the end by the fact of its own superior status, by the workings of its own character of the power it possesses, and by the inability to escape from the prison of its own advantage*"(The Politics of Change, 1974)   "*Much has been written about the rule of law. Obviously the non arbitrary and rational foundations of a just society are enshrined in a system of laws, the methods by which they are adapted and the procedures under which they are administered. The relevant concepts here are too massively documented to bear repetition by me. The independence of the judiciary, the legislative process and the concept of equality before the law are categories that we take for granted to the rule of law. But sometimes we take them for granted at our peril. In the case of Jamaica we may be able to assume the independence, integrity and impartiality of the judiciary... But can we really say that each man has equal access to the remedies of the law? A most superficial observation observation of the system at work refutes any such claim. Very often unconscious class prejudice seems to lead to a summary justice of the worst kind when some poor boy is hauled before the courts. Inherent in the adversary system is that wealth has a better chance of victory than poverty*"(The Politics of Change, 1974)   "*As a consequences of the fact that our colonial rule coincided with the great period of laissez-faire capitalism in metropolitan history, our laws still reflect a savage bias in favour of property as distinct from people. It is incredible to observe in the year 1972 the punishment for the theft of property could be greater than the kidnapping of a child. Equally, an examination of laws as they affect landlords and tenants or in relation to hire purchase agreements and the repossession of property all indicate this bias. Perhaps this is no more dramatically illustrated than in a bankruptcy case. In such cases, all creditors in relation to property such as goods not paid for and the like have preferred status under the law and have a right to the realizable assets of the firm of liquidation. But workers of that firm who may have given their entire lives to its service have no claim whatsoever, not even for wages owed, vacation leave unpaid, not even for contractual obligations for severance pay, arising out of formal union negotiations.*"(The Politics of Change, 1974)  "*Since every Third World country is faced with the same dilemma in its dealings with the metropolitan(great power) world it follows that Third World countries need to develop a unified response to these problems. Here it is my belief that one must begin with the principle of self reliance. Consequently the first element of a Third World strategy must be the exploration of every single possibility of trade between Third World countries. Every act of trade within the Third World reduces the dependence on metropolitan economic power. This is largely an unexplored area of of considerable potential....Second it is critical that the Third world should develop its own institutions for savings and development. In addition we must develop policies of investment that reflect Third World priorities. It is also important that Third world countries begin to exchange information about technology since, as we discussed with economic planning, their own technological discoveries are often more likely to be relevant to each other's problems than the discoveries of more advanced nations. Thus, beginning with Caribbean regionalism a Jamaican foreign policy must be Third world in its economic orientation*"(The Politics of Change, 1974)
How Will Demographic Shifts change future Presidential Elections? (states with notable population changes like CA, IA) This chart shows [state population rankings since 1900](https://plotset.com/s/states) , with notable increases in blue, and notable decreases in red.   For instance, in 1900, California was the 21st most populous state in the United States, with a population of only 1.49 million people. Now CA is the most populous state  with an estimated population of around 39.24 million.  On the other hand, Iowa was the 11th most populous state in 1900, with a population of approximately 2.23 million people. Now it's the 31st most populous state, with an estimated population of only 3.2 million people.  How do you think such demographic shifts will affect future presidential elections?
Why isn’t there a well known liberal equivalent to CPAC? CPAC is an annual conference which brings conservatives together allowing them to network and share their views . It is extensively covered by the media and gives a platform to well known conservative politicians and activists.  There isn’t an well known liberal equivalent and the closest is Netroots which is much smaller than CPAC. Furthermore, it is not extensively covered in the media compared to CPAC.   Considering that the US is equally divided between liberals and conservatives, it seems that conservatives are more effective at collaborating together and expressing themselves compared to liberals.
Why are the practical implications of secession rarely discussed? Unilateral secession is illegal, as ruled in Texas v. White; therefore, a constitutional amendment would be required. This means that congress and state legislatures will have to consent. Also, there would probably be a requirement that for a state to announce its intention to leave, 2/3 of voters must agree in a referendum. This makes secession unlikely. However, if a supermajority were to leave the US, the process would be harder than Brexit. The UK was still a sovereign nation when they were in the EU.  One issue is financial obligations. States most likely to leave will typically pay more to the federal government than it receives back. Therefore, there would be a shortfall in the federal budget. Similar to Brexit, the state would have to pay a divorce bill before they could leave the union. The cost of the divorce bill would probably have to be negotiated, but the federal government would likely have the upper hand. State taxation would probably have to increase.  Another issue is that federal agencies would leave, meaning hundreds of thousands could lose their jobs and leave the state. This would increase unemployment and would severely damage their economy. Furthermore, new agencies would have to be created, costing money and resources.  As the state becomes a new country, it must establish its citizenship, currency, banking system, external borders, military, and governance structure. They would need to source their own energy, resources and telecommunication systems. They would be required to form diplomatic with countries worldwide and join organisations such as the UN and WTO. They would have to seek new trade deals with countries they previously had when they were part of the US. The new country would have a weak hand in any diplomatic negotiations.  The new country would likely have strong trading and cooperation with the USA; however, anything they sell must comply with US standards. This would mean they would have even less say than when they were part of the US, as they have no federal representation. Also, cooperation on national security issues would be on the USA's terms. It would likely mean the new country would be a vassal state to the US. This would entirely defeat the purpose of secession, which is to gain sovereignty.  The potential problems with state secession are not exhaustive and are similar to Brexit. Whilst secession would be bad for the USA and the seceding country, it would likely be worse for the latter.  Those advocating for secession rarely discuss the practical implications.
A “Better” VP for Biden in 2020? Many say that Kamala Harris is a weak VP - with low approval ratings, a series of embarrassing media appearances, and who has been largely unable to make a policy breakthrough in the past two years. However, is this mainly due to her own actions or just the very nature of her position and policy areas she has been given?  If Biden could’ve picked anyone in 2020 (regardless of gender, race, or prior political experience), who should he have picked? Why would this choice be “better” - have a higher approval rating, be more successful at a certain policy area, bring some unique experience, unify the party, etc?   And would this new VP thus be the leading contender for 2024 if Biden decided not to run?
What is the likelihood of another January 6th coup attempt occurring in the future? In the wake of his loss in 2020, then acting president Donald Trump asserted his loss was the result of a widespread conspiracy of fraudulent voting tipping the balance of the election illegitimately in favor of Joe Biden. While no evidence ever emerged that supported this, and every single court case brought forward were outright dismissed, neither of these events stopped Trump from espousing the lie, and emboldening his supporters to believe the same.  This came to a head on January 6th, 2021,  when after all other efforts had been exhausted, trump supporters stormed the United States Capitol in a Hail Mary attempt to somehow reverse Donald trumps loss.  Since these events, the election fraud conspiracy lingers among Republican circles, and is still being used as a tactic by Republican candidates who lose to try and weaken the credibility of election results.  I am making this post to ask the following key questions:  1. What is the likelihood of another January 6th style attempt at a coup occurring in American politics?  2. To what degree is the likelihood that such an attempt could succeed?  3. If trump runs and loses to Joe Biden once more in the 2024 election, what is the likelihood Trump will try another shot at a coup?
Asian Americans, Shifting Right 'The Chinatown area of Sunset Park, Brooklyn, was long a Democratic stronghold. The party’s candidates would often receive more than 70 percent of the vote there. Last year, however, the neighborhood underwent a political transformation.'  https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/06/briefing/asian-americans-conservative-republican.html  https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/03/05/nyregion/election-asians-voting-republicans-nyc.html  What do people think? Is this a significant trend?  It will be interesting to see what Asian American voters do in blue states that have fully implemented certain programs like the ACA medicaid expansion (which I've seen in polling that racial minorities including Asian Americans support at higher rates than White Americans).  With issues like the ACA off the table will that give them room to vote for GOPers?  Or if GOPers in congress go back to 'repeal and replace' will that mean  that Asian American voters go back to the democrats?
How controversial is Joe Biden compared to other presidents? I notice that Republicans take trash about Biden while Democrats paint a rosy picture of Biden. It seems like he is a controversial figure in current American politics. For example, a lot of people blame the problems of the country like inflation, immigration, Afghanistan, and Ukraine on him. I would like to discuss how controversial the current president is compared to past presidents like Andrew Jackson, Richard Nixon, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Donald Trump.
What do you think would have happened to Ukraine if Zelenskyy either fled Ukraine or died during the initial Russian offensive last February? How would the world have responded? It seems like Putin's initial plan in last February's offensive of Ukraine was to force Zelenskyy to flee the country. That way, he could establish a more Moscow-friendly puppet government and put Ukraine back in Russia's sphere of in one swift and quick move.   However, much to the surprise of the international world, despite world leaders like Biden and Boris Johnson offering Zelenskyy an escape route out of Ukraine, he opted to stay and stand his ground.   Since then, I've been curious what would have happened both to Ukraine and internationally if he either fled Ukraine during the initial invasion or died from either an air attack or special operation.   Would the Ukrainian government have crumbled, Russian forces march into Kyiv, and Putin easily establishes his own puppet government? If he were to flee, he'd likely be regarded as Ukraine's worst president ever. Unless he sets up something like de Gaulle's Free French forces during WW2 and actively  lead a guerilla campaign in Ukraine or something...Would the sanctions from the G7 and other countries been as severe as they are now?  On the flip side, what would have happened to Ukraine if Zelenskyy died during the initial invasion? He'd almost certainly would be considered a martyr. Would there have been a guerilla insurrection? How would the world respond?  What would have been NATO's response to either situation? It makes for an interesting "what if", since it's so recent and either scenario would have radically changed the war.   I'd love to hear what others think would have happened in either or both scenarios.
Does the USA have any good systems of appointing people to public office? It seems like many public offices are incredibly politicised in the US, where the equivalent in other countries would be impartial. For example judges standing for election (or being directly appointed by politicians), or electoral boundary commissions being blatantly partisan. Are there any examples where the USA does a good job of keeping the appointment process apolitical?
How were the relations between Russia and Ukraine between 1991 and 2014? Because of the 2014 and 2022 invasion most Ukrainians have a negative opinion of Russia. However, how was the atmosphere before the war? For example in the east there were quite a lot of pro-Russian parties who were also somewhat successful at the lower level of politics like regional parliaments or mayor offices. And in the 90s Ukraine also suffered from the transition from socialism to capitalism, so I wouldn't be surprised if some people back then longed for the USSR. Also when you take a look at art and culture, there are also many similarities, whether we are talking about the general mentality or music.  So what would you say how the relationship between both countries was after the dissolution of the USSR and before the 2014 invasion?
Nelson Mandela became a famous human rights icon because of the anti apartheid struggle. However in the post apartheid period he maintained close friendships with authoritarian leaders in the Third World who violated human rights. Do you think his arguments for doing so are valid? To understand this it first has to be understood that these ties have their roots in the anti apartheid struggle for a complicated set of reasons. They are the following:  1)Mandela and his ANC comrades were forced to seek assistance from these leaders early on due to the alliance certain Western nations such as America had with Apartheid South Africa for Cold War purposes. Mandela stated for instance in 1960 after the Sharpeville massacre happened his comrades Oliver Tambo and Walter Sisulu sought assistance from the Eisenhower Administration. It was denied. When they sent for assistance to countries such as Cuba, it was instantly granted  2)The politics of decolonisation and revolution in the Post War period. After WWII you had a wave nationalist, anti colonial independence movements. Even though they had different political beliefs, both Mandela and these third world authoritarian leaders had some of their roots in these movements. The leaders of these movements had an array of beliefs from democracy, to autocracy, to capitalism to socialism. But what they were united in was their opposition to colonialism. An example of this is Mandela and Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe. Mugabe was a dictator. Mandela wasn't. But both came from the same struggle against an apartheid like regime built on white minority rule. So during the struggle they were allies.  Mandela compared these complicated alliances to the pragmatic decisions George Washington and the Allies made in the American Revolution and WWII. In the American revolution the American revolutionaries, in order to fight the British, made an alliance with the French monarchy, even though it was autocratic at the time. In WWII, in order to defeat Hitler and the Nazis, the Allies formed an alliance with Stalin and the Soviets, even though he himself was totalitarian. So this is why these alliances were formed in the anti apartheid struggle. What became controversial was when Mandela maintained these friendships during the post-apartheid period despite pressure not to do so. His reasons were the following:  1)***Loyalty:*** Mandela was intensely loyal to those who supported him and his people in the fight against apartheid. And this loyalty was not bound by political ideology. Those in capitalist systems who supported him and his people, he remained loyal. Same thing when it came to those in socialist systems. This also applied to both democratic and autocratic systems. So in America for instance he was loyal to the Democrats because democratic party leaders played a role in the 80s in changing U.S policy which played a role in his friendship with Bill Clinton. He was loyal to the Canadian conservatives for the same reason. This also extended to some autocrats as well. From his perspective, coming out of a struggle where the mindset of comraderie is drilled in for decades, he considered it a betrayal to turn on anyone who stood by you for decades, especially when he was imprisoned. To his critics though this created a contradiction between his devotion to loyalty and his commitment to human rights.  2)***Pragmatic Diplomacy:*** In the Post Apartheid and Post Cold War world(which happened at around the same time) many of these autocratic leaders would be at the centre of geopolitical tensions and controversies. Mandela believed that it was precisely these friendships that he cultivated over decades that would give him political leverage when it came to negotiating or mediating with these leaders to solve key issues. Here are examples below of what was talked about.  **Gaddafi of Libya**  * Gaddafi is a well known and infamous authoritarian leader. Yet Mandela had a close friendship with Gaddafi which was controversial. The seeds of this come from the role Arab Nationalist leaders in North Africa played in supporting the anti apartheid cause. When the ANC was banned in South Africa Gaddafi allowed them to set up a base of operation in Libya * During the post apartheid period Mandela maintained his friendship with Gaddafi despite him being widely condemned for his human rights abuses. His grandson was even named after Gaddafi. Mandela used his continued friendship with Gaddafi to push for a couple of geopolitical aims he wanted done. The first was resolving the Lockerbie case. Gaddafi was accused sponsoring international terrorism and as a result sanctions were placed on Libya. Mandela sought to use his personal friendship with Gaddafi to resolve this impasse, something he approach Bush Sr on as far back as 1991(Sr Bush was open to the idea). The second was Libya's nuclear programme in terms of convincing Gaddafi to denuclearise. Both of these issues were reasons for international sanctions on Libya. Those sanctions though helped create a humanitarian crisis. Mandela wanted to find a way to resolve the Lockerbie issue, resolve the issue of Libya's nuclear program, while getting humanitarian assistance in Libya. He believed it could only be resolved through diplomacy.  **Fidel Castro**  * I mentioned above that Cuba gave assistance to the ANC and Anti Apartheid forces from as early as 1960. In 1961 when Che Guevara published his famous book on guerilla warfare ANC fighters actually modelled their tactics off Che's military doctrines and the head of the ANC's armed wing met Che Guevara in Algeria in 1962. When Mandela gave his famous speech in 1964 denouncing apartheid before his sentence, he modelled it after Castro's 1953 speech when Batista imprisoned him. After this its well known that Castro and Cuba would launch a full scale military intervention in Africa in places such as Angola and Namibia in the struggle against apartheid South Africa. During this time the military relationship between the ANC and Cuba strengthened as Cuba established training camps for African resistance fighters. After his imprisonment when he visited America in 1990 he was asked and criticised for his friendship and praise of Fidel Castro. He two responses were *there are those who assume that their political enemies, should be our enemies.* His other response was when speaking not only of Castro but other leaders that *they support our struggle to the hilt. They don't simply support us in rhetoric. They are placing resources at our disposal, to win the struggle.* This of course caused massive controversy in American circles, particularly among Cuban Exiles. But he stubbornly insisted on maintaining his friendship with Castro and visited Cuba in 1991 to praise their contribution to the anti apartheid struggle. * During the Post Apartheid period when Mandela became President he still maintained his friendship with Castro and Castro made a major state visit to South Africa in 1998 where Mandela actually gave him one of the highest awards(the Order of Good Hope). Part of this was again loyalty. Castro was loyal to him during the struggle so he chose to remain loyal to Castro. Part of it was the complicated politics of the Post Apartheid period. During that time there was brain drain of professionals from South Africa, which included doctors. This created problems when it came to the socio-economic conditions of those who were poor and lived in the slums and townships of South Africa. Cuba was of course well known for their medical internationalism so in 1995 the came to an agreement where Cuba would send their doctors to help in the poor townships.  These are the two major ones but there are others such as Yasser Arafat, the former leader of the Palestinians. Just like Castro, Arafat during the anti apartheid period provided training camps for the ANC fighters. And just like Castro, this caused controversy when he visited America, particularly among strong supporters of Israel. He stated that he firmly identified with the Jewish community in their struggle against antisemitism. But he also said in an interesting remark *that does not mean the enemies of Israel are our enemies. We refuse to take that position. You can call it being political, or a moral question. But anyone who changes his position depending on who is he is dealing, that is not a man who can lead a nation.* What he meant was that from his perspective it would be unprincipled of him to give up his friendship and loyalty to figures like Castro or Arafat, who were loyal to him, simply because it might offend people in political circles such as America, Israel, or the West. Do you think his argument is valid or invalid?
Will DeSantis current playbook work as we get closer to the 2024 election? One of the challenges of evaluating candidates early in election cycles is their ability to control the popular narrative around them. They focus on topical, hot-button issues that raise their profile while avoiding more challenging policy questions and masking weaknesses. DeSantis has been successful in this regard, passing legislation on (and being generally vocal about) transgender matters, CRT, and education, all of which have endeared him to Republican power brokers and voters.  However, DeSantis has for the most part avoided tougher questions around Ukraine, Medicare and Social Security benefits, and macroeconomic policies, among other things. He also has been keeping an arm's length distance from any media not sympathetic to him, enabling him to largely avoid being put on the spot.  Will DeSantis' playbook work as he is exposed to a broader audience outside of Florida? Will he figure out how to frame his policy positions such so that he can win both the primaries and the general election? Can he overcome his oft-repeated weak charisma? Or will his campaign suffer a similar fate as past popular early-cycle candidates who flamed out like Scott Walker and John Edwards?
In hindsight, was the 2016 president election loss a blessing in disguise for the Democrats? This question is solely focused on the fact that the 2016 election loss may have benefited the Democrats electorally in subsequent elections after 2016.  In 2016, if Hillary Clinton become president she would likely have faced a lot of obstacles to govern and would have had poor approval ratings. She would likely have had a Republican House and Senate which meant any signature legislation she wanted to pass would have been impossible hence would have little or no legislative accomplishments. Furthermore, congressional Republicans were hostile to Hillary Clinton since Bengazhi and would have likely have spent a significant amount of time investigating Hillary Clinton. Their opposition to Clinton was nothing to do with Trump, the Bengazhi investigation started a few years before Trump announced his presidential bid.  Clinton was already an unpopular figure prior to 2016 and the congressional investigation would have damaged her approval ratings significantly. The 2018 midterms would likely be a red wave as anti-Hillary voters would turnout to vote against the Democrats. The Democratic base would likely be less motivated to vote as there would be no signature legislation passed in Clinton’s first two years. The Democrats would probably have lost congressional control for the next few election cycles.  Going into 2020, it is likely that Covid pandemic would have occurred and killed thousands in the US. Whilst Hillary would likely have handled the coronavirus better than Trump because there would be no comparison she would have been perceived as mishandling the situation. Congressional Republicans might have initiated impeachment proceedings into Clinton. This likely would have damaged her credibility and the Democratic brand. A Republican victory in that year’s presidential election would have been guaranteed victory. It may have taken many election cycles for the Democrats to recover.  Whilst a Trump victory substantially changed the country, there was likely an electoral benefit to the Democrats as they performed well in the subsequent elections after 2016.
are there any countries currently that are moving towards a reunification? the last real time this happened was with Germany after the fall of the Berlin Wall. We know that Sudan has split up, and many other countries have clamored for separation. If we look more loosely, the European Union is a form of unification although they have a long way to go in order to be a strong political entity capable of balancing the United States or china. And while countries such as Russia are attempting through revanchism to forcibly unify their former Soviet states, I am interested in knowing which countries aspire to come together.
Will there ever be ads that are positive? There are a few mayoral and city official elections taking place in our area. Most ads are mudslinging, name-calling ("liberal" seems to be the favorite pejorative now) with about one out of ten giving the positive points of a candidate. This has been going on for a long time, at least the last 4 election cycles, including national elections. Will this never end, or will the public finally get tired of the anger and hatred and look for the positive side of candidates?
What if a county isn't able to hold an election because they have no voting system? My county's board of supervisors voted to get rid of our current voting system...but they don't have a backup plan for how they are going to hold future elections.  We recently had a 12-ish hour board meeting where the Deputy Secretary of State came to talk to the board and discuss the need for accessible voting and having a suitable system in place by the time the next election comes around. Some of the ideas floated by the board are to have entirely hand-counted ballots, take money from Mike Lindell to establish some new non-electronic voting system (and more if doing so gets us sued), or remove the existing systems and replace them with a different voting system at the cost of something like a million dollars to the county (but they can't decide which one and they don't like the three options that are already approved by the state).  Let's say they don't figure it out. What then? Will any other entity interfere to prevent the possibility of thousands of voters being disenfranchised? Is anyone at the state level lawfully able to intervene? Or would we need to wait until an election is supposed to happen and doesn't such that people could presumably file lawsuits? I have never heard of this happening and I have no idea what to expect.
Should Kamala Harris be dropped from the ticket? In 2020, there was a lot of buzz on the selection of Kamala Harris as Joe Biden’s VP. Being the first Black and Asian women in the position as Vice President was a historic moment.   Going on 3 years later, and the situation appears very differently. Not a day goes by where she doesn’t face criticism from folks both right and left about statements or actions she’s made. She has low approval ratings. This coupled with internal discussions among Democrat top brass who view her as a liability ([including Biden himself](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/west-wing-playbook/2022/12/20/the-juicy-new-biden-book-00074849) )should Biden drop her?   What would be the ramifications of this? Is there recent historical precedent? And who would Biden replace her with?
Would scrapping primary elections for US house races reduce polarisation? It seems that in most US House races, the primary election effectively determines the winner in the general election. In primary elections, more extreme candidates who appeal to the party's grassroots are favoured compared to moderate candidates. The more extreme candidate may be opposed by their party's hill committee (DCCC or NRCC), but there is not much the DCCC or NRCC can do.  This likely increases polarisation as more extreme candidates are elected to congress; this occurs on both sides of the aisle. It also makes party discipline much more difficult. Their mandate to become the party's nominee comes from primary voters, not the party leadership. This means they have free reign to vote on any issue based on their own views, not their party's leadership views which are typically more moderate.   If US House primary elections were scrapped, then the NRCC or DCCC would automatically select the candidates for the general election. These candidates would probably be more moderate. When elected, they would most likely be required to vote with the party leadership unless the leadership gave their rank-and-file members a free vote.  This could improve the party discipline, and members would face expulsion from their caucus if they constantly rebelled. This would mean they couldn't stand as their party's candidate in the following election cycle but only as an independent.   This may sound extreme, but it is common in European politics, where party discipline in their legislature is much more common as their mandate to become their party's nominee is from the national party, not primary voters. European politics is, therefore, less polarised as candidates are typically less extreme.
Did the election of Trump in 2016 cause an increase in turnout in midterm and presidential elections? And will this trend continue? Since the election of Trump in 2016, voter turnout has increased massively in both midterm and presidential elections.   In 2020, there was a record turnout of 62.8% of all eligible voters voting. This was a 7.1pp increase in 2016. It must be noted that mail-in voting was expanded due to COVID, which boosted turnout, but the fact that people were motivated to register to vote implies that more people wanted to make their views heard. This occurred on both sides of the political spectrum, with Biden and Trump having the highest and second-highest voter total of any candidate in US presidential history. Trump had 12 million more votes than in 2016. This implies that people have become more politically active and engaged since 2016.  In the subsequent midterms, 2018 and 2022, turnout has been much higher since 2016. Midterms usually had low turnouts, with the 2014 midterms being one of the lowest in US history (36.4%). In 2018, turnout increased to one of the highest in US history (49.4%), coinciding with the blue wave. This implied that significant voters wanted to make their views known on the performance of Trump. In 2022, turnout slightly decreased but was still considered high compared to midterm elections before 2018. The presence of Trump was still felt even though he wasn't the sitting president, as the Democrats did better than expected. It must be noted that abortion was another major issue in 2022.  It seems that the presence of Trump boosted turnout on both sides of the political spectrum and would likely continue if Trump remains at the forefront of US politics. However, if Trump decides against running, turnout could decrease back to pre-Trump days. This is because a sizeable number supported or were against Trump due to his personality, not necessarily his policies.
How does a person’s health and well-being affect their political affiliation and vote? I came across this study and I think it exposes some interesting patterns.  **Viewing the US presidential electoral map through the lens of public health**  “*Health, disease, and mortality vary greatly at the county level, and there are strong geographical trends of disease in the United States. Healthcare is and has been a top priority for voters in the U.S., and an important political issue. Consequently, it is important to determine what relationship voting patterns have with health, disease, and mortality*  *Just as the economy varies greatly by county, so too do health, disease, and mortality. The relationship between voting and health is broad, and previous studies have touched on the effects of health on voter participation, the relationship between life expectancy and voting patterns, and the relationship between health behaviors and voting patterns.*   *One study examining the association between health behavior and the Republican vote share in the 2008 and 2012 Presidential elections found that the Republican vote share was associated with higher odds of flu vaccination and cigarette smoking, but lower odds of avoiding fat/calories, fast/processed foods, and eating fruits and vegetables*   *In the 2012 election, it was found that higher county-level obesity prevalence rates were associated with higher support for the Republican Party Presidential candidate*  *In this retrospective cohort study, we found statistically significant relationships between a number of health measures and the political voting patterns of counties in 2016 and over the last three decades. By calculating the median difference between counties that voted Democratic or Republican in the 2016 election, we found that residents of counties that voted Republican in the last presidential election had increased median incidence cardiovascular disease (11% median difference), diabetes (21%), obesity (13%), self-harm (22%), decreased median life expectancy (2%), and physical activity (19%) compared to residents of counties that voted Democrat. Collectively, these data indicates that counties that voted Republican in the 2016 election had very different health outcomes than those that voted Democratic, and generally had a greater proportion of their residents in poor health*.  *The limitations of this study are as follows. First, we cannot attribute voting behavior to individual Democratic and Republican voters. Voter turnout in the United States is low (55.7% in the 2016 election) compared to other developed countries and varies between demographics. Therefore, the available data do not allow us the infer whether the results in a given county reflect the true preferences of its residents. Similarly, the majority of lower socioeconomic individuals do not vote, which skews the data towards those who can, who may also be healthier on average. As such, these data do not indicate the healthcare differences between individual voters and should not be understood as a reflection of individual party member preferences. Similarly, these data does not adequately account for independent and third-party voters.*”  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8294501/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8294501/)  Take type II diabetes for example, how does it influence a person’s personal and political outlook given all the challenges they face every day, from dietary restrictions to sexual dysfunction?
Will the Democrats underperformance in the 2020 US Senate elections cost them the majority in 2024? This hasn’t been discussed but the Democrats underwhelming performance in the 2020 Senate election cycle may cause them to lose the majority in 2024. This theory is not straightforward but their could be some merit.  The 2024 Senate cycle is unfavourable for the Democrats and with their slim 51-49 majority, they cannot afford to lose any seats (regardless of who wins the presidency) and remain in the majority. 23 Democratic held seats are up for election compared to 11 Republican held seats. 7 Democratic held seats are in presidential election swing states and 3 are in states won in 2020 (MT, OH and WV). Furthermore, it is difficult to see Democrats gaining any Republican held seats. Therefore, Democrats are all but certain to lose the Senate in 2024, with the likelihood hood the GOP gaining 3 seats. Hence, the  Senate will be 52R - 48D after 2024. This scenario may not have occurred if they performed better in 2020.  In 2020 the Democrats gained only 3 seats which gave them 50 seats and the majority due to the VP tiebreaker. In an election cycle when Biden won, the Democrats should have gained at least 7 seat (4 more seats). This includes states such as Iowa, Maine, Montana and North Carolina. One of the worst loses was Maine as Biden won that state. Had the Democrats won those 4 additional seats they would have had 54 seats from 2021-23. Therefore, they could have passed more signature legislation.  Let’s assume the 2022 Senate elections occurred as expected with the Democrats gaining 1 seat (PA). They would have 55 seats going into 2024. This would have given them a 4 seat cushion which would have given them a good chance of holding the Senate.   The fact of the matter is that Senate control is dependent on previous election cycles as only a third of the seats are up for election each cycle.
Would requiring the President to testify to a special congressional committee twice a year improve the relationship between the President and members of congress? The State of the Union, which occurred in February, was remembered for a lack of decorum as the President and some Members of Congress traded insults with each other. It has seemingly occurring in many SOTUs since Trump became president. Furthermore, the SOTU has become more of a party political broadcast as the president and the response from the opposing party can make speeches without answering questions. This has fuelled partisanship and created a disconnect between congress and the president. This could be improved by requiring the President to testify twice a year before a special congressional committee. Whilst people may invoke the separation of powers, cabinet officials in the executive branch routinely testify to congress.      This special congressional committee would likely only include the chairs and ranking members of the highest-ranking committees in the House and Senate. It could last around 2 hours and occur twice a year. Each member would have limited time to ask questions.   This would improve the functioning of the legislative and executive branches. It would benefit the as congress would have a greater understanding of the president's agenda and could enact legislation where there is a common cause. It would ensure that the president is well-versed in their role and have a general understanding of how government works as they would have to answer hard-hitting questions on the spot. The people elect the president via the electoral college, but there should be greater oversight as he/she is the commander in chief. This oversight should be done by other branches of government, not the media.  On the flip side, this proposal could increase partisanship as the president and members of congress could use these hearings to grandstand. Also, members of congress could ask 'gotcha' questions, and the president could deflect the question and make his/her own statement instead. This could render it pointless.  This idea may not solve the discontent and polarisation between the president and congress, but solutions are required to improve harmony between both branches of government.
Biden's new asylum proposal will require applicants to apply from outside the country, keeping Trump's policy of turning away refugees at the border. How will this affect immigration politics and do you think Biden's proposal is fair? This is from a recent report in the Los Angeles Times:  >Former President Trump and his administration spent years arguing that people who cross the border without permission should not be able to easily apply for asylum in the United States. That decades-old practice no longer works, Trump and his team insisted.  >International and U.S. law has long allowed people who cross borders to seek protection from persecution. But if implemented, Biden’s proposal would make it very difficult for migrants who travel through another country on their way to the U.S. and then cross the border without permission to win asylum here. The policy would roll back America’s longstanding commitments to people seeking asylum, placing strict limits on where and how those who flee persecution can apply for protection.
How will the GOP respond if Trump is indicted? Trump has so many legal situations hovering around him, there is a high probability that he will be indicted before the election in 2024, maybe even before the primaries.  Here are a few:  -Fulton County election interference probe -Manhattan DA's investigation into the hush-money settlement to Stormy Daniels -Justice Department's investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election -Justice Department's investigation into the handling of classified documents  There is also a long list of civil suits not mentioned above.  Not that it means much but Chris Christie, a Republican and lawyer, thinks that an indictment is a forgone conclusion.   https://www.mediaite.com/radio/chris-christie-predicts-trump-will-be-indicted-and-his-presidential-campaign-will-make-legal-peril-even-worse/  How will this change the primary and the general election?  Will the GOP drop Trump if he is on trail for multiple charges?
Does the Supreme Court have a legitimacy issue? If so why? There's long been debate over the purpose of the Supreme Court and its structure. The arguments have ranged over its role as final arbiter of disputes over US law, the political aspect of the appointment process, justices serving for life, and the court's ideological makeup potentially being out of synch with the majority of the country.  Chief Justice Roberts addressed legitimacy perceptions of the Supreme Court [back in September](https://apnews.com/article/abortion-us-supreme-court-colorado-springs-john-roberts-government-and-politics-cdff7d291a37c3b8459e787421c633d2), in the wake of the overturning of Roe v. Wade, pushing back on allegations that the court is politicized or that it shouldn't be as independent as it is.   Critics of the recent makeup and decisions of the Supreme Court have on the other hand alleged that the court has become politicized and that it's lineup is out of synch with the country due to events in the appointment process, and have called for reform.  So, does the court have a legitimacy issue?   If so, what do you think the causes are?   And what should be done?
How does the Aristotelian perspective on democracy affect your attitude towards it? In Aristotle’s “Politics,” the philosopher describes the three types of regimes, including the rule of the one, the rule of the few, and the rule of the many. Each of these are described as having a correct form, which seeks after the common good, along with a tyrannical form, which seeks primarily after the will of the ruler.   Aristotle lists monarchy, or “kingship”as the form of the rule of the one which seeks after the common good, while tyranny is its corruption. An aristocracy is the correct adaptation of the “rule of the few,” with oligarchy as its errant form.  Interestingly enough, democracy is listed as the corrupt or errant form of the rule of the many, because it seeks after the will of the ruler (the people), at the expense of the ruled; those who would fit into the camp of the ruled but not the ruler are the minority. In other words, democracy is tyrannical because it oppressed the minority. The correct form of the rule of the many is listed as polity, which is the body present in each aforementioned type of regime.  Aristotle, “Politics,” 3.6-3.8  With that being said, what are your thoughts? Can democracy be tyrannical? Is Aristotle missing something?
Why has the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) not be widely discussed in the USA? The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which has a misleading name as it doesn’t necessarily reduce inflation, is a landmark piece of legislation which has not been widely discussed or covered in the USA. One of the most important provision is the $391 billion to combat climate change which has been rarely discussed at all.  It will significantly help reduce greenhouse gas levels in 2030 towards 2005 levels. This helps us reach the goals set by the Paris Agreement. This is a potential environmental benefit but there are also potential economic benefits.  It gives companies tax credits to locate in the USA to invest in green energy technologies. This could create green jobs.  It requires electric car manufacturers to source a majority of components within the US to receive full tax credits.  It also incentives consumers to buy electric cars and install home heat pumps by giving them tax credits.  The response from countries and companies has been significant. For example the EU are concern that companies will invest in the USA, an example is BMW whoever announced a $1.7 billion investment in Georgia. The EU wants to take legal action which suggest it is concerned about the Inflation Reduction Act.  The IRA is a potential game changer not just for the US but the rest of the world.
How long should a person be able to serve as U.S. President? Term limits on members of congress are a regular topic of discussion. However the term of a president does not often have as much examination. Currently the president serves a maximum of 2 terms each 4 years in length. Many opinions abound including everything from removing term limits, only having one term, or shortening the current ones.
Where do Democrats go from here in Florida? They have struggled statewide for years now, with their only real wins being a few Ballot initiatives and the 2018 Ag Commisioner race. Currently, theyve just elected Nikki Fried as their new leader, but that is being overshadowed by a new bill seeking to outright decertify the party.   So, my question is, what do you think Florida Dems could do to regain their competative status? And, what candidates do you think could do that?
What does Ohio’s political future look like? Obviously Ohio had served as the perennial swing state for decades. In recent years however, it’s seen as solidly red state joining the ranks of other formerly competitive states like Missouri. Trump’s 2016 anti-trade, anti-immigration messaging is often seen as the catalyst for this development. I wonder when Trump fades from the scene will Ohio become in play once again? Or did Trump merely accelerate Ohio’s turn to the right?   I feel like 2022 gave us some hints as while the gop preformed strongly, Democrats still won two congressional seats and saw some suburban realignment towards the them.
how does China want to change the world order to fit its needs? One understandable critique China has raised a long time ago was that they have emerged into a world order whose rules they did not create and in which they didn't agree to. But what changes specifically are they advocating for? I'm talking about deeper big picture changes.
Who would you say has been the most impactful and absolutely worst president/ monarch throughout all of time? The question of who the most impactful and worst president or monarch of all time is a highly subjective one that can generate different opinions and perspectives depending on historical, cultural, and personal factors.  In terms of context, a president is a leader of a government with limited powers, typically in a democratic country, while a monarch is a ruler of a kingdom or empire, with varying degrees of power, depending on the specific country and historical period.  When considering historical figures that can be considered impactful or the worst, it is important to evaluate the specific time period, cultural norms, and societal expectations of their era. Therefore, any answer to this question should be approached with a critical mindset and based on well-researched facts and objective analyses rather than personal biases or political beliefs.
Should Iran be allowed to have nukes? North korea has nukes.  The USA is the only country to drop the nuclear bomb twice....on a civilian population.  Russia has 1k nukes.  Israel is rumored to have a secret nuclear program thats not even on the books.  Should the "west" go to war with iran if they pursue nuclear weapons?
Why do people want to limit the government? History shown that the United States government become stronger government over time. The articles of the confederation was changed after the whisky rebellion to become stronger. War of 1812 the federalist, and the Jeffersons party both agreed that the government need to be stronger after the war. That completely evaporated the federalist because everyone agreed on having an stronger federal government. During the age of monopolies, the government had to be become stronger to control them because they were stronger than the government. After the great world wars, the government got even more stronger, because it has a control, the banks plus other institutions, because they needed regulations, checks and balances. After 2001 the government got even more stronger stop any terrorist threats/activity. These are a handful examples but there are more if you go down the rabbit hole. I’ve been trying to find any discussions or any articles talking about it and I can’t find any. Just on why we should limit government. What are everyone’s thoughts and ideas on the subject? Edit *This post is playing an devil’s advocate.*
Several questions coming from the Supreme Court hearing yesterday on Student loan cancelation. The main focus in both cases was the standing of the challengers, meaning their legal right to sue, and the scope of the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students (HEROES) Act.   The questioning from the justices highlighted the split between the liberal and conservative sides of the court, casting doubt that the plan.   Link to the hearing: [https://www.c-span.org/video/?525448-1/supreme-court-hears-challenge-biden-administration-student-loan-debt-relief-program&live](https://www.c-span.org/video/?525448-1/supreme-court-hears-challenge-biden-administration-student-loan-debt-relief-program&live)  &#x200B;  Does this program prevail due to the fact that the states don’t have standing to sue?    If the program is deemed unconstitutional will it be based on fairness, overreach, or the definitions of waive/better off?  Why was the timing of the program not brought up in the hearing?  This program was announced 2 months before the mid terms, with approval emails received right for the election.  &#x200B;  From Biden’s perspective does it matter if the program is struck down?   It seems like in either way Biden wins.  If it is upheld he will be called a hero by those 40M people who just got a lot of free money.  If it is struck down the GOP/SC will be villainized for canceling the program.   What is next? In either case there is still a huge issue with the cost of Higher Education.  The student loan cancelation program doesn’t even provide any sort of solution for the problem going forward.    Is there a chance for a class action lawsuit holding banks/Universities accountable for this burden?    Is there a chance for student loans to be included in bankruptcy?    Will the federal government limit the amount of money a student can take out so students are saddled with the current level of debt?
If it's to China's advantage for Russia to become a much weaker state, why would they help Russia in the Ukraine War? It seems like people are simultaneously saying China wants a much weaker Russia and that China is on the verge of lending aid to Russia. Why would they help Russia if they'd rather have Russia be a weaker state?
Who would you say has been the most impactful and greatest president since the turn of the century? That leaves four options: Bush, Obama, Trump or Biden.   Who would you say has been the greatest president, and why? Who had to deal with the greatest or most difficult challenges and met the moment in history? Who would you say had the most impact during their presidency?   On the opposite end of the spectrum, who would you say was the worst president since the turn of the century and why? Who had the least impact? Who didn’t meet their moment in history and acted in a way that made a crisis much worse than it had to be?
What policy decisions have been made, by U.S. Republicans or Democrats, to either help or hurt the general population? I'm curious to see what people are aware of and what info they have in regards to what each party has done to make life easier or more difficult for the general public.  Let's try to keep it civil and to the factual point. Try to leave insults out of this discussion. If you need to rant about something in particular, make another post.
How much should ethical national-level politicians affiliated with a major political party be held responsible for maintaining their relationship to it, if some to many of their fellow politicians engage in clearly unethical or inherently dishonest acts that their party allows? By national-level I mean House, Senate or White House. Although this question is general, the example is American, hence the flair.  Here's an example.  Although I do not agree with all of his policies, beliefs, and outside-of-politics affiliations, I believe that Republican Senator Mitt Romney is at his heart an "ethical" politician who votes on matters according to his principles.  ^((I realize that many would argue against this, but please bear with me, and use some other example if that's not one you will accept.))  Despite this, he remains in the same party as a number of other prominent politicians in the House of Representatives that have clearly behaved in unprofessional, if not outright unethical, ways. Some of these politicians' actions appear to be more in service to themselves than they are to their constituents, and those actions do not align with the communicated policies of their party, and/or are directly fraudulent in some cases, and/or are directly in conflict with their oaths of office.  And it often seems to be the case that those politicians suffer no consequences for their inappropriate behaviour, because their party does not discipline them for it.  Should Senator Romney be justifiably critiqued for his continued membership to a party that does not discipline its members who are engaging in these acts, despite not participating in them himself?  Or is it acceptable as a "necessary evil" given that he might not be able to serve the people that elected him, and perform the tasks they elected him to do, equally as well, if he somehow changed his party affiliation? (If this is an incorrect assumption, please share what actions he could take that doesn't reduce this capability.)  In other words, is an ethical-person-among-unethical-people that desires to do an ethical job "trapped by circumstance", or are they "directly responsible for their choice" to stay in that environment?
How should non executive presidents be chosen? In presidential republics, the legitimacy of the actions of the president depend on a popular mandate or at least something somewhat close. Electoral colleges (which are not remotely unique to the US for the record, most of Latin America used them at some point) depended in most cases on some kind of votes tied to popular votes even if the formula is more byzantine than the First Crusade emperors. Many presidential republics nowadays even require a runoff with a majority to win and if nobody has a majority, the top two candidates go to a runoff where someone will have a majority.  But in systems where the president is not the principal executive, such as Italy, Portugal, Germany, Austria, Finland, Ireland, Iceland, India, Pakistan, Trinidad and Tobago, Malta, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, and many more, there is a wide variety of means to choose a president. They tend to do things like decide whether or not to dissolve parliament if a prime minister cannot be selected by a majority of the members of parliament or if a no confidence vote happens and they choose between new elections or letting someone else have a shot at trying to form a government. They might appoint a couple senators in their own discretion, they might appoint a minority of judges on a critical court, they may decide on whether to issue pardons (if the government consents), and other powers, and are often a moral authority above parties like when the Irish president roasts the parties in parliament for not coming to agreements on important things.  Malta just has the ordinary parliament appoint and dismiss them by a resolution passed by a majority of parliament with no secret ballot, but Austria and Finland have the same direct election with a runoff to guarantee a majority as most presidential republics these days. Germany and India plus some other places have electoral colleges where the electors themselves are the real deciders as to who should become president.   What are some of the pros and cons of each system and what is in your opinion the best application of them?
Which presidential candidate would you vote for in historic US elections? (Assuming you do not have knowledge of the events that will transpire during their presidencies, ie Watergate and other major events) When I say historic US elections, I refer to elections that you could not vote in, not necessarily elections you were not alive for. I feel that this hypothetical has much potential to encourage deep and rich discussions about politics and history, so I figured I'd give a shot at asking.
Using just data back statements, providing context, and removing emotional rhetoric, is it possible to support your political position? With so many buzz words: Open borders, indoctrination,    socialism,  radical agendas...  One wonders if a political candidate can support their position, and that of their supporters with data supported facts, removed from rhetoric.
How should the vote to avert the rail strike be viewed after the derailment in East Palestine? To give some context into the vote, [80 senators voted Yea, 15 Nay, 4 absent and 1 Present](https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1172/vote_117_2_00372.htm#position). This was pretty bipartisan in terms of both of its Yea's and Nays, but ultimately what happened was that it became illegal for the rail union to collectively strike. This happened on December 1st of 2022.  On February 4, 2023, a train derailed in East Palestine Ohio, spilling much toxic waste into the local community, with effects to only present themselves in the year to come.  Many criticisms have been placed on congress and Biden that many safety concerns weren't even addressed in the original bill that was not passed through, as it only gave more paid sick leave.  How do you personally view this vote after the disaster that occurred in East Palestine?
What do US Law Enforcement Agencies really believe about gun control policy? Given the grotesque amounts of shootings in cities, and therefore the higher risk that they will be shot in the line of duty, how significant is the group that proposes gun control? It's logical, and no doubt logical LEA members support removing guns as an effective means of reducing danger and tension.   One little publicly discussed fact about police shootings (does not excuse, but must be taken into consideration) is that police are often scared to death that someone they pull over will be packing. It's a zero sum game that can be ameliorated if effective gun control measures were put in place.
Future of Iran’s regime This year was a tough one for Iranians; from killing of Mahsa Amini to unbelievable decrease in the value of our currency Rial.  Today one US dollar is equal to 600,000 Iranian rials. Most of people are frightened.   What do you think about the future of Iran? What do you suggest for Iranians to do inside the country?
U.S. is becoming increasingly concerned about China's involvement in the Ukrainian war and particularly whether China will support Russia with arms and ammunition. U.S. has promised serious consequences if China does so. Can U.S. deter China from supporting Russia? China officially speaks of peaceful resolution of the war in Ukraine and claims to have taken a neutral position.  The U.S. and its global allies \[however\] have become increasingly concerned about [China's closer relations with Russia](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/china-russia-nuclear-weapons-nato-us-japan-south-korea-australia-new-zealand/). Moscow and Beijing insist it has nothing to do with other nations, but experts say the very public forging of ties between the two countries is unquestionably a message to the United States.  One of the biggest and most immediate concerns is that [Beijing could start providing weapons](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/antony-blinken-china-russia-lethal-support-ukraine-face-the-nation/) and or ammunition — lethal support — to help boost Russia's war on Ukraine.  "China is already supporting Russia's war-making machine," said McMaster, noting Beijing's increased purchase of Russian oil — 60% more, he said, over the last year. "So, they're feeding Putin… to keep the war going."  "They also are providing microelectronics and other materials that have led the U.S. Commerce Department to blacklist a large number of Chinese companies already," McMaster added. He said the question now for Xi is whether it's worth going "all-in with Russia" and risking his country's vital economic ties with the West.  "That incident, combined with Wang Yi's criticism of the United States and now his trip to Russia… it clearly has crossed that threshold into a new type of Cold War," said Medeiros.  China has not shied away from opportunities to flex its military power alongside Russia's. On Wednesday, the two nations [launched joint military exercises along with South Africa](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-china-south-africa-military-exercise-during-ukraine-war-no-hypersonic-missile-test/) off that country's coast. U.S. officials have voiced concern over the timing of the war games, coinciding with the one-year mark of Russia's ongoing assault on Ukraine.  Can U.S. deter China from supporting Russia?
What soured US/China relations since the historic ties established by Mao/Zhou Enlai and Nixon/Kissinger? The row over China's surveillance balloons and China's secret military support of Putin's war against Ukraine seem to have placed China/US relations at a low point. I am not familiar with any great controversy during the Obama administration or any among earlier presidents.  No doubt the match of Mao/Zhou and Nixon/Kissinger was a once in a blue moon opportunity. Both sides saw the long view and understood the realpolitik of the moment. Both sides put aside contention over Taiwan to create a meaningful relationship which was advantageous to both countries' long term interests, and against Russia's.  But then what happened?
Will the US/UK special relationship last? What keeps it together and what could disrupt it? While wonderful PR, and certainly true, no doubt this special relationship is based on mutual political interests. The UK had no choice but to tie itself to the US in deeper and deeper fashion in the aftermath of the two world wars.   Today, their interests remain tied economically, and bad in national security (the threat of Russia and China, namely). But while this is also the case between the US and France, for instance, I don't know the relationship to be as close. I'm interested in the perspectives of those who know more intimately.
Marianne Williamson is Running for President - USA - 2024 Election [https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/marianne-williamson-confirms-2024-presidential-run-against-biden/ar-AA17RzhM](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/marianne-williamson-confirms-2024-presidential-run-against-biden/ar-AA17RzhM)     She had a short campaign for the 2020 election, after which she endorsed Sanders. This time she's starting much earlier, so maybe she'll be able to get more momentum.   Once she officially launches her campaign on March 4th, she'll be the most prominent candidate running.   The "against Biden" part is weird since he's not announced yet.   Williamson probably hopes that the Berniecrats will embrace her as the successor to Sanders.   [https://marianne2020.com/issues](https://marianne2020.com/issues) has her positions as of 2020.  What do you think of her running? Which of her positions do you support?
Would Nixon be considered a moderate in the present-day GOP? Whilst Nixon may have had character flaws and was the only President to resign in disgrace, some of his actions would be considered moderate in the present-day GOP.  He created the Environmental Protection Agency and signed the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act and, Mammal Marine Protection Act, Endangered Species Act into law. He understood the need to reduce pollution and preserve natural resources. This starkly contrasts the current GOP, which denies climate change and wants to roll back on environmental protections.  He created Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which regulated workplace safety. The current GOP want to reduce the powers of OSHA, as demonstrated when they were against the OSHA vaccine mandate.  He advocated for lowering the voting age to 18 and signed it into law. This expansion in voting rights is the opposite of what the current GOP advocate wants to restrict voting to minorities and increase the voting age to 21.  He supported civil rights, reducing discrimination and segregation. He supported the Civil Rights act and the Voting Rights act. Although, This was before he employed the Southern Strategy in the late 60s. The present-day GOP, especially some factions, tend to support white supremacy.  He supported the Equal rights amendment (not ratified), which would have banned gender-based discrimination. Republicans in Congress have voted against it in procedural votes to revive its ratification.  He signed the 1972 Social Security Amendments, which expanded social security. The current GOP want to privatise social security and abolish it.  He nominated justices who varied from liberal, to moderate to conservative. Some of whom ruled in favour of Roe in Roe v Wade. Currently, both parties only nominate justices who side with their views.  He advocated for Keynesian economics, which meant government spending to take the country out of recession. Republicans nowadays want to reduce the size of the federal government.  He implemented the War on Drugs, a conservative policy; most of his policies would be considered moderate in the GOP.
What are your thoughts on the Syrian Civil War? So with the disastrous earthquakes in Turkey and Syria, it looks like Syria is finally back in the media limelight again, which prompted me to start thinking about the conflict that’s happening there again. If you’ve been following geopolitics/conflict news for a while, then chances are you went through at least one phase in the past 10 years or so where you were practically obsessed with this conflict. As for me? Well, I never really left that phase, haha. Though it’s calmed down significantly in the past couple of years, I’m sure that many of you still think about it from time to time.  So, what are your overall thoughts on the Syrian Civil War? How much do you know about it? Which side/sides do you support, if any? If you’re not from the USA, has it affected your country? If so, how? Do you foresee an end to this conflict in the near future?
Why are Republicans much more hardline on China compared to Russia? It seems that Republicans especially those on the right of the party are much more hardline on China compared to Russia. Some Republicans are actually sympathetic to Russia as demonstrated by their lack of support for Ukraine and praising of Putin. This seems unusually as both countries, which are America’s biggest adversaries, operate very similarly.   They are both authoritarian, one party states ruled by a strongman (Putin and Xi).  They want to take territorial sovereignty of Ukraine (Russia) and Taiwan (China).  They have strong censorship and crackdown on dissenters.   They crack down on minorities such as LGBTs (Russia)or Muslims (Xinjiang).  Republicans have been quite vocal on the actions of the Chinese government such as condemning their crackdowns in Hong Kong, Xinjiang. They have condemned how the Chinese government has handled the coronavirus including the government’s action against protestors. They have been more concerned about China taking Taiwan compared to Russia taking Ukraine. They have accused Biden of being too soft on China which was demonstrated during the spy balloon incidents.  Republicans have been quiet on Russia and some want to stop funding the war in Ukraine. It seems contradictory as the GOP seem to condemn the actions, rightly, of the Chinese government but seem to condone action taken by Russia. On the other hand, Democrats seem to be more hardline against Russia compared to China.
Why do Democrats do so much better in Montana than the other rural Western states? By "rural Western states," I'm referring to Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming and Idaho.  Here are the 2020 presidential election result from these states:  Idaho: (R) 63.8% (D) 33.1% Spread: (R) 30.7%  Montana: (R) 56.9% (D) 40.5% Spread: (R) 16.4%  North Dakota: (R) 65.1% (D) 31.8% Spread: (R) 33.3%  South Dakota: (R) 61.8% (D) 35.6% Spread: (R) 26.2%  Wyoming: (R) 69.9% (D) 26.6% Spread: (R) 43.3%  Montana also has a Democratic senator right now (Jon Tester) and had Democratic governors during 2005-2021.  Montana is pretty red, but Democrats perform markedly better there than the surrounding states, and I can't figure out why. I thought maybe Montana has a large American Indian population, but it doesn't compared to ND and SD. All of them are about 10%. Do we know why Montana is pretty Democratic given its place in the region?
What is the probability that US commitment to NATO and for Ukraine will falter after the elections or somewhere in the future? There is a constant underlying anxiety here in Europe that Putin will succeed in dividing us apart in our support for Ukraine and to upheave the rules based international order (Including when it comes to Chinese ambitions but that's not the topic here). It was painfully apparent when Trump was elected president before and I think many here in Europe is afraid it might happen again at a worse time. I get the feeling that Biden is not a very popular president for the US voters, even if he's well liked amongst your allies here in Europe.   What is the probability that a more isolationist candidate will take over? I feel that losing US support would be devastating for European unity as well. Having your country at our backs helps us feeling emboldened and more united. Since, tragically, we in Europe are mostly bickering otherwise.
Why is the "Actually, Y is bad too" excuse so common in online discourse? Whenever an argument regarding, for example, a politician and their shortcomings is happening, there will always be someone on the opposing side who, seemingly as a subconscious attempt at justifying said politician, will suddenly chime in about how the opposing side is no better.   For example, as I struggle describing it:  OP: "X is bad because ___"  Person who supports X: "Well Y is bad/worse" (no justification for counter-argument)  In my opinion, it almost seems to me like damage control resulting in an automatic response where you feel inclined to support "your team" when they fall under scrutiny, even if you can't provide valid points to defend said team. I wonder if there is a name/term for it and if there is a particular reason this is so common.  Let me know your thoughts or experiences with this phenomenon in the comments.  Edit: some very helpful folk in the comments have provided me with the correct term for this. apparently it's called whataboutism
What realistically are the broad scenarios that will allow the war to end in russia? Reading the BBC report today that about 75% of Russian adults over 40 years old support the war and the number is only 62% for those under 40, regardless Putin has no incentive to stop the war because he maintains the broad support of his people. Russia has subjected its people to horrible conditions for generations, and so despite sanctions, it doesn't really change much for the ordinary Russian people.   The sanctions target the oligarchs of course, but they have enough money that it will not affect their support of the war. Internationally Russia is losing long term revenue from the sale of oil and gas, the international financial system has kicked them out, and they will be weaker than ever before. Yet Russia, to the Russians, is still a part of the international community, since the IOC and other bodies failed to kick them out in protest against their war. The IOC could have sent a strong message had they done so.   It's clear from international reports that Putin has never veered from his talking points charade of requiring the West to make concessions while never offering any of his own to reduce aggression against Ukraine.  So until a significant shift takes place, Putin has no incentive to back down against his losing war. This battle may go on for years and over many different presidents and prime ministers. So I wonder what it will take to end this war, in broad but realistic and critically relevant means? Here is all I can think of, spitballing.  1. Ukraine amasses superior firepower to the point that they retake their territory from Russia, including the Donbas, but also Crimea. This would make it impossible for Russia to perceive success, but would also force Putin to up the stakes.   2. The international community, under the leadership of the US, use this opportunity to strengthen the UN's governing capability. I don't know what this means, but I see this as key. It would require greater commitment by China which would be loathe to support, but the added pressure would make Putin's ventures more difficult.   3. Putin over reaches. With reports that he is to take over Moldova as well as Belarus, and undoubtedly other countries, this could spread his network to thin and force greater fissures. I only hope he has a greater lapse in judgment and goes for it, if he sees Ukraine as impossible.   4. Putin dies.   I'm curious to know what realistic outcomes there are. Please share your thoughts.
What would a “national divorce” even look like? Red states make up the middle of the country, and blue states make up the edges. How would this even work? Here are some questions to consider.  1.) Who gets the nukes?  2.) Who keeps the constitution?  3.) Who keeps the name “United States”?  4.) Where would the blue states put their capital if they are cut in half?  5.) Would the red states let the blues use their airspace to commute to the other side, or would the blues have to route all flights over Canada?  6.) Would the blues even stick together, or would we get two different blue countries? 7.) Is there any scenario where this is done through a referendum, or would this genuinely be an all out war?
What are your thoughts of Vladimir Putin's most recent speech? Russian President Vladimir Putin delivered a speech that expressed his perception of a looming big war, stating that he feels threatened by the west. Putin highlighted the fact that the United States has bases around the world, which he claims is necessary to protect against countries that are building up military forces within their borders. He accused the west of lies, claiming that they are the ones who attacked, and seeing the Americans as dividing the world.  During his speech, Putin's tone was aggressive, and he presented a false narrative, denying Russia's attack on Ukraine and blaming the United States for the ongoing conflict. Putin justified his attack on Ukraine by accusing America of taking over. In addition, a woman in the crowd was wearing a blazer with the Z symbol on the right arm, which is no different from the Nazi symbol and is aimed to unite the people around a single ideology.  Putin reiterated that the longer the west continues to act in Ukraine, the longer they will be forced to avert danger approaching their borders. He added that Russia will logically respond to this. Putin emphasized that Russia is speaking about the existence of their country, which he claims is under threat.  During the speech, Putin also made an alarming comment suggesting that it's normal for people to be pedophiles in their countries, stating that "It's their way of life." Putin brought in religious quotes to unite his people with religion.  The speech delivered by Putin, with its false claims and divisive language, is seen by many as an example of wartime propaganda, intended to manipulate and control public opinion.

Why is the Idea of Sunset Clauses so Controversial? For those unaware of what I'm referring to, there have been a variety of proposals, the most of notable of which have been created by Senator Rick Scott of Florida, to set all legislation to sunset five years after passage. What that would mean is that five years after passage, all legislation would have to be passed again to remain in effect.   This idea has received a lot of controversy, President Biden has criticized the idea, saying its an attempt to repeal Social Security and Medicare. However, unless the people elect Representatives and Senators who support repeal those services, they'd just be re-passed and remain in effect.   In light of this, why is there so much controversy with sunset clauses? If the people want certain pieces of legislation to remain, they'll just elect leaders who support that legislation.
Would the US be better served with ranked choice voting? On its face, ranked choice voting seems simple enough. Rank candidates for a position of power in order of most preferred to least preferred. The ballots are counted for people's number one choice, and if no candidate gets over 50% of the votes, the ballots who had the candidate with the fewest rank one votes have their votes switched to their second choice and the ballots are counted again. This process repeats until a candidate gets over 50% of the votes.  Is there some great shortcoming that ranked choice voting has that the first past the post system most US states currently use doesn't have?
a 4th branch Curious to know your thoughts. What could a 4th branch of government be in America and what would it look like in relationship to the 3? For example could it be a moral agency or Supreme Ethics / Cultural Executive Office of some kind to maintain balance in culture?? Should culture be seen as an institution that needs a check and balance so it's not a threat to democracy??   I could only wonder how a 2-party system might play into it. Maybe every 4 years elect 2 Officers to lead The Committee one from each party and under their cabinent have 'Cultural Representatives (or delegates of some kind) to be changes in culture for the good.
Could the USSR have been maintained, and saved under Gorbachev? Or was it far too late? Kissinger noted that had Gorbachev began Glasnost (political liberalization) and Perestroika (economic restructuring) a decade earlier, they could have succeeded in keeping the USSR viable. However, Russia was already going down a death spiral due to institutionalized fragility and poor economic planning. The KGB recognized more than anyone how politically and economically unsustainable the communist policies of the USSR were, because it was their job to analyze the state of the USSR and foreign countries. Brezhnev's commitment to an arms race USSR couldn't pay for, and his control of satellite nations the USSR couldn't manage, created a situation which Gorbachev could not manage because it was largely out of the USSR's ability to do so by that point.  Yet, no doubt many singularly blame him for the fall of the USSR, blaming Glasnost and Perestroika among other policies for giving satellite nations state actors the ability to break off and do their own thing. This is a summation of what Kissinger explained.  Gorbachev was no doubt bold in his attempts at reform, and no doubt since his innovative early days significantly growing output of crops in his homeland of Stavropol, he was known as a reformer. I imagine many discerning Politburo members understood the USSR needed reform, even if they didn't know how or what needed to be reformed. Was there any way Gorbachev could have succeeded at such a Herculean task?
Margorie-Taylor Greene has called for a 'national divorce'. Should she remain on the Homeland Security Committee? [Tweet](https://twitter.com/mtgreenee/status/1627665203398688768):  >We need a national divorce.  > We need to separate by red states and blue states and shrink the federal government. >  > Everyone I talk to says this. >  > From the sick and disgusting woke culture issues shoved down our throats to the Democrat’s traitorous America Last policies, we are done.  Is a call for dissolving the United States and secession grounds for action in today's Congress?  Congress formally established the Homeland Security Committee as a standing committee in 2005 to ensure that the American people were protected from terrorist attacks. The committee focuses on legislation and oversight related to the security of the United States.  Marjorie Taylor-Greene was previously [removed](https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/17/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-paul-gosar-committee-assignments/index.html) from all committees under the Democratic House in the 117th Congress.  She was granted a Homeland Security committee spot under the Republican House in the 118th Congress.   For context, Marjorie Taylor Greene's previous removal was largely based on comments she made before becoming a Representative.  These include:  * a campaign ad where she shot and killed feral hogs, after referring to Democrats as an infestation of feral hogs allowed to roam free and destroy the American countryside * calls to execute then House Speaker Pelosi * liking Facebook comments that said the quickest solution to removing Pelosi would be "a bullet to the head" * ads featuring her holding a gun alongside a caption that read "the Squad's worst nightmare"
Biden in Kyiv, Ukraine. What if Russia attacked? I saw in a news article this morning that Biden was visiting Kyiv, Ukraine and that got me thinking about a Russian attack.  If Russia was to attack Kyiv while Biden was there (whether Russia knew he was there or not) and he was hurt or killed, would that be considered any kind of declaration of war between Russia and the US?  If they knew he was there then it could probably be considered an assassination by the Russian government. If they didn't know he was there, they still would have injured or killed the sitting US president in a war that nearly every other country is against.  In that same boat, could other countries use that as a tool to help Ukraine? If Ukraine was concerned about a certain city being bombed, could a President, Prime Minister, etc.. just make an announced visit to that city to prevent Russia from attacking and potentially killing a high-ranking official of a NATO country? Obviously this would be a big risk for the person using themselves as a defense, but I'm just curious if anything like this has been used or could be used successfully.
Will Pennsylvania ban political bribery? **Pennsylvania just introduced its 34th gift ban proposal**, which would be a common-sense bill that prohibits public officers, public employees, and candidates for public office from accepting cash in any amount and any gift that costs more than $50 from any one person in a calendar year.   What do we think? **Will they ban political bribery?**  Currently, there are no limits on what lobbyists can give to public officials in Pennsylvania. Gifts valued at over $250, or $650 for travel, lodging, and hospitality must be reported, but there is no meaningful enforcement for failure to report gifts. Lobbyists use gifts to get what they want from the government and destroy trust between the People and the Legislature.   \---> Read more here: [https://www.penncapital-star.com/government-politics/expecting-extraordinary-action-this-session-gift-ban-advocates-hope-for-legislative-action/](https://www.penncapital-star.com/government-politics/expecting-extraordinary-action-this-session-gift-ban-advocates-hope-for-legislative-action/)
Is it Time to Rethink How We Elect Representatives in the House of Representatives? The issue of gerrymandering has long been a point of contention in American politics, with some arguing that it undermines the principles of fair representation in government. With this in mind, is it time to explore electing representatives based on factors other than current system of districting?   Age could be a useful criterion for choosing representatives, as it's an objective variable that's not affected by subjective factors such as gender or race. Instead of using geographical districts, a certain number of representatives would be allocated to each age group based on the number of electors in the state and the size of each age group.  What do people on Reddit think of this?
Is Constant Economic Growth Possible? Is it Desirable? Economic growth (usually measured in GDP) has long been associated with good government and progress. Politicians often tout strong economic growth under their leadership and attack opponents for poor economic growth under theirs.  With many countries experiencing an aging population, fear of automation and environmental concerns, many wonder if consistent economic growth is possible in the coming decades.  What are the pros and cons associated with economic growth? Does an increase in economic activity always correspond to an improved quality of life? Can this system be upheld indefinitely, or should other ideas be considered?
What is your opinion on ballot harvesting? Currently, in the United States of America, 36 states allow someone other than the voter to bring their vote to the ballot box. Some of these states have certain designated people that can harvest ballots, while others allow the voters to select the person they want to turn in their ballot for them.  Proponents of this policy say that it makes the voting process easier for people who may not have the time or physical ability to go vote. Opponents say that it gamifies the voting process by simply making elections about who can collect the most ballots instead of who can motivate people to go out and vote for them.  What are your thoughts on this? Should ballot harvesting be illegal? Should there be more restrictions on the process? Are there any other related ideas you have for fortifying the election process?
Is Pete Buttigeg handling the East Palestine situation well? I hear republicans attacking him, saying he isn’t doing enough to help. Is this true? Can someone provide perspective for why or why not?  This is the first question I want an answer to.  Also, saw Trent Conway, Mayor of East Palestine on Fox News attacking him by saying ‘Pete will just start a circus if he’s involved, unless he’ll bring a shovel and get rid of the contaminated soil.  Is Trent Conway’s criticism of Buttigeg a testament to Pete’s failure, or is the a partisan reason for why he is insulting Pete?  That is my second question.  Also, republicans are criticizing Pete because he pointed out there are thousands of train detailing a per year, saying he downplaying this situation irresponsibly. Is that an accurate assessment, or do you disagree?
Should the Supreme Court be able to overturn federal statutes? One thing I've been wondering about after the overturning of Roe v. Wade is whether SCOTUS's power of judicial review is constitutional. Also, I wondered if Congress is the governmental body best suited for reviewing whether a law is outdated or unconstitutional since it represents the voices of the majority, and in a democracy, the people should determine which laws get to be passed and overturned. What do y'all think?
If Ron DeSantis is the GOP presidential nominee will more lower level candidates describe themselves as DeSantis Republicans, much like how many became Trump MAGA Republicans? Over the course of Trump's 2016 nomination, his presidency, and current re-election bid many Republican office holders or would be candidates came to describe themselves as Trump Republicans or MAGA candidates. They pledged loyalty to Trump even if he didn't respond in kind. They echoed his call to push for MAGA and spoke of the only "real" Republicans were ones who had embraced MAGA.  Now, if Florida gov. DeSantis defeats Trump fair and square will most Republicans, including those previous loyal to MAGA and Trump, look to DeSantis as their standard bearer? I'm not saying they'll lose their affection for Trump, but as office holders and prospective candidates will they decide to lean into what DeSantis is pushing for like against CRT, DEI, ESG, vax mandates, etc. and look to him as a leader?  Meaning, that a DeSantis endorsement in a GOP primary will have the same weight as a Trump endorsement did, but this time without the baggage that hurt Republicans in the general elections of 2018 through 2022? (election denialism)
How will Ron Desantis' political positions play at a national level? Ron Desantis is a top GOP Presidential candidate as we head into 2024.  There has been a lot of talk about how he might fare against Donald Trump in a GOP Primary matchup.  I have seen a lot less discussion about how he would play nationally to the greater US voting public, not just the Republican base.  While he certainly has a flavor of Trumpism, he is much more of a social conservative than Donald is. He is very likely to run on a variety of culture war issues such as being anti-vaccine, anti-Critical Race Theory, Restricting what can be taught to kids in the classroom, etc.  These types of culture war issues seem to have worked out fairly well for him in Florida, as he coasted to re-election as governor.  How will it play for him nationally should he be able to secure the GOP nomination?
Is Neoliberalism in the US dying? And if so, what socioeconomic do you see replacing it and when? A speculative notion I've taken special interest to in the past year surrounds that of Neoliberalism's possible decline, globally, and more specifically, in the United States. Though individual observations of key characteristics of Neoliberalism have been noticed to be challenged or transitioned away from by historians, political scientists, and economists alike, noticeably after the 2008-2009 economic crash, US historian Gary Gerstle has seemingly been the first, but certainly most notable figure, to wholly contextualize the destabilization of the free movement of money, people, information, & trade since then as an overall crisis and subsequent decline of Neoliberal political order. In the US, Gerstle attributes the 2016 election and the rise of right & left wing populism in the forms of Donald Trump & Bernie Sanders to have been the origin point of politics' reaction to the increased strain & severity trickle down economics had reaped amongst the broad populace. Since the inauguration of the former as president and into that of the current Biden administration, noticeable streaks of economic protectionism, attempts at stricter border laws & corporate regulation, and now a gradually searing attempt to regulate the power and influence of tech giants and their services, have manifested into US law & political discourse among both parties, largely uncharacteristic of prior Neoliberal governance. Gerstle believes the US to be in transition towards a new political status quo, which explains for the increasing disorder the country has been in since 2008. As the old guard fades out, the new still struggles to be born (he compares to the similar past crises of the 1920s/30s & the 1970s and even compares Biden to being like a Jimmy Carter-type figure). Though I do not believe Trump & Biden to be the completive harbingers of a new right & left wing era competing for each's attempt at reshaping things wholly, I do see them as transitional figures who've attempted to restructure through modest breaks away from previous political organization, possibly giving glimpses to new pathways for their successors on each side. With Trump, ethnonationalist authoritarianism, and with Biden, New Deal-inspired social democracy (absorbing plenty of Bernie's Democratic Socialist ideas).  &#x200B;  So, do you personally believe we are living in Neoliberalism's final days, and if so (or not), what do you think awaits us in the coming decade? I've long wanted to survey this topic in this sub!
Why are Mansions Taxes based on price instead of property size? The mansion tax starts at any single, multi-family, apt, condo that sells for 1,000,000 in NYC. In New York for that price you get nothing near a mansion. Should the tax be reformed to be based on the property size that fits the definition of mansion instead of the selling price?   Right now you could buy the same property for $990,000 and not have the tax but if it is sold for 1,000,000 it has the 1% tax, which is $10,000.
Justifying Restrictions to Freedom of Information In certain countries, like Egypt, China, Iran and Russia there is obvious restrictions to freedom of information - whether it be social media or the press or general information on government.  What arguments can defend this? For example, Muslim dominated countries say social media erodes traditional cultures and values.  I’m interested in how the other side sees it.
Judge McBurney previously ordered portion directly implicating Trump's attempt to upend the 2020 Georgia elections withheld. Does the abbreviated release [2/16/23] shed any light on potential charges against Trump [if any], the DA may present to a new jury? Weeks earlier, \[Tuesday, January 24, 2022\] Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis suggested that the special grand jury investigating [Donald Trump](https://www.cnn.com/specials/politics/president-donald-trump-45) and his allies’ efforts to upend the 2020 election in Georgia had recommended multiple indictments and said that her decision on whether to bring charges is “imminent.”  Multiple media outlets at that time wanted the final grand jury report to be released and more recently \[Feb. 13, 2023\], Judge Robert C.I. McBurney ordered a partial release; In his eight-page ruling, he said he had to prioritize the public's right to know about at least the general findings of the probe into the attempts to overturn the 2020 election.  McBurney, however, noted that any recommendations for criminal charges, which [may include the former president](https://www.newsweek.com/fulton-county-grand-jury-could-necessary-ammo-prosecuting-trump-1776268), will not be made public on Thursday.  Instead, McBurney said that the report's introduction and conclusion, which could give hints about a criminal recommendation, and a section that detailed concerns from the special grand jury that "some witnesses may have lied under oath during their testimony"—therefore committing perjury—can be released.  "Having reviewed the final report, the undersigned concludes that the special purpose grand jury did not exceed the scope of its prescribed mission," McBurney wrote. "Indeed, it provided the District Attorney with exactly what she requested: a roster of who should (or should not) be indicted, and for what, in relation to the conduct (and aftermath) of the 2020 general election in Georgia."  Noting this line, in McBurney's ruling, Georgia State University College of Law professor Anthony Michael Kreis then tweeted that ["the writing is on the wall"](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-fulton-county-georgia-readies-release-records-grand-jury-1780902) in regard to an indictment for Trump or his allies. Kreis said it may be "seems unlikely" that jurors would believe witnesses lied under oath and then not recommend charges be brought forward.  Does the abbreviated release \[2/16/23\] shed any light on potential charges against Trump \[if any\], the DA may present to a new jury?

What does the failure of the Hogwarts Legacy boycott tell us about the effectiveness of boycotts moving forward? Due to comments from J.K. Rowling, many have vigorously supported a boycott of the new Harry Potter game, Hogwarts Legacy. However, even before it was released last week, it was a best-selling and top-streamed game. If such a vocal movement stands against something to no apparent effect, what can we expect for the future of boycotts? Are they still effective tools of change in a global marketplace where appealing to even a small minority is enough to be widely successful?  Or was there something wrong with this boycott in particular? Was it just that the message didn't get out, that people just didnt care, or was the IP just too popular? Was it less effective because the actions of those involved (such as harassing streamers, spoiling the ending of the game, and lying about Rowling's comments and the game's content) were seen in a negative way?
Poll shows half of Americans believe news media is intentionally misleading AP News article: [https://apnews.com/article/television-news-media-business-4367fdad2d6ce6c2c455195f9dfef908](https://apnews.com/article/television-news-media-business-4367fdad2d6ce6c2c455195f9dfef908)  Underlying report: [https://knightfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/American-Views-2022-Pt-2-Trust-Media-and-Democracy.pdf](https://knightfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/American-Views-2022-Pt-2-Trust-Media-and-Democracy.pdf)  Highlights:  * 26% of Americans have a favorable opinion of the news media * 35% of Americans say most national news organizations can be relied on to deliver the information they need. * 23% believe most national news organizations care about the best interests of their readers, viewers and listeners. * 50% feel most national news organizations intend to mislead, misinform or persuade the public. * 50% say there is so much bias in the news media that it is often difficult to sort out the facts. * Perceptions of political bias in news coverage have also increased, with independents driving the trend, followed by Republicans, then Democrats. * 71% of those with low emotional trust in national news organizations believe that the people who really "run" the country are unknown to the voters; only 46% of those with high trust believe this. * 65% of those with low emotional trust in national news organizations think official government accounts of events cannot be trusted, while only 22% of those with high trust say so. * Americans with lower emotional trust in national news are much less likely to value the opinions of experts than those with high emotional trust. * 70% of Americans with high emotional trust in national news organizations believe elections are free and fair, just 22% of those with low emotional trust say the same.  The news media is the fourth estate or the fourth pillar of our democracy, so these low levels of trust are alarming indeed. We rely on the media to accurately report the actions of our government and hold them to account.  The reason for my posting this is: What is causing this decline in America's trust of national media?  Are national media truly being corrupted and used to push one agenda or another? Are social media echo chambers causing Americans to reject contradictory information when they encounter it? Are politicians and political influencers trying to undermine trust for their own ends?  I think the answer to all those questions is 'yes' to some degree, but I'm curious what others think about it.
Is Scotland better off remaining with a Union with U.K or Is it better to seek full independence and join E.U ? Both Scotland and England have been in an Union for 400 years  forming Great Britain. In the last referendum of independence, one of the major points of the No side is that U.K was part of E.U and ot would major bureaucratic snd economic  hurdle for Scotland to leave UK then join EU .   Now with U.k out of the EU for at least a decade , do you think it is better of Scotland to go independent and join E.U or remain part of U.K ?
Iran and the Nuclear Deal The Iran Nuclear Deal - or the JCPOA.  I know most of the international community would restoration of the nuclear deal but what does Iran want?  What alternatives would the Iranian community/government want?  If something were to be proposed to the UN that Iran would support what would it look like?
The Vulnerable World Hypothesis (or, my Technological Context idea has an academic brother) So, I was debating on a forum when one of the members posted a link to this paper: [Vulnerable World Hypothesis](https://nickbostrom.com/papers/vulnerable.pdf).  &#x200B;  The core analogy of this hypothesis is rather simple:  1. Humanity has been taking technology from what is termed the 'Urn of Creativity', and each technology is a colored ball. 2. Said urn has produced -so far- two types of balls -i.e., technologies- that are colored white -wholly beneficial- and grey -weaponizable/mixed bag in terms of benefits- throughout the length of human history. 3. There is a strong possibility of 'black' balls -i.e., inherently disruptive technologies- in the urn. 4. There is a strong possibility that we will pull a 'black' ball ***soon***. 5. Civilization will fall if in an environment that can't preemptively stop groups of people from using these disruptive technologies. 6. The only way to keep civilization afloat is, essentially, an electronic panopticon. Other options are infeasible or have their own problems.    1. Note, the price tag to set up such a panopticon is \~140 USD per person at the time of the paper, or to do it to the entire human population is less than 1% of the world's GDP.    2. In addition to ensuring that 5 is prevented, it makes law enforcement's job easier to do. 7. The problem is that the current political environment is against an electronic panopticon, though subconsciously, we're going for such a scenario anyway.  So, in summary, we're in a situation where the only viable way to keep civilization around is both a) being subconsciously implemented and b) politically hated, and we're literally playing with the dice -and thus, gambling with the future- when it comes to technology, hoping that we're going to get a white or grey ball instead of a black one even though the odds are against it.  &#x200B;  Let's have a discussion about this, shall we?
The Evans Commission version of the Right to Protect (R2P), which states that a Regional Military Alliance can carryout military interventions in their own region without the authorization of the UN Security Council. This is what justified NATO to intervene in Serbia and Yugoslavia in the 1990s. Could Russia have done this with Ukraine under the guise of the Collective Security Treaty Organization and with the purpose of 'humanitarian intervention'? Would the 'intervention' be seen as legitimate and/or would there be the same large backlash from the West as we're seeing right now?
Was Obama a good president? Was Trump a good president? Answer these questions with your interpretation of what good means. As a foreigner I find it really hard to get an honest view on the US presidencies. Everything is so polarized in the US. You either hear Obama is a hero and socialist or he is the devil himself. About Trump you hear that he is the worst president and compulsive liar, also the devil or you hear that he is a hero, almost Jesus-like, and undid all of Obamas "mistakes". Can someone give us a more unpolarized view of what exactly each president did for the people? What were good decisions what were bad decisions? Why and to whom where they good/ bad? What exactly did the decision entail, so we have actual proof of actions towards their campaign promises. And if you want to give a polarized answer, then at least back it up with facts. And what were things that everybody (democrats, republicans) does agree on were good/ bad decisions?   I would really like to hear some perspective, because trying to look it up, some call Obama the worst president of history, others call Trump that and usually it's the other party. What do outsiders think that are not involved?  Let's have a nice and civil discussion folks :)
With today’s CPI report, is a soft landing (inflation recovery without recession) now out of the question? How will it affect the 2024 election? Basically the price index only went down slightly and consumer prices actually rose by about half a percent, breaking a streak in declines. It’s a very mixed bag of a report that indicates recovery won’t be a straight line and the Fed will raise rates more. Is a recession likely? How will this impact Biden’s re-election?
How would the Republican Party react if Ron DeSantis loses to Biden in 2024? Ron DeSantis has got a massive boost in his national profile since he easily won re-election in November. He has since been viewed by many as the candidate that can win the suburbs back for the GOP and unite conservatives who aren't big fans of Trump with Trump supporters. If he ends up defeating Donald Trump in the GOP primary but fails to defeat Biden, how would the GOP react?
If he wasn't assassinated, would Bobby Kennedy have beaten Richard Nixon in the '68 Presidential Election? Following JFK's truncated presidency via assassination, many assumed his brother Robert would be the new face of the Democratic Party, who had already made quite a name for himself as United States Attorney General during his brother's presidency. Bobby was one of the front runners for the Democratic candidacy, until he himself was assassinated in the months leading up to the 1968 election. Hubert Humphrey would eventually get the nomination and be defeated in an electoral landslide by Richard Nixon. (Nixon also won the popular vote, albeit only by about 500,000 votes).  Had he survived the assassination and gone on to be named the Democratic candidate, how would Bobby Kennedy have fared against Tricky Dick?
Will the humanitarian fallout after the recent Syrian~Turkey earthquake spark a change in the use of international sanctions? Information coming from Syria itself is scarce, however people have seen first hand the devastation caused in Turkey, and the struggles with recovery, rescues, clean up, etc. Over 35,000 already confirmed dead, 100's of thousands displaced, all this on top of the estimated([World Vision](https://www.worldvision.org/disaster-relief-news-stories/2023-turkey-and-syria-earthquake-faqs#fast-facts)) 6.5million children already in need of humanitarian aid from the Syrian war. Sanctions have blocked aid and rescue efforts from entering Syria, long after the 5 day 'window of hope', we can only expect the loss of life to Syrians to be even greater.   Long have economic sanctions been used as alternatives to war, while their implementation or severity is often criticised as hurting the populace much more than the government. Critics cite the failures of decades long sanctions on Cuba, North Korea, Venezuela, or Iran, to force political change. Some critics going as far as to say sanctions are an act of war, as the entire population is impacted, not just the problematic govt.   Once information becomes available from inside Syria of the death toll, caused by this earthquake, and how this could have been reduced with timely aid and support, will this spark reform/review of the place sanctions hold as a tool for international relations? What changes do you envision occurring? If broad economy crippling trade sanctions are outlawed what measures would you envision taking their place?
What are the next states that realistically will flip blue? It is known that Democrats are targeting Texas and North Carolina in the next election cycle as they have been trending more and more blue and are looking more likely to flip blue within the next decade. Assuming Democrats manage to flip Texas and North Carolina, while also managing to hold on to purplish states like Virginia and Georgia, where should Democrats target after that?
Do you see Florida going blue any time soon? Once a major swing state, it appears that Florida has become a solid red state, with Trump winning the state in 2016 as well as 2020, along with the reelection of Ron DeSantis as governor in 2022. Obviously both are very controversial figures that cause people to either love or despise them.   Do you see this trend continuing or do you expect the state to swing back to purple, or even blue eventually?
Why did Ron DeSantis win re-election in Florida in a blowout when past gubernatorial races were often decided by single digits? Democrats used to be competitive in Florida gubernatorial elections. To wit…  &#x200B;  * 1998: R+10.6 * 2002: R+12.8 * 2006: R+7.1 * 2010: R+1.2 * 2014: R+1.0 * 2018: R+0.4 * 2022: R+19.4  &#x200B;  Why did Florida gubernatorial elections go from being decided by single digits from 2006 to 2018 to total Democratic annihilation in 2022? Did the state’s demographics change? Is it the state-level party apparatuses?
How much does a countries culture effect how well a political system would work? Is there much evidence or any examples of how much of a factor a nations cultures and traditions impact the effectiveness of political systems?  New to learning politics and in the thought of hypothetically implementing the “best” political system everywhere, what sort of differences would you expect amongst the nations?
Should there be laws that penalize elected officials for making false statements? One feature of US laws regarding publicly-trades companies is that their officials can be penalized for making false and misleading claims about their firms. Using this analogy to the extent that it can regarding politics, should we have similar laws that penalize politicians for making false statements? In this case, a false statements would be one that is provably not true; the concept of political speech would be treated more like commercial speech. If businesspeople can be punished for making false claims about their products or businesses, with the understanding that such false statements could adversely affect costumers, how are politicians not held to a similar standard since the stakes are so much greater?  Thanks.
Would a somewhat unknown state governor be a better pick for the Democratic Party than Biden? It seems the democrats might have a hard time nominating someone who doesn’t have a bunch of baggage. (Biden, Harris, Buttigieg) Perhaps it could be someone such as Andy Beshear, Josh Shapiro, or Jared Polis???
Will the recent earthquakes in Turkey help or hurt Erdogan in the upcoming Turkish elections? Obviously the entire situation is a tragedy and political impacts aren't at the top of things we should consider, but I do think it's worth talking about  It's important to note that Erdogan himself rose to power criticizing the Turkish govt for its poor earthquake preparations while he was mayor of Istanbul, now probably one of the greatest natural disasters in modern Turkish history has taken place under his watch, with many people dying preventable deaths due to poor building codes in Earthquake prone parts of the country  Will Erdogan suffer consequences for allowing such a catastrophic death toll to take place? Or will there be a rally around the flag effect as people appreciate his response? What will be the affects of the earthquake on him?
Based on current Real Clear Politics averages. If the election was held today, Donald Trump would win the Republican nomination and become President again. Thoughts? Take this with a massive grain of salt. It's February of 2023. There is a lifetime of politics to happen before the 2024 Presidential Election. I will say that the numbers are still interesting though. Real Clear Politics did do poorly on individual races in the 2022 midterms, however they got the generic ballot popular vote pretty good. They had an average of Republicans winning the popular vote by 2.5%. They won by 2.8%.  The current average of polling has Donald Trump ahead in the Republican Primary by 18.6%. The candidates listed are Trump (48.3%) DeSantis (29.7%) Pence (7.0%) Haley (3.7%) etc.  The Biden Vs. Trump dynamic has Trump up 1.7%. 45.0% to 43.3%. If those were the actual results, Donald Trump would become President.  I think one reason for this is that voters have grown less emotionally visceral towards Trump. He's been out of the spotlight somewhat to the average voter in the last two years and those raw emotions just aren't there. He's still unpopular, but not as unpopular. Biden on the other hand is the current President and emotions are more raw in the present.  Those are just some of my thoughts. I'll provide the links below. What do you think?  2024 Republican Nomination  [RealClearPolitics - Election 2024 - 2024 Republican Presidential Nomination](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2024/president/us/2024_republican_presidential_nomination-7548.html)  Biden Vs. Trump  [RealClearPolitics - Election 2024 - General Election: Trump vs. Biden](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2024/president/us/general-election-trump-vs-biden-7383.html)  2022 Generic Ballot   [RealClearPolitics - Election Other - 2022 Generic Congressional Vote](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/2022-generic-congressional-vote-7361.html) 
In one/dominant party states, what kind of options are there to protecting democratic values? Some places develop multi party systems, but others don´t, even when free elections are held. South Africa has no barriers to forming new parties and their electoral system is highly proportional, with no thresholds to gaining seats in the National Assembly or any provincial legislature or a municipal council, and many dozens of parties are registered, but ever since the end of Apartheid, they still have voted for the ANC consistently.  Angola is a similar case where since the end of the Civil War, the MPLA, yes, that MPLA, keeps getting rather large majorities, UNITA getting second place at about 20-40% of the seats in most cases. The ruling party of Mozambique is also in this camp. Tanzania also was a one party system from the 1960s to the 1990s, and then in 1990 they changed to a dominant party system with the CCM getting huge majorities, but ever since they turned into an official political party in 1980, their party leaders and ergo presidents have ruled extremely consistently for two terms of five years on the dot (except for that guy who died because of COVID early in his second term).  Not just an African phenomenon, Alberta in Canada very consistently operates with the Tory party, from the Social Credit to the Progressive Conservatives getting huge and uninterrupted majorities from 1935 to 1971 in the case of the Social Credits and from 1971 to 2015 for the PCs. In Bavaria, the CSU also gets big majorities and often majority governments even with proportional representation.  What options could be used in dominant party systems and I guess one party systems too to keep the political system interesting, to foster high turnout at elections, to avoid state capture by the ruling party, and to encourage competition for power, and to permit incumbents to be deposed if need be?   I also include popular fronts in the category of one party systems. China technically has hundreds of members of other parties in their national legislature and even dozens of such members their standing committee of the national legislature but all compete under a single banner which makes the election not really interesting or capable of removing the ruling party from power.
Allowing state seccession as a campaign promise (for a Republican) The Supreme Court ruled a state seceeding from the Union to be illegal (unconstitutional) but did not rule out an act of congress allowing it.  What kind of response would a candidate receive if this was their main campaigning point entering the Republican primaries?  Specifically - An act of congress to allow the citizens of a state to pass a state wide referendum to allow their state to secede from the Union and gain total independence.  That's it. Similar to how Trump was vague on the details of his border wall and Biden on Supreme Court revision, the candidate would claim (accurately) that the details would fall to Congress  Note- I ask about a Republican response as from historic and current data it is these states that favour sovereignty (states rights) as opposed to federal oversight. I fully believe.
Will Russia suffer any real consequences for war crimes? Obviously, Russia has been slapped with sanctions upon sanctions for their invasion of Ukraine, but will there be any additional punishments beyond sanctions for war crimes, or is it just going to be more sanctions?
What are some things we'll see with South Carolina being a focal point in 2028 as oppose to Iowa in the Democratic Primary? The 2024 Democratic Primary is unlikely to be super exciting. Joe Biden is likely running for re-election. There are rumblings that Marianne Williamson will present a primary challenge, but that is probably not going to be that substantial.  In 2028, the field is likely to be wide open. One thing that will be relevant in South Carolina as oppose to Iowa is the Jim Clyburn endorsement. Clyburn as of now is the only Democrat in congress representing South Carolina. He's been in office since the 1990s and was a key figure that catapulted Biden to the presidency. The other issue is racial makeup. Iowa has always been a rather white state being 89% white and 3% black. South Carolina on the other hand is more diverse. It's 66% white and 26% black. The other factor is that South Carolina is a rather conservative state. It is to the right of the country and is currently an R+8 state. I'm sure that'll be a factor in what kind of candidate succeeds in the state.  That's all I have for now. What are some things you expect to see with South Carolina being a focal point in Democratic Presidential Primaries?
Who was the most overrated or overappreciated president? Who was the most underrated or underappreciated president? We have had a lot of great presidents throughout our country's history, and we have also had some bad presidents. However, some presidencies get romanticized while other presidencies are deglamorized. Some presidents are over-credited for events they did not directly influence, while others do not gain the credit they deserve. I would like to know which presidents you think were the most overrated and which were the most underrated.
Population decline: Immigration may be the difference between shrinking economies and growing ones https://www.businessinsider.com/china-shrinking-population-worker-labor-shortage-grim-omen-global-economy-2023-2  China, with the world's largest population, is projected to shrink by nearly half at the end of this century if demographic trends continue. Europe and Japan are facing similar declines.   The US is the only country projected to grow this century, due primarily to immigration. Yet, some politicians want to limit immigration. Add to that the very real concerns about AI and automation destroying jobs, as well as climate change caused by modernization.   What might the world look like in eighty years if these trends continue? Will AI/automation and population decline balance out over time without severe economic consequences? What effects might immigration (or lack of) have on the world's economies?
What do you think of the One Democratic State solution in Palestine? The [“One Democratic State” solution](https://odsi.co) is a political proposal that identifies Zionism’s [politicization of identity](https://www.odsi.co/en/faq_depoliticize_identity) and establishment of a [Jewish state](https://www.odsi.co/en/faq_israel_not_democracy) as the root cause of suffering and violence in [Palestine](https://www.odsi.co/en/index#FAQ_land_name_palestine), and that, accordingly, proposes the transition to a secular, democratic, non-identitarian state in Palestine as the only possible solution.  As such, it stands in contrast with existing approaches to the Palestinian cause, namely:  * Identitarian solutions such as one Jewish state, one Arab state, one Jewish state + one Arab state, or one binational or confederate state * Approaches focused on means of liberation such as military resistance or BDS efforts outside the context of a political solution * Approaches focused on rights or crimes such as the right of return or Israeli apartheid outside the context of a political solution
How much does negativity bias in the media impact our perception of day-to-day life? Journalism is inherently biased towards negativity due to the fact that negative events, such as a shooting spree, war, or epidemic, are sudden and attention-grabbing, whereas positive developments, such as a decrease in crime, peace spreading, or an increase in life expectancy, are gradual and less exciting. How do you stay informed without succumbing to the feeling that everything is on the edge of catastrophe?
What was the greatest or most impactful speech in the history of the United States? Throughout American History, many great speeches have been given. However, some speeches are better than others, and it is challenging to determine the greatest. I would love to know what you all think was the greatest or most impactful speech in the history of America.
Seymour Hersch, Pulitzer Prize winning journalist writes in considerable detail U.S. planned and executed the attack on Nord Stream Pipelines. White House called the article a fiction. If true, will this cause dissonance with some of our allies and how will the world at large respond to this? According to the article, Last June, the Navy divers, operating under the cover of a widely publicized mid-summer NATO exercise known as [BALTOPS 22](https://www.navy.mil/Press-Office/News-Stories/Article/3066830/baltops-22-the-premier-baltic-sea-maritime-exercise-concludes-in-kiel/), planted the remotely triggered explosives that, three months later, destroyed three of the four Nord Stream pipelines, according to a source with direct knowledge of the operational planning.   In the immediate aftermath of the pipeline bombing, the American media treated it like an unsolved mystery. Russia was [repeatedly cited as a likely culprit](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/28/world/europe/pipeline-sabotage-mystery-russia.html), spurred on by calculated leaks from the White House—but without ever establishing a clear motive for such an act of self-sabotage, beyond simple retribution. A few months later, when it emerged that Russian authorities had been quietly getting estimates for the cost to repair the pipelines, the [New York Times described](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/26/world/europe/nordstream-pipeline-explosion-russia.html) the news as “complicating theories about who was behind” the attack. No major American newspaper dug into the earlier threats to the pipelines made by Biden and Undersecretary of State Nuland.  While it was never clear why Russia would seek to destroy its own lucrative pipeline, a more telling rationale for the President’s action came from Secretary of State Blinken.  Asked at a press conference last September about the consequences of the worsening energy crisis in Western Europe, [Blinken described](https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-canadian-foreign-minister-melanie-joly-at-a-joint-press-availability/) the moment as a potentially good one:  >*“It’s a tremendous opportunity to once and for all remove the dependence on Russian energy and thus to take away from Vladimir Putin the weaponization of energy as a means of advancing his imperial designs. That’s very significant and that offers tremendous strategic opportunity for the years to come, but meanwhile we’re determined to do everything we possibly can to make sure the consequences of all of this are not borne by citizens in our countries or, for that matter, around the world.”*  If true, will this cause dissonance with some of our allies and how will the world at large respond to this?   [How America Took Out The Nord Stream Pipeline (substack.com)](https://seymourhersh.substack.com/p/how-america-took-out-the-nord-stream)    [White House says blog post on Nord Stream explosion 'utterly false' | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/white-house-says-blog-post-nord-stream-explosion-is-utterly-false-2023-02-08/)
Who do you guys think the greatest or most qualified presidential candidate in the History of the United States who lost was? Was he better than his opponent? With all of these different presidential candidates we have had throughout our country's history, I would like to know who you think were great losing candidates. Throughout the history of the United States, we have elected many great and not-so-great presidents. However, there were undoubtedly instances where the wrong candidate won, and the loser was better or more qualified than the election's winner.  **Edit:** I meant to put he/she in the title. I apologize for any confusion this has caused. 
Do you care about corporations' political activity? What about your pro sports teams? More and more Americans say they make brand decisions based on corporations' political activity...but it seems many draw the line for sports corporations.     But neither the owners of the Eagles nor the Chiefs "stick to sports" - live other owners, they're politically active:  [https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/politics/super-supporters-which-political-teams-do-the-eagles-and-chiefs-help-fund/3273405/](https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/politics/super-supporters-which-political-teams-do-the-eagles-and-chiefs-help-fund/3273405/)     Should it sway fans?
With current reshoring efforts making Mexico a potential manufacturing base for America, is it possible to have an incentive program to get Mexican Americans to help bridge our cultural gap by integrating into these new industries? An estimated 36.6 million Hispanics of Mexican origin lived in the United States in 2017, according to a Pew Research Center analysis. If a decent amount of that population moved to Mexico to be involved involved in Mexican manufacturing processes we could build a very tight economic relationship with Mexico that may be more challenging otherwise.   Obviously other Americans could be involved too, but Mexican Americans would be the priority as they are the cultural bridge.
Could Brian Kemp Candidacy for President be Viable? I live in Atlanta and I don't often hear Brian Kemp brought up much as a challenger in 2024. On paper, he seems like he would work. Georgia's economy is actually not doing too bad. We rebounded quickly from COVID. Our tax base is growing due to more people moving in etc etc. He's relatively moderate on the surface. Could he win the nomination if he ran? What are some of the things you think would be used against him by other Republicans?
Discussion on free speech and the responsibility of big media Free speech tends to be a major topic of discussion in the technological age, especially in the United States. The way we communicate has been drastically changed with the implementation of the internet. It seems there is great miscommunication in the way we are discussing the idea of "free speech". In the United States, freedom of speech is explicitly a constitutional right. However, the basis of a constitutional argument simply can not hold merit when discussing social media. Seeing how this is the main way in which humans communicate today, this brings up many issues. It is no secret that "censorship" is something that exists in social media platforms. The problem is, as business/press, it makes perfect sense to censor your content strictly for monetization purposes. This is why throughout the constant criticism of these platforms, they are still widely used by everybody. It seems the only way to fix the censorship problem would be through some legislation. This seems anti-capitalistic, because it is. People of the right are usually the most critical of this problem, but surely they would not advocate for anti-free market legislation, right? This brings up the societal discussion of the responsibility of large corporations. Do they inherently have an obligation for the good of a society? This is a tricky topic; the balance of power of government and large corporations. Any thoughts on logical solutions to this?
State of the Union discussion thread -- Biden delivers SOTU at 9pm est tonight. Tonight is Biden's SOTU speech and the Republican response, and I think we should expect this will be eventful.  Here's a spot to talk about it.  The speech is being livestreamed on multiple platforms.  Here's the CSPAN link.  [https://www.c-span.org/video/?525522-1/2023-state-union-address-republican-response](https://www.c-span.org/video/?525522-1/2023-state-union-address-republican-response)
Statistics of politics  Have you ever thought about why polls usually have such an even distribution? If you look at popular vote for presidential elections in the USA for example, you will notice they sometimes are almost evenly split. Is there a statistical/mathematical interpretation for this phenomenon, similar to the Gaussian distribution that we see every where in nature? Or is this perhaps the inherent reason that politics exist in the first place? What I mean by this is, if politics were NOT distributed this way, say it was more like 70:30, then would politics even need to exist in the first place? Politics realistically only exist for "hot-button" issues where there is wide disagreement. For example, we don't need to hold elections for the legality of murder (although some Libertarians/Anarchists may disagree) because this is something everyone already can agree on. So perhaps the reason for the even split is the inherent reason for the existence of politics in the first place?
How Will AI Affect The Way That Elections And Petitions Are Conducted? Here is a LessWrong (5 mins read) Blog post about this idea:  [African Wild Dogs Vote By Sneezing - Can AI Help Us Do Better](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/x5yTG2tN5s7j8YrBQ/african-wild-dogs-vote-by-sneezing-can-ai-help-us-do-better)  Its motivation is as follows: African wild dogs vote on whether or not to hunt by sneezing. As a social species, they institute a form of democracy. A tally is taken of those voting to hunt, with a vote being signaled by a sneeze. Have humans really transcended such one-dimensional voting mechanisms? In ancient Greece, all members of a community gathered to address important issues. As civilizations grew larger, this became impossible, but the need for in-person debate and deliberation remained. Here is where representative democracy comes into play; an elected official can debate on behalf of their local constituency. As the world's population has grown, this regime has come under strain as the trust and communication that underpin liberal democracy have dwindled. This is the motivator for the idea (Augmented Assembly) outlined in the post: an AI-aided mechanism to transform the voter from a passive participant to an active contributor. 
Will Trump actually win the Republican Primary? I saw a post on the front page here about who could replace Biden in 2024 but let's look on the other side of the aisle.  So we know Trump is running in 2024. But realistically, what are his chances of winning?  Well we have to analyze the possibility of a DeSantis bid because many polls put DeSantis over Trump. According to some polls \[[1](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/01/23/politics-live-updates-biden-documents-debt-ceiling-standoff/11100063002/)\] \[[2](https://www.clubforgrowth.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/CfGAction_2024_Primary_PollSummary_221114.pdf)\] \[[3](https://thehill.com/hilltv/america/3768760-ron-desantis-beats-trump-in-new-primary-poll-trump-approval-dips-after-2024-announcement/)\], DeSantis beats Trump by a fairly wide margin. However, some other polls \[[1](https://harvardharrispoll.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/HHP_Nov2022_KeyResults.pdf)\] \[[2](https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/12/19/cygnal-poll-trump-leads-hypothetical-2024-republican-primary-desantis-gains-since-midterm-election/)\] \[[3](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-desantis-opinion-poll-club-for-growth-2023-02-06/)\] Trump beats DeSantis. Do both of them have equal support? And if so, how will this affect the GOP?  Trump's incumbency may work in his favor and be a massive strength in the GOP primary. So given all the data, I'd say the likelihood of Trump securing the nomination depends on the existence of a DeSantis campaign.
Should these next two years be spent making sure that Tester, Brown, and Manchin can pander to the right as much as possible? Hi all, I know this question probably sounds weird but given that in the last election Montana, Ohio, and West Virginia went +16, +8, and +40 for Trump, should a focus of senate Democrats be to give the democratic senators from those states opportunities to play revolving villain in order to better their chances at reelection?   This is not me saying I don’t want these next two years to be unproductive and nothing to pass. But if letting these three play revolving villain these next couple years means they can get reelected more easily for another six years, is that a strategy worth doing?   This is something I’ve been thinking about for a bit because the 2024 senate map looks pretty brutal. So I’m just trying to imagine ways Dems can minimize losses.  Thank you for any replies!
Ignoring any real-life implementation attempts and the consequences of said attempts, what are your opinions on Communism in theory? Forget about Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, and other Communist leaders. Focusing solely on the theory of Communism, based on the writings of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels.  This is not to defend nor to critique any leaders and/or regimes of Communism. This is a discussion solely on Communism as a political theory, What are your thoughts and opinions? Should it be as controversial as people believe it to be? Can it be implemented successfully in the real world and not result in disaster? Is there a realistic future for Communism?
What will be the next big political ideology in the coming years? Maybe an ideology that up to this point has never had large mainstream appeal for whatever reason, or perhaps an ideology that has long been dormant but is/will be exploding in popularity.  How do you believe things will be shaken up as a result of this ideology spreading and taking hold, both on the public, and on policy?   Will this ideology be a net good on society? Is it better than the current alternatives and how so? Does it have lasting appeal?
PASTEUR Act To those who don't know, new antibiotics tend to be shelved as last resorts to prevent resistance from spreading. This causes developing antibiotics to not be profitable and even companies to go bankrupt. To combat this, Congress introduced a bill called the PASTEUR Act that basically provides subscription-based contracts for developers and manufacturers, rewarding them for the antibiotic's existence rather than its use, so the antibiotic is ready when it's needed.  Below you'll see how the bill has been doing in terms of support from the last Congress's House and Senate and the one before that. Based on this progress (increase in sponsors) and the bipartisan support, it is likely this bill will pass when it's time to vote on it? Let's exclude the president's veto from this discussion.  Not surprisingly, healthcare organizations support this bill. If you don't support this bill, feel free to explain why. If you do support it, call your local House of Representatives and state Senate and tell them about the bill and to prioritize it. Considering its widespread bipartisan support, I doubt many will voice their disagreement with this bill, but I could be wrong.

Where do you draw the line on political discourse vs. fighting words? I'm curious how different people view the overton window.  For you personally, what are examples of political opinions that perhaps fall into the following categories?   1) Something you disagree with, but think is a valid POV   2) Something repulsive or idiotic that should be opposed strongly, but politely.   3) Something unforgivable that can only be extinguished with censorship / force.
If Biden isn’t the 2024 nominee, who realistically could replace him? Given that the vast majority of Democrats want someone else to run, who could it be?   Kamala Harris seems like an obvious pick, but I doubt she has the crossover appeal (for reasons within and outside of her control) to win a general.  People like Pete Buttigieg and Gavin Newsom might be too alienating to people who aren’t partisan Dems.  And local governors, like Gretchen Whitmer or Jared Polis might be waiting for 2028.  Who could feasibly replace Biden and still win?
What do you propose would unify Americans? Considering the state of politics and the numerous sectors of ideologies within our two parties, there’s a large amount of separation in political views. If there were to be an event or factor that reunified, or mostly reunified Americans, what would it be in your opinion?
What should the extent of immunity from prosecution and suit be for persons having major governmental positions? Members of the European Union recently voted to lift the immunity of several members accused of bribery in relation to scandals RE FIFA.   In some countries, certain kinds of officials are legally, often constitutionally, protected from prosecution and arrest (except when caught red handed, and even then usually requires a procedure to release them quickly) and in some cases civil suit, at least not without the waiver of say a certain dedicated court or the permission of the parliament.   The US, Canada, Australia, Britain, among others, have a weaker form of this, but even they legally cannot prosecute a president. In the US it´s because the DOJ can´t prosecute someone who commands it, and in others it is because a head of state cannot be charged, being the source of state power in the first place.  In France, a president can only be prosecuted after their term ends, but all relevant deadlines are suspended until after the end of their term. IE if the statute of limitations would end in 2025, and a person became president in 2020, the statute of limitations is extended by five years.   Some countries have reformed elements of this process though. And it does not stop a member from being expelled in the regular way, as American legislators can be tossed by a two thirds vote, from being impeached and removed as in Germany, or from simply not being reelected as in Botswana.  What kind of immunity could reasonably be granted to officials of this nature?
What should the future of the Democratic Party look like? Based on the results of the United States 2020 Presidential election and 2022 midterms, it appears that Millennials and Gen Z heavily favor the Democratic Party over the Republican Party. What should the future of the Democratic Party look like, and who should be at the helm in order to maintain high levels of support of what will soon make up a majority of the voting base in the United States?
Should registration requirements for the Selective Service match gender identity? In the United States as males reach adulthood they are required to sign up for the selective service. This for a military draft if needed.  Currently the Biden Administration has decided to continue to discriminate against transgender men and exclude them from this civic duty and won’t let transgender women opt out of this male privilege.  On one end of the spectrum if there was a draft transitioning genders would be a method of draft dodging and would be insulting to legitimate transitioning.  On the other end of the spectrum it is excluding trans men from a right of passage.  Other than canceling the selective service what should be changed?  Should all adults be required to register, should only cis females be exempt, should registration match gender identity, or are there other equatable solutions?  https://www.sss.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/WhoMustRegisterChart.pdf
What criteria would you use to measure the success/efficacy of a government or ruler? If there was a scoring system of sorts that held all rulers and their respective governments accountable, what would it look like and what scores or criteria should be on it?  In other words, how do you judge a government or a ruler? What makes a "good" ruler or government in your book?
What, if anything, should be done with the current practice of "judge shopping" to issue nationwide injunctions against the current administration? Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has filed 26 lawsuits against the Biden administration in the last 2 years seeking nationwide injunctions against various policies his office disagrees with. Over half of them have been filed in single-judge districts where he knows who the judge will be and files there knowing how they'll rule.   This process was made legal in 1988 and has only recently been abused by Republicans in Texas, but could just as easily be used by Democrats against a future Republican president. Should Congress act to pass a law reforming the federal courts and even restricting the ability for a single district judge to make a national ruling?  Here is a free link discussing the practice from the [NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/05/opinion/republicans-judges-biden.html?unlocked_article_code=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACEIPuonUktbfqIhkSlUbBibSRdkhrxqAwuLC2KE2gn71JS6ODDRfw-sYGM2K-kvAY-xje943lXy9deN2DYUOFrZ03_MNeAtkURWpqZ-J35hbfClr-YvjGzJrj8mIAOFhq3rjYzblbeokz-yy5U7YaWe8XLfNkiF0fHYTqpBkfVut2XUL1_2FRrYzgo8iqK9nUpNqRj4AZj2IvO3qD3h9OtaBbhLe7WomSr0TGGGTzZPHteV2IEgFAknGTXh-_W889NtXXdsWN6r8JBckE9Hsk_kGfP5SSQfdw-uOI0MEgw&smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare)
Should prostitution be legal in the United States? If so, how would you like to see it be implemented?   What limits would there be?   What are some positives that may occur as a result that generally aren't talked about?  When do you think realistically it will be legalized, if ever?
What’s the consensus on Texas turning blue? After 2020 everyone was hyping up Texas turning blue especially after Biden came within 5 percentage points. Now, after 2022 Texas was one of a handle full of areas(including Florida and NY) that was effected by the red wave. When can we expect Texas to turn blue?
Why should or shouldn't Biden capture or shoot down the balloon? Rather than arguments attacking Biden personally, what do you see as the reasoning behind different  approaches to handling the Chinese balloon floating above the US? What are the advantages and disadvantages to each given that somewhere in DC this discussion has already occurred or is ongoing?
Why cant Americans seem to agree on what the 2nd Amendment says and means like they can with other Amendments? "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."  These 27 words in the American Constitution have been a point of constant debate, argument and conversation for almost a century now.   Some argue its a statement for the American people to own and use firearms as deemed fit and others argue the 2nd Amendment grants the right to have a Military.   I've seen and read arguments about how its an outdated amendment and the founding fathers could never have imagined what weaponry would be become in the future but doesnt this apply to all the other amendments written too?   In general whenever other amendments are brought up in conversation people are usually in general agreement in what they say, mean, and cover in a modern sense. But the 2nd amendment doesnt get this luxury and it makes me wonder why this is the case.
Will population migration affect US presidential outcomes? In the last census california and new york lost 1 electoral vote each.  Texas gained 2 electoral votes. Florida gained 1.  In all republicans gained 5 electoral votes from the 2020 census.  Current projections are showing much of the same for the next census with republicans gaining electoral votes.  Do you think this will skew future elections to republican side? What can be done to stop this? Should it be stopped or is this democracy?
How would DeSantis White House differ from the Trump White House? DeSantis and Trump are obviously the two frontrunners for the 2024 GOP nomination. Assuming DeSantis wins the nomination and the presidency, how would his presidency be different from Donald Trump's?  Policy-wise, the two appear quite similar, if not identical. Comparing the two's stances on OnTheIssues, the two agree on pretty much every issue from abortion, the economy, immigration, cultural issues, crime, etc. Are there policy issues that the two truly disagree upon? The only difference I can think of is that DeSantis has supported some efforts towards green energy in Florida. Additionally, not much is known about DeSantis' views on foreign affairs and geopolitics.   Stylistically, the two may be perceived to be somewhat different. Would DeSantis be more willing to work with establishment Republicans? Is he more of a globalist who would work with American allies? Would he be more "civil" in his rhetoric?
Why does it seem like Islamic terrorism is just…..not really a problem anymore  Maybe I’m misremembering things, but back in 2015-2017 or so, it seemed like everyone thought that  jihadism/Islamic terrorism was basically the number one threat to world peace and security. Devastating terrorist attacks in the West(San Bernardino, Orlando, Nice), crazy shit happening in Syria, 24/7 arguments about Islam and refugees in the media……then over time it’s like…no one gave a shit about any of this anymore? Is there something I’m missing, or was ISIS really just weakened that heavily?
Stock buybacks were legalized in the US in 1982. With 40 years of history, are they worth keeping around? Should they be regulated more or less? >Buybacks were illegal throughout most of the 20th century because they were considered a form of stock market manipulation. But in 1982, the Securities and Exchange Commission passed rule 10b-18, which created a legal process for buybacks and opened the floodgates for companies to start repurchasing their stock en masse.  [Vox 2018](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/3/22/17144870/stock-buybacks-republican-tax-cuts)  Stock buybacks are when a company purchases their own shares from the market. This reduces the number of shares in the marketplace and pushes up the earning per share metric, a key data point when evaluating a company's financial position.  William Lazonick, president of the Academic-Industry Research Network and professor of economics emeritus at the University of Massachusetts Lowell, argued that in comparison to nowadays, pre-stock buybacks companies more heavily invested in their workers which in turn saw a strengthening of the middle class. Since legalizing stock buybacks, firms have more heavily spent their extra cash in paying dividends and repurchasing stock [HBR 2014](https://hbr.org/2014/09/profits-without-prosperity)  Alex Edmans is a Professor of Finance at London Business School, where he specializes in corporate finance, wrote in 2017 that corporate buybacks are often mischaracterized but make attention grabbing headlines. He reports that large-scale evidence fails to make a case against stock buybacks, instead citing a survey of financial executives concluded that “repurchases are made out of the residual cash flow after investment spending.” [HBR 2017](https://hbr.org/2017/09/the-case-for-stock-buybacks)  [Recently, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 placed a 1% tax on stock buybacks.](https://us.eversheds-sutherland.com/NewsCommentary/Legal-Alerts/253133/Inflation-Reduction-Act-imposes-a-nondeductible-1-excise-tax-on-certain-corporate-stock-buybacks)  How do you evaluate the merits or costs of stock buybacks? Are they worth keeping around? Should they be regulated or outlawed again?
To what degree is overthrowing the American government part of the whole idea of America. The right to bear arms is partly about defending against the tyranny of the US government, if I'm not mistaken.  So, to what extent is this still accepted or has always been accepted?  The government is supposed to be a powerful force, and defend itself even against citizens, but where is the line?
Which states would you pick to go first in the Democratic primary? Right now, the Democratic party is in the [midst of reordering their primaries](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/would-putting-south-carolina-first-give-black-democrats-a-stronger-voice/). Originally, the first four states were always:   * Iowa * New Hampshire * Nevada * South Carolina.   Now it looks like the first states will instead be:  * South Carolina * New Hampshire * Nevada * Georgia * Michigan.  **If you were in charge of the Democratic Party and could pick the first 4-5 states in the primary, which would you choose and why?** (Let's assume that major overhauls of the primary system —say, doing several Super Tuesday-esque primary days—are off the table and you have to work with the state-by-state early part of the primary that we have now.)
What are the accepted rules of spying between nations? Ike and Russia agreed to high altitude surveillance which ended up benefiting the US more than Russia This is in light of today's announcement is the Chinese balloon that seemed to have malfunctioned. I'm assuming the US either made agreements with China allowing this in return for their doing the same, or some tacit acceptance among states to survey foreign countries is in play. If this was a surprise we would hear much more belligerence than curiosity from state.
What if the Trumpist faction of the Republican Party separates in the future? With all the squabbling in the GOP right now, it makes me wonder if at some point the far-right wing of the Republican Party will end up splitting away from them entirely and possibly form their own party. Even their own voter base seems to share these thoughts, with a sizable [28% of "Always Trumpers" willing to go third party.](https://morningshots.thebulwark.com/p/bulwark-poll-28-percent-of-always) If a split like this does happen, what could be the thing that causes it and what would be the effects both short and long term?
Why does UNWRA exist, and why do Palestinian inherit their refuge status? For those of you who don't know, UNWRA is a refuge committee by the UN that focuses only on Palestinian refuges, and their descendants   I recently saw this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU53Bw7fbFE), talking about UNWRA (it has English captions)  According to the video and  a quick google search to confirm the facts -  ||UNWRA|UNCHR| |:-|:-|:-| |Amount of employees|[30.000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNRWA)|[18.800](https://www.unhcr.org/meet-unhcr-staff.html#:~:text=Profiles%20of%20our%20staff%20around,based%20at%20our%20Geneva%20headquarters)| |Amount of refuges|[5.6m](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_refugees)|[103m](https://www.unhcr.org/refugee-statistics/)| |Inheritance of refuge status|[Children born in diaspora inherit the status](https://www.unrwa.org/who-we-are/frequently-asked-questions)|[I tried to search for an answer, but all results direct me towards UNWRA and Palestinians, so my is that the video is correct and other refuges don't inherit the status](https://www.google.com/search?q=do+refuges+inherit+refuge+status&rlz=1C1GCEA_enIL992IL992&oq=do+refuges+inherit+refuge+status&aqs=chrome.0.69i59.46553j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)|  So the questions are why do Palestinians get a special treatment by having a dedicated refuge agency  and inheriting refuge status, and why is UNWRA so oversized when compared to the amount o refuges they take care of?
The federal minimum wage has not risen in over 13 years, the longest time passed since the minimum wage has last risen. What is different about our political climate nowadays that prevents it from rising? [A source to begin the topic for reference.](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/minimum-wage/history/chart)  We are almost reaching 14 years without a federal minimum wage increase, which is the longest amount of time in our history since the last raise. Notable gaps in the past include:  Jan 1, 1981 - Apr 1, 1990 ~ 9 years  Sep 1, 1997 - Jul 24, 2007 ~ 9 years   Otherwise, the rest of the history has raises occurring between 1-6 year time-spans. What is notable about these other two gaps mentioned is that they are decently modern.  Are there any political reasons as to why gaps in the minimum wage increases are notably becoming larger and larger nowadays?
What do you think is the reason for this trend in Somaliland? I have recently been trying to analyze the political space in Republic of Somaliland and comparing the voter turn out of the previous two  elections ie. 2017 presidential and 2021 Parliamentary, this is the trend that I have found.   1. Kulmiye has experienced an overall decrease of votes by 18.18%  2. Waddani has experienced an overall decrease of votes by 3.50% 3. UCDI has experienced an overall increase of votes by 21.68%  Could we have a discussion on this?
Why are positions on whether gender affirming surgery should be legal and for who so inconsistent? The topic of gender affirming care and surgery keeps coming up over and over, and something I cannot help noticing is the stark inconsistency of positions presented by many who are speaking out on the topic, and this inconsistency frequently shows up even in legislation.  Bills banning surgery for transgender minors will carve out exceptions for cisgender minors and for nonconsenting DSD babies. Why should it be illegal for a transgender 17-year-old who identifies as male to get their breasts removed, but legal for a cisgender 17-year-old who identifies as female to get breast augmentation? Are those not both forms of gender affirming surgery performed on minors? Why include carve-outs perming infants with ambiguous genitalia to be surgically operated on when banning such procedures for teens old enough to advocate their own position on the topic?  Is this simple hypocrisy on the past of hyperpartisan politicians, or is there an actual reason that these carve-outs and exceptions should exist, and if so, why is that missing more or less entirely from the public debate?  Reminder: Dwayne Johnson has had gender affirming surgery performed on his chest. I would appreciate if everyone discussing the topic could keep in mind the wide range of how these treatments are used, that such treatments are *all* elective too carrying degrees, and that access to such treatments is potentially a mental health issue for everyone regardless of gender identity.
How likely is it for Sweden and Finland to join NATO? As of now, all NATO members except for Hungary and Turkey have approved the bid of Sweden and Finland ([source 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland%E2%80%93NATO_relations?wprov=sfti1), [source 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden%E2%80%93NATO_relations?wprov=sfti1)), while Hungary and Turkey both seem to be unwilling to accept.  Is it likely for Sweden and Finland to win Turkey and Hungary’s support? If so, how?
Where did all the centrists go? I haven't met a centrist since 2019. It seems like ever since 2020, centrists have all disappeared from the Earth, or rather, they all went off into 'this corner' or 'that corner'. The people who were centrists from before are now either full-on progressives or conservatives.  2020 (with all of its baggage like the chaotic election drama, BLM uprising, COVID, etc) was like a Hurricane that just pushed everyone further left or further right. Most of them went further left. Like TJ Kirk - who has always leaned left. Now he's so far-left it's unrecognizable. I had friends in real life who described themselves as being 'in the center' or simply 'libertarians'. Some of them went conservative and a lot of them went progressive.  Are there any centrists out there? Is there anyone who takes the best things from right AND left ideology, puts it together, and has their own set of ideas?
With the new assault weapons ban in Illinois and counties refusing to enforce it what does this mean in the future? With over 80+ counties refusing to enforce the ban what does this mean for future endeavors. Will we see more of this in other states how will this affect the state. With the increasing political divide and what seemed to be a divide among not only states but counties now do you think that we will start heading towards a more separated America? What are y’all’s thoughts on this.
Realistically, what will Republicans look toward for spending cuts? As we continue to approach the debt ceiling, Dem and GOP leaders are trying to figure out a deal on how to combat the issue. The Democrats insist they want to just raise the ceiling instead of enacting cuts, but House GOP leaders have already said that is a non-starter. Republicans are saying they will only reach a deal on the ceiling if spending cuts are made, but so far have failed to identify what exactly they want to cut. Since Democrats control 2 branches of government, cutting Medicare and Social Security is also a non-starter.  What can the Republicans cut that would also be accepted by Democrats?
Will Barack Obama be viewed more positively over the next few decades? Barack Obama left office with an approval rating around 60%, and the C-SPAN Presidential Historians Survey currently has him ranked as the tenth best President of all time, but how will he be viewed in the next ten, twenty, thirty + years?
How do older folk advocate the government for affordability so well? Older people have not only social security, but things like affordable health care and affordable housing.  In my state of Florida, there is a special housing designation (55+ communities, Federal Register 24 CFR Part 100; section 760.24-760.37 (4a), Florida Statutes) where if at least 80% of the residents are 55+, the government subsidizes housing, to the point where rent for such communities is now 30% of market price.  With rising prices and a failure of worker skill development to adjust to the new market demands, how can younger Americans achieve the same economic comfort level given to the older American population by the government?
Presidential Job Approval by Party According to the Pew Research Center, the partisan gap in presidential job approval rating has steadily increased in recent decades. Trump and Biden are the only two presidents to start at an approval rating of below 10% by the opposing party. For context, Kennedy had an approval rating above 50% by Republicans when he was elected. Nixon had an approval rating of almost 50% by democrats when elected. Why have we seen such a drastic change in recent decades?
What happens if a third unpopular party with no strong political structure wins the presidency ? Title Edit : What happens if a third force party with no political structure wins the presidency?   Africas most populous nation Nigerias election is less than 30 days away .  This election is the most divisional election ever -why ?   Religion & Tribe & Geo-regional zoning   I’ll touch on tribe   There are 3 major tribes in Nigeria .   Hausa - Igbo - Yoruba   The 3 front runners   Atiku a Hausa  Obi an Igbo   Tinubu a Yoruba   3 of them are popular but obi seems to be the one with the major buzz - because he presents himself as the messiah the country so needs to break from the shackles of the political parties the other two candidates are from .   His party, the labor party was  not a household party until this cycle , they have no seats in the House of Representatives and the senate - and the candidates the labor party fields for H.O.R , governorship  and senate are pretty unpopular, the party doesn’t even have some candidates representing the party in some region.   My question now is : let’s assume labor party Peter obi wins - this means he would have  no structure to support him in the H.O.R , governorship & Senate -   How does this affect democracy or the country with over 200 million people at large ?   How important is a politically structure to the security and social-economic growth of a country?  Are there countries whom have gone through this stage?
Georgia Voting Law Input  Like a lot of us on here, when the Georgia Voting Law was announced most of us thought that it was racist law based off of the media, and how the Liberals were describing it, from Biden all the way down. Jim Crow 2.0. I started to buy into it, but was getting a different picture depending on which news article I was reading, so I down loaded the law, and read the 91 pages the new law. Well the results are out in a survey done by the University of Georgia. In the survey of a sampling of 364 blacks in Georgia they found that 73% of them had an excellent experience in voting, followed by 24% rating their experience as good, followed by 3% rating it as fair. 0 people rated there experience as poor. Wondering with the record turn out reported by minorities for the mid-terms, and this pole by the University of Georgia, has anyone changed their mind on if the Georgia Voting law is racist or not?
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act - motivations What national interest considerations motivate the US government to prosecute private US businesses and individuals for paying bribes to foreign government officials to win business abroad? For example to win exploration rights to drill an oil well in Nigeria.   It cannot be just ethical reasons. There must be certain rational considerations that make it in the US public's self interest to punish such behavior, even though it has no direct impact on the US citizens. Can anyone please elaborate (without passing value judgements)?
If immigration continues or increases from the Middle East and Northern Africa to Europe, could we eventually see genocide return if the population reaches a critical point? The far-right is returning in popularity to Europe as it seizes upon the opportunity for ethnonationalim to return in light of recent trends in immigration. Would there be a critical point at which genocide could return to places or a country as a whole (for example, 40% Islamic)? If so, how would it be carried out? What would be the rest of the world’s reaction? Could this eventually lead to WWIII?
What incentive is there to speak honestly when lies and misinformation are accepted at face value at all levels of politics? Serious question, not naming names (or lies), but it seems to me that individuals in multiple levels of government are able to say whatever they want, without any repercussion, regardless of the validity (or factual quantifiability) of their claims. So what is the incentive to speak honestly at all?
Why don't the most Democratic blue states in the USA implement universal healthcare systems? Hello, I am not American, but I started wondering this and can't find a clear answer. Some states are overwhelming controlled by Democrats with supermajorities in legislature and Democrat governors. (Maryland, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Oregon, California) just to put some suggestions on the board.  Also, many of the countries that have universal healthcare are actually run by the individuals states (or those countries' equivalents of states). Germany, Austria, Canada for example. Canada has 77% of each Provinces' healthcare funding from the Province's budget, not federal.  US states have greater autonomy compared to the central government compared with in many of those other countries. Certainly money from the federal government would eventually need to come in, but the federal government already helps subside significant amounts of private healthcare, the state systems could help fill in the gaps.  I understand Democrats want a federal public option, but the insane scope and size of the US makes me think the only way it could ever work in the USA is state side. (Which is already not uncommon in the Universal healthcare world). I never hear state governors making this campaign province or attempting to pass it, only national leaders only for it to never even be attempted once they reach government.  So what are your thoughts on this, help me understand this, I am open to any and all opinions/views on this from any perspective.
Does the US have too many law enforcement agencies? The US has approximately 337 million people and 18,000 different law enforcement agencies. This works out to be around 53.4 agencies per million people.  For comparison, Australia has 8 agencies and 27 million people. This is works out to be around 0.3 agencies per million people.   I was wondering if anyone knows why we have so many and if this could be a cause of some of the issues facing policing in the US like training, budgets, oversight etc.?  Source: I got the agency numbers off Wikipedia, I acknowledge this isn’t the best source but still useful enough to make my point and ask my question.
What impact, if any, will ChatGPT and other rapidly developing AI software's have on our political systems and political stability? So, with the release of ChatGPT in the past few weeks, it has rose immediate and serious concerns over the impact of more sophisticated AI systems will have as they become more prominent in everyday life. More specifically, such AI systems are feared to represent a direct automation threat to many jobs and industries, which will ultimately have consequences on our society and politics.  I am making this post to ask the following key questions:  1. ) What impact, if any, will AI have on society?  2.) Now that such AI systems have arrived and are currently developing rapidly, how should governments respond to this new presence in society?
RAND's analysis focuses primarily on U.S. role to end the war in Ukraine based on what is primarily in the interest of the United States and not Ukranian territorial integrity. RAND seeks avoidance of a long war. Under what conditions, if any, can Ukraine find such a negotiated solution palatable?  The debate in Washington and other Western capitals over the future of the Russia-Ukraine war privileges the issue of territorial control.  RAND's analysis suggests territorial debate is too narrowly focused on one dimension of the war’s trajectory. Territorial control, although immensely important to Ukraine, is not the most important dimension of the war’s future for the United States.  RAND concludes that, in addition to averting possible escalation to a Russia-NATO war or Russian nuclear use, avoiding a long war is also a higher priority for the United States than facilitating significantly more Ukrainian territorial control.  Furthermore, RAND acknowledges that the U.S. ability to micromanage where the line is ultimately drawn is highly constrained since the U.S. military is not directly involved in the fighting. Enabling Ukraine’s territorial control is also far from the only instrument available to the United States to affect the trajectory of the war. RAND highlighted several other tools—potentially more potent ones—that Washington can use to steer the war toward a trajectory that better promotes U.S. interests. Whereas the United States cannot determine the territorial outcome of the war directly, it will have direct control over these policies.  The alternative, RAND asserts, is a long war that poses major challenges for the United States, Ukraine, and the rest of the world.  Under what conditions, if any, can Ukraine find such a negotiated solution palatable?  The 30-page Rand analysis: Avoiding a Long War is available in Pdf link below and can be downloaded for free:  [Avoiding a Long War: U.S. Policy and the Trajectory of the Russia-Ukraine Conflict | RAND](https://www.rand.org/pubs/perspectives/PEA2510-1.html)
Where will President Joe Biden rank historically as president? Though its premature and we don't know what can happen in the following 2 years. As we past on 2 years of a Biden presidency,  where do you think Joe Biden will rank historically as a president or where is he on track to be ranked considering what his administration has accomplished and failed in the last 2 years.
Why did the Chinese government implement the "three red lines" policy the way it did? TLDR: Why did China nuke its own (probably inflated) real estate market?  As many of you will know, the Chinese real-estate market has been in crisis for almost a year now. China Evergrande, one of the largest builders in China, defaulted in Dec 2022, despite multiple attempts at intervention throughout 2021.  As a quick overview, the Chinese property market has been insane over the past decade+. China invests [20-30%](https://carnegieendowment.org/chinafinancialmarkets/87751) of GDP in property and infrastructure. Unfortunately, China also stores [70%](https://fortune.com/2021/12/02/chinese-real-estate-investing-home-ownership-evergrande/) of wealth in real estate for a variety of reasons. This has led to a housing bubble of mammoth proportions. In Shenzhen, for example, housing is priced at [700x](https://www.ft.com/content/f737dd05-26ed-452f-8acf-b16139fcea3d) monthly rent. Shenzhen apartments are [20%](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=China&city1=Shenzhen&country2=United+States&city2=New+York%2C+NY) more expensive than NYC, and if you don't understand how insane that is, consider that NYC cost of living is otherwise \~3x that in Shenzhen, and indeed *renting* an apartment in the city center of New York is 393.9% more expensive than in Shenzhen.  Such pricing has funded a boom in real estate, where developers regularly charge customers for apartments which are in the process of being built. Recently, due to a slowdown in migration to cities, companies like Evergrande have also taken on additional debt in order to build their presold apartments.  Which gets to the root of the matter. The situation looked bad, and super fragile. I completely understand why policymakers would want to fix the situation. What I don't understand is the extremely blunt "three red lines" policy:  1. Liabilities not to exceed 70% of assets 2. Net debt not greater than 100% of equity 3. Money reserves 100% of short term debt  This policy led to the near immediate collapse of Evergrande, with wider contagion effects which are not totally clear, but also probably not good. Home buyers have started to refuse to pay their mortgages, other real estate developers are in danger of default, etc. China refused to publish economic figures (GDP, etc.) for the first time a few months ago, which probably means they aren't good. I think it's safe to say that things are going significantly worse than the CCP thought they would.  This leads to my main question: Why? Did the CCP not understand how leveraged companies like Evergrande were (despite being closely intertwined with the real estate industry)? Did the CCP not understand that real estate companies are highly interconnected with Chinese GDP? Did the CCP overestimate the resilience of the Chinese economy? What was the CCP envisioning the effects of the policy would be?
Have we tipped the scales towards self destruction more then ever even at the height of Cuban missile crisis? With the agreement of nato to send tanks to Ukraine, how close are we coming to nuclear fallout? Obviously we all want to think this is far fetched for the Putin, but it seems tensions are about to get real serious after this decision by the west. Everything is ramping up not slowing down?   Are we now at the highest level on conflict with the Russians ever in human history with the most destructive weapons invented or was the 60’s more frightening?
Would you vote for a party without leader, where every major decision is voted on by thousands of people of similar political opinions? Do you think that there could exist a party that is independent of the personalities of its leader and other members? Party where transparent voting of the large mass of people decides all major decisions and representants in parliament are just experts obliged to follow these decisions. Or do you know of any that exists? Would you vote for it?
What is the likelihood that the Midwest states of MI, WI and PA will remain swing states in presidential elections for the foreseeable future? Whilst no means certain, it seems that the Midwestern states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania will be in swing states for many presidential races to come.   The three Midwestern states shifted from lean/safe Democratic states to swing states in 2016. It was unexpected as prior to 2016, Michigan and Pennsylvania voted for every Democratic candidate since 1992. Wisconsin voted for every Democratic candidate since 1988.   It was a shock to most political scientists when Trump won all three in 2016. It was likely down to his appeal to blue collar workers ‘left behind’ by globalisation as he campaigned on ‘bringing back the jobs’. Trump won them by less than 1 percentage point. Biden won them back by only 1 to 2 percentage points.  It doesn’t look like the demographics will significantly shift in the next few presidential elections or maybe longer. This is proved by looking at some of the recent US Senate elections in these states (excluding the 2018 blue wave). Gary Peters (MI) and Ron Johnson (WI) won their Senate race by less 2 percentage points in 2020 and 2022 respectively. Whilst John Fetterman (PA) won by 5 percentage points, it was against an exceptionally weak candidate.  It seems like these three states will likely decide the president for the foreseeable future.
What is stopping a multi (or even uni)lateral invasion of North Korea and Iran due to the tremendous threat their nuclear weapons programs pose? Please hear me out.   I  know China exerts pressure on NK to cease its nuclear program as it is a threat to Chinese security. South Korea and Japan are deeply vulnerable. Iran poses a similar threat to neighboring countries, and especially Israel and the US. They appear to be clear and present dangers, as Saddam's Iraq was purported to be (hence the justified post-911 invasion).  These areas are major problems due to their ideological extremist views they also prop up their authoritarian governments.  I can understand that the world is hesitant to invade another country, but those countries can destroy the world. A world in which countries with such rigid and violent ideologies possess nuclear weapons is terrifying.  On the realpolitik side what are the limitations we are facing that prevent a decisive end to these countries' dalliances with nuclear weapons? And also as important, are current policies actually effective in stopping these programs?
1 out the last 5 presidents was born outside the 1940s. So the US has been lead by the same generation for 23 years. Time for a younger president?? Clinton, Bush Jr, Trump and Biden were all born in the 1940s. (Obama was 1961).  These four are from the same generation and so will have a similar mindset on certain things. (Obviously Republicans and Democrats will differ in a lot of ways but there will still be some beliefs or ideas from that generation that they will share - Even if it is that everyone younger than them is just lazy and plays that hippy music too damn loud). They will approach issues from the same start point. Yes they will come to different conclusions but wouldn’t it be refreshing to have a president approach issues in a totally new way. Something good may come of it. Whoever the president is after Biden (Assuming he wins a second term) will likely be someone younger. Do you think it is time for someone a lot younger or should we stick with the Old Guard? Does Bernie still have it in him? Or is someone similar to AOCs age a better option. (Not necessarily AOC but someone of that generation. I think they will be old enough by then. I may be wrong) This is just a thought I had in the hope it would start a friendly discussion on the age of the president.
U.S. Federal Cannabis Legalization Over the last decade over 20 states have legalized recreational cannabis sales and many other states are at least taking cursory steps toward recreational cannabis. However, Congress has been unable to move even minor legalization related bills such as the SAFE banking act. At what point will Congress have to begin working on federal cannabis legislation? Or will it remain federally illegal while legal in over half the country?  Do you think it will be small steps starting with reforming banking and taxes on cannabis sales and businesses or just become a wave directly to federal rescheduling or legalization?
On balance, has the power of the American Supreme Court to strike Acts of Congress down for lack of constitutionality improved the United States or not? It has vetoed some things that Congress has done which many might think they should have, such as certain equality of pensions in the 1970s, but it also has struck down ideas that could have been radical like the 1883 Civil Rights Cases which made laws regarding non governmental discrimination hard if not impossible to enforce.   Note I am not referring to state laws being struck down, just acts of Congress to which the Supreme Court is equal to.  Edit: This is about the actual experience of judicial review over federal laws, not its potential for use or the rationale or the exploitation in particular cases. Is it a net positive? Net negative? Neutral?
Outrage fatigue So as not to polarize this topic, I’ve seen amongst my friend groups that one side of the political spectrum seems to be much less susceptible to outrage fatigue, while the other is deep in it. Have you seen a difference in outrage fatigue from one side over the other? And why does one side seem more capable of extended, countless outrage, while the other gets easily exhausted by political outrage? Is it something in the ideology, or in how it is presented? Curious if others have seen this same thing.
What are the long-term repercussions of states charging women crimes for getting an abortion in a state where it's legal? What happens to the woman in the state where it legal? The sum of the question has to do with the growing pressure from right-wing groups to expand abortion bans until they can make it as restrictive as possible.   One of the suggestions is that women can be charged with a crime for having an abortion even if it's in a state where it is legal.   What happens if the woman refuses to return to the state where she is charged with a crime? My guess is that some legal battle happens that goes up to the Supreme Court.   What are the chances that the Supreme Court strikes this down as unconstitutional? If they don't and argue that states must return the women, what happens? What if the states no longer comply?   Effectively I'm trying to suss out a lot of what if scenarios based on things being post-Roe.
When the democrats had majority in Congress, why didn’t they pass stricter gun laws? Generally democrats want tighter gun regulation. I’m trying to understand the party scenarios that would need to play out to have stricter gun laws (I.e no assault rifles). I understand that if reps control the house and dem senate or vice Versa it hard to pass a law, but how come it’s still difficult when the same party has majority of both?
Can a non-Trump Republican presidential candidate win the 2024 election focusing on culture wars? It seems that potential GOP presidential candidates are focusing heavily on culture wars rather than 'bread and butter issues' such as the economy and jobs. Governor Ron DeSantis has signed which mainly involve prohibiting certain topics and books in schools. These topics include issues related to race and sexuality. He has signed laws on limiting abortion. Whilst these issues are favoured by the GOP base, it doesn't appeal to swing voters in battleground states. Issues based on the economy are the deciding factors in a presidential election.  In 2016, one factor in Trump's success was his appeal to blue-collar workers in rust-belt states of MI, OH, WI and PA. They felt left behind by globalisation as industrial jobs had moved abroad. They believed that Trump would be able to bring the industrial jobs back. These voters swung the election towards Trump.  It seems that potential GOP candidates are too focused on culture wars instead of economic issues which are more important to swing voters. However, it might also be tactic to win the GOP primary and then focus on economic issues in the general election.
Are there any countries where people are actually satisfied with their politicians? I have the impression that politicians have a bad reputation everywhere. It is being said that they are corrupt, power-hungry, incompetent, criminal and so on.   But are there exceptions? Are there countries where politicians are being viewed positively?
Is it good for constituents when politicians engage in pure politics? I'm not talking about writing quality legislation that represents interests.  I'm talking about rule changing, deal making, tradition braking, etc. Ignoring the meaning of words and promises to get whatever thing done.  Like changing the rules of electing judges, changing filibuster rules, etc.  Is it good for the constituents when politicians do what ever necessary to get something done in congress?
Trump 2024? After the stigma around Trumps presidency and the backlash he’s received, but also with the amount of die hard supporters he has accumulated, is there really a realistic chance he may win the 2024 presidential election as he’s planning on running again?
What is the likelihood that Biden nominates an Asian American to the Supreme Court if a vacancy arises? Minorities have been nominated onto the Supreme Court. These include the first African American - Marshall. The first women - O’Connor. The first Hispanic - Sotomayor. The first Jewish person - Kagan. The first African American woman - Jackson. However, an Asian American has yet to be nominated.  Asian Americans are hugely underrepresented in the federal judiciary. There are only 48 Asian Americans federal judges out of 871 federal judges (5.5%) which is just under the % of Asian Americans in the country. Biden has appointed a significant Asian American judges onto district and appellate courts.   An Asian American Supreme Court justice may also improve Asian American political participation, this demographic seems the least engaged in politics. This is likely due to the lack of representation at all levels of the federal government. If there is more representation then Asian American will be able to help dictate policies beneficial to them.  Biden has already nominated the first black woman to the court, he could nominate the first Asian American. The difficulties could be that the pool of candidates could be limited. This is entirely dependent on a vacancy arising at all in his term which seems unlikely. Although, this could be equally applied to a future president.
Us Military budget I’ve finally done enough research to formulate a surface level opinion on military spending. Although, I want to hear some more perspectives to learn more.   Below are some questions:  - How do we achieve a responsible budget, without losing too much capability to strike/defend around the world?  - Where would the freed up capital be deployed instead?  - Possibility of adversarial/rogue states pouncing on the opportunity to engage in more aggressive behavior?   I look forward to learning from the comments!
It is conceivable that the Democrats will consistently win the presidency in the near future? With the Republican Party shifting to the right, it seems unlikely that a moderate Republican can be nominated as the presidential nominee. More right wing candidates will win the primary. In the 2022 midterms, we saw that the more right wing candidates lost in battleground states. If this is reflected in a presidential race, that it is very difficult for a right wing  GOP nominee to win in key states. The candidate must be able to win over conservatives and moderates.  From history, we can see that this matters. From 1968 to 1992, the Democrats controlled the president for 4 out of 24 years. The 1976 win was extremely lucky due to the Watergate scandal and Ford pardoning Nixon. Carter barely managed to beat Ford. 1972, 1980, 1984 and 1988 were Republican landslides. The candidates such as George McGovern was too far to the left for the American public. Mondale and Dukakis were fairly liberal as well. Carter lost due to his mismanagement of the economy and the Iranian hostage crisis. It was only until the Democrats embraced centrism then they had a chance of winning. Bill Clinton was a moderate.  It seems that unless the GOP nominate a moderate then swing voters will vote for the Democratic candidate. The only way a right wing candidate can win is if the Democrats nominate a far left candidate or if the Democrats mismanage the economy.  Trump’s win in 2016 was an aberration. He was unknown at the time and rode on a populist wave. Moderates in swing states disliked Clinton and were willing to give Trump a chance. The moderates turned against him in the 2018, 2020 and 2022 elections as they were disdained at his behaviour.  This won’t stop the GOP from winning the House or Senate but could affect their chance of winning the presidency.
From Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps is a terrorist organization To we must hope for a deal with Iran, which one is the right path for the European Union? As European Parliament voted on recognizing Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization (This vote has no enforcing power) Josep Borrell who is in charge of Foreign Affairs and Security Policy in EU hints on keeping avenues of talk open which would be impossible if IRGC which is an integral part of Islamic Revolution is recognized as a terrorist organization.  By what decision Europe Union can get the best of Iran's turbulent situation?
Nikki Haley is hinting at running for President. If she got the nomination How would this change the dynamics of a presidential race? As a former governor and ambassador to the UN, she is probably one of the most qualified females of color that would potentially run for the presidency on the GOP side. If she was to win the nomination, would the talking points for each party become different?    I would assume that she would tone down the rhetoric around immigration due to the fact that her parents are immigrants.  She would also avoid any tendency to do dog whistles around racism since she is also a person of color.  On the Democratic side, would it be more difficult to paint her as someone who dislikes, immigration and supports white supremacy like has fern done with DeSantis and Trump?   I think that there may be more of a dialogue of policy versus the back-and-forth on some of the dog whistling happening from both sides on issues of racial injustice, immigration, etc.  Obviously, it depends on who the Democratic candidate was… and the dynamic would change dramatically if it was two females, running for office versus one female, and one male
How will the American public and politicians react to graphic drone footage of American soldiers crying/dying/panicking in future armed conflicts? With the increase in drone warfare in Ukraine, we are seeing a lot of graphic war footage that has really never been seen before. This reminds me of the days of Vietnam when raw color footage was shown on TV. Americans reacted very poorly to seeing this kind of stuff. Vietnam soldiers were seen in a different light and treated differently after the war.  The culture in modern American really glorifies the American soldier as the elite of the elite. How will politicians react to graphic drone footage of American soldiers dying, crying, panicking, committing suicide, and doing all the tragic things that really happen in war? How will the American people react?
Suppose Trump's 2024 campaign fizzles out, and DeSantis never announces a presidential run at all. Who is the next logical Republican candidate? With Donald Trump's 2024 campaign being fuelled by nothing but indignant rage over his 2020 loss, it's becoming clear that a significant portion of the Republican party is preparing to turn to a different leader. Ron DeSantis has been touted as one possible successor to Trump, but has not yet made any official moves towards a presidential run. If Trump's once-iron grip over the party continues to wane, and DeSantis decides to wait it out until 2028 when he doesn't have to face an incumbent president, which GOP figure is the most likely to be the presidential nominee in 2024?
Will presidential impeachments become much more common in the future? Due to rise of political partisanship, it appears the impeachment of a president will happen frequently in the near future. Obviously, a conviction in the Senate is unlikely due to a 2/3rds majority required but a simple majority is required in the House.  The political rhetoric of impeachment has changed since the election of Trump.   Democrats such as Rep. Al Green (TX) called for Trump’s impeachment in May 2017, just 4 months after he took office.  Republicans such as Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (GA) called for Biden’s impeachment days after he took office in January 2021.  The constitution is extremely vague on the grounds for impeachment, it only says high crimes and misdemeanours. This leaves it to a partisan House of Representatives to decide what constitutes as high crimes and misdemeanours.  From 1787 to 2019, only 2 impeachments occurred in 232 years. (Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton)  Richard Nixon would have been impeached but resigned before the House could vote on impeachment.  There were times where the president did something questionable but weren’t impeached. One example is Ronald Reagan and the Iran-Contra scandal. Democrats controlled the House but never considered impeachment.   From 2019 to 2021, 2 impeachments occurred in 2 years (Donald Trump x2)  House Republicans have been very vocal about investigating and impeaching Biden in this congress.   The rise in partisanship means that in the future a president will be very likely impeached if the House of Representatives is controlled by the opposite party. It seems that impeachment is likely to be used as a tool for political grandstanding and to weaken the president especially if they are seeking re-election. The bar for impeachment has lowered since Trump was first impeached in 2019.
Is American politics really worse than other western countries? People on social media complain a lot about American politics but there also seems to be political turmoil in other countries. The UK had their whole prime minister and Liz Truss fiasco last year, Canadian politicians seem to all be disliked, and even New Zealand's prime minister suddenly resigned. America's economy is still largely better than most countries as well. Is the problem with American politics exaggerated and if it's not, what makes it worse than other western countries?
Should raising the debt limit be tied to passing the budget? It feels like once every few years, and far more frequently now, there are problems with increasing the debt limit. It seems irresponsible to pass a spending budget without any guarantee that we will pay for it. Wouldn't it be far better to pass a budget and raise the debt limit to where it needs to be in one vote? As it is now, the budget and debt limit increase aren't even voted on by the same congress.  Is there some reason these two things have to be done not just separately but also so far apart? Is it just a political trick to split allocating money from actually paying the bill? Do other countries have the same process? If so, do they have the same problem or do they have a solution?
What is the likelihood of a Republican Supreme Court appointee shifting to the liberal wing of the court? Every GOP Supreme Court appointee since Clarence Thomas has remained firmly on the conservative wing of the court on most of the major decisions. John Roberts has sided with the liberal wing on some decisions but he is not a guaranteed liberal vote on the court.   Therefore, all 6 GOP SCOTUS appointees since Thomas have been safely conservative. This was not necessarily the case before the nomination of Thomas. For example:  Richard Nixon nominated Harry Blackmun.  Gerald Ford nominated John Paul Stevens.  George H.W. Bush nominated David Souter.   These were on the liberal wing of the court when they retired.  Also, Reagan nominated Sandra Day O’Connor and Anthony Kennedy. They weren’t on the liberal wing but were willing to side with them on some contentious issues.  It seems that this is now a rarity and that GOP SCOTUS nominees will be safely conservative. It is believed that the foundation of the Federalist Society means that every GOP SCOTUS nominee has to be vetted by the society to ensure they are firmly conservative. Partisanship is another factor as nominees are confirmed on a party line basis hence justices will consider decisions to benefit the party that confirmed them.  This likely means that it is unlikely a GOP SCOTUS nominee will shift to the liberal wing of the court as their conservative credentials will likely decide whether they will be confirmed.
Are Muslims no longer the target of right-wing hatred in America? Are Muslims no longer the target of right-wing hatred in America?  So if you rewind 10 years back, the biggest talking point among the right-wing circles was how Muslims were the number one enemy of the United States, how "Shariah Law" was going to be implemented in America, Muslim immigrants were seen as a big problem, people like Robert Spencer and Pamela Geller were prominent. The so-called "Ground Zero Mosque" was a big dividing point among Americans. This hatred against Muslims really entered popular consciousness around 9/11 and then peaked around 2012 plateauing into the rise of Trump and the War against ISIS.   But today, it seems that Muslims are no longer a talking point among the right-wing Americans. Instead their attention has turned against "Liberals" as a whole, against things like critical race theory, transgender controversies, gender ideologies, LGBT stuff. The right-wing echo chambers and talking heads focus entirely on how evil Biden and the Democrats are. There is continued hatred of Muslims but it gets subsumed into a wider hatred and disdain of immigrants as a whole I've noticed.   This is probably attributed to a few things. The rapid and easy defeat of ISIS probably showed most Americans that radical Islam could never pose a threat to the United States. The New Zealand Mosque Shootings probably made some people realize they've gone too far with their talking points. And the political polarization in America reached such extreme levels that the right-wing stopped caring about Muslims. COVID may have also played a role where it was a massive global event that took attention away from 20 years of news focusing on radical Islamic terrorists, and the right-wing focused their attention on fighting mask and vaccine mandates instead. Plus America no longer being involved in Iraq or Afghanistan and the news cycle eager to move on from those topics.   Do you feel this is correct, and are Muslims sort of "in the clear" or will the spotlight return on them again sometime in the future?
Impeaching a member of the house Given the numerous alleged crimes committed by Rep George Santos, how likely do you think it would be that the house would votes 2/3 to impeach and remove him if it came to a vote?  When DJT was impeached practically all Rs voted no due to their political careers and futures being tied to the then president  I believe only the speaker can call a vote. Also all the Ds would vote yes. But would enough Rs be willing to expel a member of their own party?
What is the japanese solution for population decline? Japan belongs to the Western world and suffers from a severe case of population ageing.  There is a universal solution to this problem in the West: open the borders and allow an influx of young immigrant workforce.  Why doesn't Japan do this? How do they solve the ageing problem?
Gov. Kathy Hochul is preparing to sue Senate Democrats over her Court of Appeals nomination Hector LaSalle - Is there legal standing to bypass the judiciary committee to go straight to a floor vote? And does this also signal a return to Cuomo-style politics? A few weeks ago, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul nominated Hector LaSalle to the state's highest court, the Court of Appeals, replacing Chief Justice Janet DiFiore. Up until now, Hochul has been a fairly lowkey governor who usually would work with the legislature to pass their agenda.  However, the NY State Senate is not too pleased with Hochul's pick. Democrats, who have a supermajoirty in the chamber, are opposed to LaSalle's nomination, citing LaSalle's [anti-union and anti-abortion rulings](https://www.commondreams.org/news/hector-lasalle). Hochul has argued these rulings only tell one part of a story and should not impact the impartialness of LaSalle.  As per NY Senate rules, any judiciary nominee must first pass through the judiciary committee, and it is heavily implied LaSalle will not survive a committee vote, therefore denying him a full floor vote.  In response, [Hochul's office retained a litigator, ex-state solicitor general Caitlin Halligan, for a likely legal battle with Senate Democrats over Hector LaSalle's nomination. At issue: whether nominee can be voted down in the Judiciary Committee or requires a full chamber vote](https://twitter.com/ChrisBragg1/status/1615500689643388929?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet), effectively bypassing the judiciary committee where Hochul will seek Republican votes to confirm her nominee since she does not have enough Democratic votes.  My questions are: does this legal strategy have any chance of succeeding? And second, does this signal a return to Cuomo-style politics? Cuomo was incredibly involved with the legislature, to the point of being able to strong-arm a lot of members, which is why the Senate jumped at the chance to impeach Cuomo when his scandals broke. Does this seem like Hochul is trying the same strategy?  EDIT: The New York State Senate Judiciary Committee has voted down LaSalle’s nomination with 2 in favor and 10 opposed.
Can a presidential candidate get over 400 electoral college votes in the current climate of political polarisation? The increase in political polarisation means that it is unlikely that no presidential candidate, regardless of party, will get 400+ electoral votes.  In the 8 elections since 1988, no candidate has received 400+ electoral votes.  1992: Clinton: 370 Bush Sr: 168 1996: Clinton: 379 Dole: 159 2000: Bush Jr: 271 Gore: 267 2004: Bush Jr: 286 Kerry: 252 2008: Obama: 365 McCain: 173 2012: Obama: 332 Romney: 206 2016: Trump: 306 Clinton: 232  2020: Biden 306 Trump: 232  In the 8 elections including 1988, there were 5 elections where a candidate got greater than 400 electoral votes. They are:  1964: Johnson: 486 Goldwater: 52 1972: Nixon: 521 McGovern: 17  1980: Reagan: 489 Carter: 49 1984: Reagan: 525 Mondale: 13 1988: Bush: 426 Dukakis: 112  In 2 of the 5 elections, a candidate received 500+ electoral votes. It might be stated that candidate quality played a role in these landslide defeats, but candidate quality is based on public perception and the public was less partisan at that time. For example: a significant number of Democrats supported Reagan over Mondale or Republicans supported Johnson over Goldwater.  Since 1988, the losing candidate has received over 200 electoral votes in 5 of the 8 elections. It seems that no matter who the candidate is for each party, they are guaranteed to win a least 200 electoral votes. The political partisanship since the 1990s means a fewer number of people will cross over to vote for the nominee of the opposite party.  There is only one scenario where a candidate gets 400+ vote and that is due to a   significant third party candidate running.
Recently leaked documents showed that ExxonMobil did internal studies in the 1970s about climate change. It shows they were aware of its existence and lied about it for decades. What, if anything, should be done to punish ExxonMobil and other companies? Should this be investigated more? [Here's a link to the published paper discussing the documents.](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abk0063)  It proves that for decades, ExxonMobil (and likely others) has lied and misdirected governments, shareholders, and the public about climate change, its trajectory, and its effects.   Should governments and other bodies (the US, EU, UK, UN, etc) do investigations into this matter and/or punish these companies for knowingly lying to and misleading various world governments and organizations, shareholders, and the public?  Honestly, I'm a bit surprised it's not being discussed more.
Should the US Government do more to deal with our history with Hawaii    On Jan. 17, 1893, Hawaii’s monarchy was overthrown when a group of businessmen and sugar planters forced Queen Liliuokalani to abdicate. The coup led to the dissolving of the Kingdom of Hawaii two years later, its annexation as a U.S. territory and eventual admission as the 50th state in the union.  The first European contact with Hawaii was made in 1778 by Capt. James Cook. In the 19th century, traders and missionaries came to the islands from Europe and the United States. They often opposed the Hawaiian monarchy, favoring instead a British-style constitutional monarchy where the monarch held little power.  In 1874, David Kalakaua became king and sought to reduce the power of the white Missionary Party (later Reform Party) in the government. In 1887, angered by King Kalakaua’s extravagant spending and his attempts to dilute their power, a small group of Missionary Party members, known as the Hawaiian League, struck back against the king.   Led by Lorrin A. Thurston and Sanford B. Dole, the Hawaiian League drafted a new constitution that reduced the power of the king and increased the power of the cabinet and Legislature. It also extended voting rights to wealthy noncitizens, while excluding Asians and restricting access for native Hawaiians through land-owning and literacy provisions. Backed by a militia, the group used the threat of violence to force King Kalakaua to sign the constitution, which became known as the Bayonet Constitution.  King Kalakaua died in 1891 and was succeeded by his sister, Liliuokalani, who proposed a new constitution that would restore powers of the monarchy and extend voting rights for native Hawaiians. The queen’s actions angered many of Hawaii’s white businessmen, who formed a 13-member Committee of Safety with the goal of overthrowing the monarchy and seeking annexation by the United States.  On Jan. 16, Hawaiian Marshal Charles B. Wilson attempted to arrest the committee members and declare martial law, but his attempts were turned down by other government officials who feared violence. The next day, after a police officer was shot and wounded trying to halt the distribution of weapons to the Committee of Safety’s militia, the committee decided to put its coup into action. Near the queen’s ʻIolani Palace in Honolulu, the committee’s militia gathered and were joined by 162 U.S. Marines and Navy sailors who were ordered by John L. Stevens, U.S. Minister to Hawaii, to protect the committee. The queen surrendered peacefully to avoid violence.  The Committee of Safety established a provisional government headed by Mr. Dole. U.S. President Grover Cleveland opposed the provisional government and called for the queen to be restored to power, but the Committee of Safety established the Republic of Hawaii and refused to cede power. In 1895, Hawaiian royalists began a coup against the republic, but it did not succeed. Queen Liliuokalani was arrested for her alleged role in the coup and convicted of treason; while under house arrest, the queen agreed to formally abdicate and dissolve the monarchy.  In 1898, the United States annexed Hawaii. Hawaii was administered as a U.S. territory until 1959, when it became the 50th state.  In 1993, Congress issued an apology to the people of Hawaii for the U.S. government’s role in the overthrow and acknowledged that “the native Hawaiian people never directly relinquished to the United States their claims to their inherent sovereignty.” And, since 2000, Former [Senator Daniel K. Akaka of Hawaii, ](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/22/us/politics/hawaii-democrats-are-struggling.html) had repeatedly proposed to Congress the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act, also known as the Akaka Bill, which would extend sovereignty to 400,000 native Hawaiians.  The measure would give \[Native Hawaiians\] equivalent legal standing to American Indians and native Alaskans and lead to the creation of a governing body that would make decisions on \[their\] behalf … The governing body would also have the power to negotiate with federal and state authorities over the disposition of vast amounts of land and resources taken by the United States when the islands were annexed in 1898.”  Supporters say the bill is necessary to protect native culture and redress Hawaiians for past injustices. Opponents say the bill is unworkable and would create a racially divided state.  What are your thoughts on legislation that gives native Hawaiians more control over the land, culture and resources of the islands? Given your understanding of history, would you support or oppose a bill that grants more autonomy to native Hawaiians? Why?
RCV as a way of getting consensus Republican candidates In 2020, the Virginia Republican Party introduced a new primary system in which ranked-choice voting (RCV) can be used for voting, either with a traditional primary or a convention. The Trump-aligned Amanda Chase was seen as the frontrunner in the 2021 gubernatorial election with the support of the party base, while the eventual primary and general winner, Glenn Youngkin, was anywhere between 2nd and 4th in opinion polling. However, when the convention came around, Chase finished no better than 3rd place in 5 rounds of voting, after which, she was eliminated. It is widely believed that Chase would've been the nominee if RCV had not been in place and Virginia would've seen a second McAuliffe administration. Lawmakers in 14 states are now considering using RCV in some form or another following the midterms, and in Arizona in particular, several Republicans are pushing for RCV in party primaries in order to weed out less consensus Republicans. Would this be a good strategy for the GOP to take as some in the party are now considering?
Could tying representatives compensation to annual approval ratings lead to a more representative democracy? Right now we have a challenge in politics as the concerns of capitalistic influences weigh heavier towards representation of corporate interests over the public's. Would somehow tying direct salary or annual bonus compensation directly to constituents approval ratings be a good measure to influence politicians to better represent their public?
Third war of independence in Chechnya? Do you think that, one more war for independence will break out in Chechenya after Russia's decline in arms and ammunition at the end of the Ukraine invasion?  Also at this point Putin won't have enough resources to back Kadyrov.   I think that will be a perfect opportunity for chechens to again fight back against russia for independence, many chechens commanders who are in Ukraine war fighting against russia said, they will go to Chechenya after this war gets over.  What do you think will happen?
How can we reduce the 'market demand' for illegal immigration? Instead of making it physically or bureaucratically more difficult to enter the country in order to deter illegal immigration, what can be done to make it less 'needed' in the first place? How can we help to make sure that that arduous trek isn't their best option?
Who would be the best person for Trump to pick as a running mate and realistically who will he pick? It's been reported that Trump has an unofficial shortlist for his VP pick: [Donald Trump’s Shortlist of Vice President Picks All Have One Thing in Common (thedailybeast.com)](https://www.thedailybeast.com/donald-trumps-shortlist-of-vice-president-picks-all-have-one-thing-in-common)  To save you the need to go into the article, the top three on the list are:  * **Tulsi Gabbard** \- Former Representative for HI-02 from 2013 to 2021, sought Democrat nomination for President in 2020 * **Marjorie Taylor Greene** \- Representative for GA-14 since 2021 * **Elise Stefanik** \- Representative for NY-21 since 2015  Others mentioned:  * **Kari Lake** \- Unsuccessful Arizona Governor Candidate 2022 * **Kristi Noem** \- Governor of South Dakota since 2019  It is a very mixed bag. Who would be the best or worst person for him to pick? And who do you think he will end up going for?
Why has the integration of immigrants in Scandinavian and some other Western European countries been much harder than in UK, Canada, US, and Australia? One issue I've never been able to wrap my head around is why the issue of integration of refugees and immigrants in countries such as Sweden and Denmark has faced so many headwinds, when compared to the Anglosphere (in particular the US and Canada).   I understand that proportionally, Western Europe takes in more immigrants on average than the US does. However, when we look at Canada whose immigration numbers are more comparable to other W. European nations, there is a much higher success rate with integration and upward mobility for immigrants than in Europe.   On many European subreddits the common complaint is that the immigrants in question "refuse to assimilate" and "don't learn the language." However on the other side of the fence, immigrants to Sweden complain that they don't have adequate resources available to help them get productive. It appears that this issue has not been resolved, and has led to a serious rising tension w/i the countries between the two groups (immigrants and European nationals). It's gotten so bad that many far right-wing groups have risen to power (such as Sweden Democrats), or at least increased in popularity considerably. Their anti-immigrant rhetoric has gained more and more traction in the past decade....  So, what is holding back these countries from integration of immigrants? What are the missing pieces?
Will potential GOP presidential candidates unite behind Ron DeSantis to defeat Trump? The popularity of Trump has waned within the GOP and there is an increasing the chance he won't win the GOP nominee unless he faces a crowded primary field. This happened in 2016 and they must have learnt their lesson.  In 2016 there was a large field of candidates united against Trump, but the problem was that they split the vote. In early primaries Trump only won a plurality of the votes in each state but won most of the delegates. This gave Trump momentum which meant that when the other candidates dropped out Trump became was the frontrunner.   If the republicans have learnt their lesson, they need to all unite behind Ron DeSantis to prevent trump from winning. Trump is unlikely to win as a majority of Republicans are against Trump. The only thing preventing this is that each potential GOP nominee has an ego and thinks they can win.  The GOP must know that Ron DeSantis is the only candidate who can beat Trump. If he becomes the nominee, he is favoured to win the election over the Democratic candidate. The Democrats don’t have a candidate who can unite the party and win nationwide. Biden is still their best candidate despite his age and popularity.   This is all dependent on whether potential nominees put party above personal ambition.
Are we living the last days of Capitalism and Democracy as we know them ? I was wondering if people expect things to change considerably in the near future politically and economically as we see the divide between the rich and the poor becoming considerably wider, there is a repetitive economical crisis, basic needs such as housing, food, transport, energy are becoming more expensive despite the technological advancement and the prospect of many middle class high paid jobs disappearing because of Artificial Intelligence. What is your opinion?
What is the likelihood of the GOP winning the presidential election popular vote in the near future? The GOP have lost the presidential popular vote in 7 of the last 8 presidential elections. The 2004 popular vote win was attributed to Bush's popularity after 9/11.  They have won 3 of the last 8 presidential elections, losing the popular vote in 2000 and 2016. In 2000, Bush received 500,000 less votes than Gore. In 2016, Trump received 3 million less votes than Clinton.  The popular vote is moot as we use a FPTP winner takes all Electoral college in 48 out of 50 states + DC. Nebraska and Maine split some of their electoral votes by congressional districts. However, it is interesting to consider whether the GOP can win the national popular vote any time soon.  Changing demographics and rightward shift means it is likely the Democrats will win the national popular vote for the foreseeable future. The only chance of the GOP winning the popular vote is if they shift back to the centre. Although, if Democrats nominate a hard left candidate, this could help the GOP win the popular vote regardless.
What would happen if the parliamentary majority were dependent on the SNP, following the next election in UK? Since December 2021, the opinion polls in the UK are suggesting that there is a high possibility that the parties in power and opposition will change drastically after the next election.   Most opinion polls at the moment are suggesting that Labour Party could be winning a majority of seats and could trade positions with the current-ruling Conservative Party. But the latest date for the next election is set at January 24th, 2025, and this means a lot might still change.  Pressure will start to show on the Labour Party, and polls are currently suggesting that Keir Starmer, leader of Labour Party, is fairly unpopular.  According to a poll made on January 4th, 2023 ([https://twitter.com/LeftieStats/status/1611346978096439296](https://twitter.com/LeftieStats/status/1611346978096439296)) only 58% of Lab voters have a favorable view of Keir Starmer, with 21% having an unfavorable view and 31% saying don't know. For all voters it is 30% favorable, 31% don't know, 39% unfavorable.  This is just one thing that suggets that Labour's high polling numbers may be fairly fragile.  With this, there are reasons to believe that the Conservatives and Labour may both get a fairly bad election result, and this could mean that they would have to look to other parties to have a parlimentary majority.   Because of the first-past-the-post, SNP has more seats that they would have in a proportional election model. For instance they got 7.3% of the total UK seats last election with 3.9% of the total UK vote.  Not much suggets they will do much worse at the next election, so let's imagine they get 7.3% (48) of the seats again.  Labour and Conservatives might both just fail to get above 300 seats. There was even a poll in August 2022 that had this as the results (if votes are projected onto Electoralcalculus). This would see Labour with 297 seats, Conservatives with 269 seats and Lib Dems with 13 seats. Both of them are nowhere near having a majority (326 is needed for a majority, although this is usually lowered to somewhere around 321-323 as Sinn Fein doesn't take their seats).  No party could have enough parliamentary seats without the SNP. Then if either Labour or the Conservatives wanted to make a government, they would need to work with the SNP.  What would happen?  Labour knows they might lose voters if they caved in on the giving Scotland a second referendum, so if they chose to work together with the SNP, they might lose their high polling numbers, and after 13 years of being in opposition, they would be extra careful on doing something that might cause them to lose a lot of voters to the Conservatives again.   The Conservatives are probably even less likely than Labour to give a referendum, and even if they did  , the SNP could be reluctant to not be in opposition to a government led by the Conservatives  But the SNP has everything on the line too. If they decided not  od emand a Scottish independence referendum in return for their parliamentary support, they would be seen as a joke and it's quite unlikely they'd just give up on the referendum.  If a new election was called after that election, this could also hurt Labour a lot, as they could be seen as incapable of leading the country if they couldn't make a government after getting the most seats.
US Politics Debate: If we removed both former Pres. Trump and Pres. Biden from the 2024 presidential race, who would be good choices to replace them, either in a two or more party election? With the current news cycle focusing on the various issues surrounding former Pres. Trump and the most recent issues involving Pres. Biden and the now-found classified documents, I'm curious to hear people's thoughts on who would be solid US presidential candidates if neither one ran for president in 2024.
With talks about some Republican congress members looking to reduce spending on social programs like Medicare and Medicaid, what are the alternatives to reducing these key safety nets? The official rules package Republicans passed calls for equal or greater cuts in mandatory spending to offset any new spending, but it did not specify where those cuts needed to come from.   The bulk of mandatory spending is for entitlement programs, which are social welfare programs with specific requirements.  Entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare make up the bulk of mandatory spending. Together they account for nearly 50 percent of the federal budget.  Other mandatory spending programs include Income Security Programs such as the Earned Income Tax Credit, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Supplemental Security Income, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and Unemployment Insurance. Federal Retirement programs for Federal and Civilian Military Retirees, Veterans programs, and various other programs that provide agricultural subsidies are also included in mandatory spending.
Could the Democrats keep control of the Senate in 2024? The Senate map is highly unfavourable to the Democrats in 2024. They are defending 23 seats whereas the Republicans are defending just 9 seats. This is almost identical to the 2018 election map where Democrats made a net loss of 2 seats in a blue wave midterm election year. These senate elections coincide with a presidential election which drives up turnout.  If the Democrats lose the presidency, then the GOP need only a net gain of 1 seat. If the Democrats win the presidency, then the GOP still only need a net gain of 2 seats.  They battleground states are likely to be Arizona, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin.  All them are currently held by Democrats. Therefore, the GOP will likely suffer no net loses, so will probably have at least 49 seats.  Out of the 9 tossup seats, the Democrats must win AZ, MI, NV, PA, VA, WI to stand any chance of keeping Senate Control. They favour the Democrats although AZ is difficult to call due to the Sinema factor.  This likely leaves MT, OH and WV where the Republicans are favoured. Trump comfortably won these states in 2020. These seats could decide Senate control.    Ohio is likely to flip to the GOP. It is now a solid red state. The 2018 midterm blue wave carried Sherrod Brown to victory. With the presidency on the ballot, the GOP turnout will be high.  Both MT and WV have a good chance of flipping to the GOP. The popularity of Manchin and Tester, if they run, gives the Democrats a chance to hold one or both seats. Manchin has a greater chance of holding on though as he is more conservative.  After the 2024 senate elections, the GOP will likely hold at least 51 seats. The best result the Dems can get is a 50-50 senate.
What will be the electoral impact for the GOP as it returns to Tea Party type politics? In the post-Trump era we have slowly started to see the GOP revert back to Tea Party type of politics. This was accelerated and greatly put on display during Kevin McCarthy's fight to win the speakership.  While the GOP has always been for cutting entitlement programs, they seemed to not talk about it very much during the era of Trump. We have started to see a return of them talking about this once again.  What will be the political impact of this in a Post-Covid America? It seems that public opinion has shifted fairly to the left on fiscal policy in the last 10 years or so, will this hurt the GOP politically?
China's rise has been meteoric in part due to its massive workforce and authoritarian-led production efficiency. Can India, which now boasts the world's single-largest country population ever capture the same power of China? Why not? That's  my main question. The next, related to population, is how will China  contend with their dwindling population figures, and when/what will  happen at that time?  Third  question, with Russia's population so small, is there a time when they  will reasonably be considered a second rate power? Or are they already  considered a second rate power?
Would it be smart if one of the two political parties started recruiting candidates because they are good looking? I feel like every other industry that creates “stars” whether it be music, movies, TV shows, etc. favors the good looking. Most pop stars are good looking, most movie stars are good looking. High profile politicians are “stars” that have some level of celebrity status. But very few of them are good looking, and most of them are old.   What if one party started recruiting and promoting good looking candidates? Would that be an electoral advantage?
Can something be done to counter misinformation without violating the first amendment? We all know just how tricky and damaging online misinformation actually is. We have laws against libel and slander, but they are difficult to prosecute (and likely for good reason), as they require proof of damages done as a result of the fraudulent statements. However, the realm of speech relating to individuals and politics is far different, with political disinformation contributing to the divisiveness that exists not only in the U.S., but in Europe as well.   Europe, unlike the US, however, doesn't have the right to free speech enshrined in their various constitutions, making tackling misinformation while preserving a free speech a more complex issue, as the right to free speech is a cornerstone of American rights. Is there anything that can be done to counter this misinformation?
Would a law that requires all campaign donations be from the jurisdiction they would oversee be a good idea? Presidential campaigns of course would be unaffected, but representatives and senators would only be able to receive donations from people in their state and local elections would similarly be limited in scope.   I understand that I, a midwesterner, would still be greatly impacted by a southern senator election that would impact the makeup of the senate, but should my financial influence govern how people swing in a state I don’t live in?   Would this contribute to disenfranchisement, because it would further entrench certain states to one party rule? Or would it help elected officials truly represent their constituents?  Is there a benefit in, say, Wyoming only having a small amount of money that can go to campaigns?   could this help corruption?
What are your thoughts on many Russians identifying themselves as “apolitical”? Since the Ukraine war broke out I’ve been watching a lot of interviews with civilians from within Russia, most notably from the YT-channel 1420.   When people are asked about Putin or the war, most just respond that they are “apolitical”.   I’ve learned to know that Russians are not as misinformed that we in the west assume. They just seem to not have a voice.   Do you think it would be different if the war affected them more? Do you think the Russian people can and should do more against the power? Will they be remembered as bystanders to a horrifying war or will people show compassion to their predicament once the war is over?   I can’t imagine how it feels like to live in a regime like that, but personally it’s very easy to see them as cowardly bystanders to a brutal slaughter of civilian Ukrainians and it’s likely that they will be remembered as such.   For me it’s also hard to understand that people just continue living their lives when their last 2-400 years of governments have repeatedly used them as cannon fodder.  I try to empathize with them and I’m not sure what I would do in their place, but it feels like they should do something?

What could the United Nations do for Ukraine? (international law) I know the GA had an emergency special session invoking the uniting for peace resolution but can they actually implement the use of force since that is normally only a competence of the Security Council? And would that resolution then become binding or not? because the GA resolutions are never binding.  What else could the UN do for Ukraine with regards to resolutions and laws. Could they condemn or influence Russia in any way? Not talking about humanitarian aid. Curious to know your answers.
What would President Biden´s options be to supply Ukraine (or Taiwan for that matter) with military and non military assistance if Congress does not pass his requested legislation? This seems like an example where you could argue emergency powers could be used. Not hard to come up with arguments why it could be.  Ordinary legislation would be hard because of a divergent legislative majority, although opposition would arise of course, and might depend on whether McCarthy is able to prevent a bill from being voted on.  What is the scope of his powers to do this? I know that he has access to the 1974 National Emergencies Act but most powers are pretty vague.
From a purely technical standpoint, can the United States government even be overthrown? Invasion, revolution, whatever the name you wanna give it, from what I can tell a successful one always goes the same way: The government in question is like "I concede to the aggressors, I am stepping down and ceding control to them. I surrender."  But how would that work today in the United States? If Biden is like "Y'know what, I give up," what about all the senators and whatnot? Who actually holds the keys? If there is any one single person or group? Because if not, I think the United States is conquer-proof on this technicality. Regardless of whose arms are stronger, there's simply no way to surrender the government to invaders even if you were the President and you wanted to.
How come ethics violations are not considered serious crimes for politicians? Ethics are to ensure a politicians represent their constituents honorably.  Violating this trust is rather serious, yet the punishments seem like slaps on the wrist.  The case of George Santos and the fact he may stay seems like there is a severe problem.    So why should these crimes be minor offenses?  Do they have mechanism to deal with the violations of the like of George Santos?  If so, why aren’t they being used?
If there is a crowded Repulican Primary, should DeSantis throw his hat in the ring, endorse Trump, or stay neutral? Right now polling indicates that DeSantis's strength is with non-Trumpers. If many candidates run again, that could cut into his support and make him finish a close 2nd. This will not only hand the primary to Trump but also anger Trump's base.   However, DeSantis' star may not shine as bright in 2028 as it did it 2024. His claim to fame is his anti-lockdown policies, and voters would likely forget about it soon. Christie lost his chance when he waited until 2020. Would the same happen for DeSantis?  Might he ask Trump for a VP role instead in exchange for his endorsement of Trump?   What shluld he do?
About Lula’s legacy… I keep up with politics a fair amount but as an American I’m often ignorant of important subjects that don’t effect my country a whole lot. One of these is president Lula. I just learned about him and, apparently, he’s an excellent leader from what I can tell. Reduced poverty, good environmental protection and other such stuff. He even had a 90% approval rating When leaving office which is nigh unheard of.  But Lula is apparently surrounded by scandals in his past and has had accusations of corruption. My question is, in light of his popularity and leftist populist victories, how valid are these corruption charges?
Why doesn't the United States have some sort of national "proposition" option for legislation (like states do)? Why do US states have propositions like "Prop 8", but there are none on a national scale? Would you support national "props"? Why or why not? I'm assuming the founding fathers designed it this way on purpose. I'm assuming because they foresaw a citizenry who would vote for legislation that isn't the best/smartest?  Are there any countries where this is a thing?  Example) Prop for federal legalization of marijuana where the vote/bill passes if 50%+ or 66%+ of the country's population votes 'yes'.
Katie Porter announces her 2024 California senate run. What chance does she have to get elected? Rep. Katie Porter just announced her senate candidacy for Dianne Feinstein’s senate seat. Katie Porter is a risking star in the Democratic Party who has already shown she can win competitive seats, so in theory, she would have a very easy time winning a California general election.  However, there will certainly be other names in the running, such as Adam Schiff and possibly other big names in California. Additionally, some people suggest most of Katie Porter’s fanbase is online. How would Porter do in this election, assuming other big names go for Feinstein’s seat?
How would you rate the 117th Congress? Looking back over the past two years, how would you rate the most recent Congress compared to other legislative sessions in the past few decades?  How much did they get passed and what sort of impact will the bills passed ultimately have? How did this compare to your expectations?  The largest bills passed were the American Rescue Plan, the Bipartisan Infrastructure build, and the Inflation Reduction act.  Other notable legislation includes the PACT act, CHIPs act, Postal Service Reform act, Safer Communities act, and Respect for Marriage Act among others.
Technology and American political discourse Franklin Roosevelt is usually credited for being the first politician to fully comprehend radio’s potential to communicate directly to the American public. In a similar vein, JFK harnessed television to outclass his competitors. Twitter undoubtedly played a significant role in the rise of Trump. What do we see for the future of technology and political discourse?
Why have revolutionary parties made no use of social media advertising to break the cultural hegemony and impose their narrative?  I'm thinking of how cheap social media advertising is. For example, $1 spent on a short video or an image on Facebook means reaching 1000 people. Why don't revolutionary parties make use of this to engage the population and to make their thoughts mainstream?
What is Islamic Soft Power? So I recently came across this article from Foreign Affairs wherein they talk about the rise of Islamic Soft power. So for context, Islam itself is not only a religion but it encompasses a way of life as well and is basically in every aspect of a Muslim's life. I was reading the article and came across this sentence, " Winning hearts and minds, however, is not necessarily the point. The use of Islamic soft power is meant to serve governments more than it serves Muslim publics". This definitely makes sense and resonates with me and many other Muslims. I will add the link to the article at the bottom.  My Questions for the political science lovers, are these:  1. What is Islamic Soft power? 2. What are the Pros and Cons of it? 3. Do you feel it's a viable way for a Muslim country to employ it as a form of soft power in the wider Muslim world? If so, how should they properly use it? If not, then why do you think they should refrain from it? 4. Also this question is mainly for Muslims as I would like to hear their experience with this question, but I would love to hear from other people as well. How do you view the Muslim countries' use of Islam in politics? Which country do you think is doing a better job and which are failing at it?   [https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2018-12-07/rise-islamic-soft-power?check\_logged\_in=1&utm\_medium=promo\_email&utm\_source=lo\_flows&utm\_campaign=registered\_user\_welcome&utm\_term=email\_1&utm\_content=20230103](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2018-12-07/rise-islamic-soft-power?check_logged_in=1&utm_medium=promo_email&utm_source=lo_flows&utm_campaign=registered_user_welcome&utm_term=email_1&utm_content=20230103)
What effect could third party candidates have in 2024? In 2016, third party candidates got 6% of the vote combined which was actually quite substantial.  However in 2020, they got less than 2% combined.  What way do we expect this to go in 2024?  And is there a chance that any member/former member of congress could run as an independent? Cheney, Amash, Sinema etc.
What are the political futures of the more notable members of the House of Representatives? The Title says it all. The fight for the speakership has given the spotlight to the House where it's normally hard to stick out in a crowd of 435 members. Whether it be the Squad (AOC, Omar, Tlaib etc) or the House Freedom Caucus (Gaetz, Boebert and Greene). What trajectory do you see these politicians on? Do you see them losing primaries, their seats or make attempts for higher office? For the record, it doesn't have to just be these 2 groupings, but any house member that makes the media pay attention to them. So Dan Crenshaw and Katie Porter can be included.
Should MAGA embrace progressive economics? do they have anything to gain from this? Since COVID we've seen the center of the democratic party become more open to progressive policies. The Biden administration has taken a decisively more progressive approach to economic policy than would have been acceptable even during just the Obama years.  With all this it seems like neoliberal capitalist policies are becoming increasingly unpopular as people want bigger controls on corporations. This effort has mostly been driven by the Democrats.  However, in the past, whenever one of the parties established a new economic paradigm (such as FDRs New deal or Reagan's neoliberalism) the opposing party eventually adopted it as well. Will we see the same happen with the Republican party?  I think the republican party has much to gain from this. They are experiencing heavy backlash due to their conservative social policy, best exemplified by the overturning of Roe V. Wade.   Could the Republican party win back votes not by backtracking on their social policy, but by embracing progressive economics?  What do you think, could this be a viable way for the Republicans to get out of the tough situation they find themselves in?  EDIT: Keep in mind that neoliberalism and MAGA are two different things however they work together within the Republican party.  So what I'm referring to is potentially a republican party that accepts progressive economics but is still against abortion, LGBTQ right, etc.
Bolsonaro supporters breached security barriers and gained access to the three branches of government. Bolsonaro has been visiting Trump at Mar a Lago, where he went shortly after losing election. He has not conceded his loss. Is this almost like a repeat of January 6, 2021, and how does it end? Supporters of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro on Sunday breached security barriers set up by the Armed Forces and gained access to key buildings for each of the three branches of government, including the congressional building, the Supreme Court and the Planalto Presidential Palace, according to images shown in Brazilian media.   Bolsonaro had previously claimed that he is cooperating with the transition team \[without conceding\]. Is he capable of returning back to power by force. The military does not appear to be backing him at this time, but it may divide the country further.   Is this almost like a repeat of January 6, 2021, and how does it end?

Based on the facts presented how you assess Indira Gandhi's time as Prime Minister of India? Would you say she was overall a good or bad leader? The daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi would herself go on to be the first female Prime Minister from 1966 to 1977 and then 1980 to 1984. Known as India's "Iron Lady" her style of leadership was one that was unbending and uncompromising, which would make her decisive and strong willed at her best, and controversial and stubborn at worst. These are a list of major events during her term:  **Operation Blue Star:** One of the last and controversial acts she approved, it was a military operation against Sikh separatists in India. The separatists factions in Punjab were motivated by a complicated set of factors related to autonomy for Sikhs in the region as well as cultural recognition. This led to an insurgency against the central government after political negotiations failed. The leader of this insurgency took up residency in the Golden Temple of Amritsa, Sikhism's holiest shrine. After negotiations failed, and due to reports of Pakistani intelligence supporting the insurgents, Indira Gandhi order the military to storm the Golden Temple. The resulting operation resulted in wide scale civilian casualties(5000 civilians). The backlash to this would be her assassination in 1984.  **The Emergency(1975-1977):** This was a state of Emergency from 1975-1977 that Indira Gandhi imposed in response to political opposition, national security threats, and limitations imposed by India's courts. Essentially it suspended Habeus Corpus and gave the government the arbitrary power to arrest opponents deemed a security threat. During this period she also instituted a controversial constitutional amendment that gave the executive branch the power to limit decisions from the courts. The most controversial policy though was the arbitrary sterilisation policy implement to deal with the impact India's population growth had on issues related to poverty.  **The Indo-Pakistan War of 1971:** This war started out as the war of independence Bangladesh waged against Pakistan's occupation of the region. In response the Pakistani government and military instituted Operation Search Lighlight. This would lead to the Bangladesh Genocide of 1971 where the highest estimates are that 3 million people were exterminated and 200,000-300,000 Benghali women subject to genocidal rape. Indira Gandhi supported the Benghal resistance fighters and drafted plans to intervene. The Indian military brass hesitated due to fears of the Monsoon but Indira Gandhi dismissed this and ordered the preparation of war. Pakistan, in an effort to outmanoever India launched a pre-emptive air raid on India. Indira Gandhi responded with a full scale ground and naval assault on Pakistan as well as a blitzkrieg assault in conjunction with the Benghal resistance fighters. The result was that India won the 1971 war in less than 2 weeks, Bangladesh gained its independence and the worst genocide since the Holocaust at the time ended.  **The Green Revolution:** This was a policy to rapidly change India's approach to agricultural production. Initially India was a country that imported more food than they produced and it was also a country were famines were common for centuries. The Indian government starting under her predecessor but reaching its height under her radically changed agricultural policy through the introduction of mechanised farming as well as the heavy use of pesticides and fertilisers. On the one had it had a negative environmental impact with massive losses in biodiversity, a negative impact on the water supply and a rise in farmer suicide. On the other hand it made India self sufficient when it came to food production(not dependent on the Great powers like America or the U.K for food imports) and it ended the era of mass famines where millions would die from a lack of food.  **Operation Flood:** This was a policy promoted to increase India's milk production. Initially India was a milk deficient nation. This was done through the introduction of skim milk production, as well as increasing the development of dairy animals in rural areas. This ended India's status as a milk deficient nation and transformed it into the largest producer of milk globally, making up 22% of the global market as well as increasing domestic production for the average consumer.  **Socio-economic reforms:** As the first Female PM she introduced equal pay legislation into the Indian constitution. In addition to this, she used the state of emergency powers granted to initiate land ceilings on wealthy land lords as well as the redistribution of land to the poor, dalits and those who were a part of the untouchable class. She instituted massive nationalisation programs in the steel, banking, copper and coal industries. In addition to this she laid the foundations for India institutions of Space technology which would produced and launch hundreds of domestic and foreign satellites for space research, 2 missions to the moon, as well as one mission to Mars.  Other actions taken during her time include transforming India into a nuclear armed power, and increasing India's role in the Commonwealth which would include India playing a prominent role in the formulation of the global boycott of apartheid South Africa.
How frequently will members of Congress use the motion to vacate? With the concession of allowing only one member to force a vote, how likely is it that they will start each session with “a prayer, a pledge, and a motion to vacate”? Will Dems use this tactic to stall Republican legislation? Will moderate R’s use it in retaliation for the concessions given to the Freedom Caucus?
what is George santos' best course of action? Title. Is there any way that George Santos can keep his seat? Is him getting voted out assured? What possible consequences might he face?  George Santos is a republican from New York who recently faced a big scandal regarding several lies he told about his life while on the campaign trail. For example, he claimed he was Jewish when he in fact wasn't. His defense was "I said I was jew-ish" etc.   Is there any way Santos can save himself?
Why did Laura Loomer recently begin to attack other republicans a lot lately? In fact, Her twitter post that is made after she got unbanned mostly consist of her attacking other republicans and very much less attack on democrats....

Your vote does nothing if you're in the minority of a voting district, so what is your case against adopting proportional representation in US elections? For you who are against it, why do you not support proportional representation in US Presidential and House of Representatives elections?  Basic information on [proportional representation in election systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_representation).   **Bonus question:** If someone ran on a single issue platform of championing voter reform with the promise they would resign after legislation passed, would you 'waste' your vote on them?
Why does it seem that the Democrat Party is so resistant to changes from Progressives? Over the past 15 years, Republicans have had the "Tea Party", "America First", and "Freedom Caucus" movements that have resulted in major changes within their party.    This has led to a major challenge to the "establishment", as evidenced by the Speaker votes this week.  After the 2018 and 2020 elections, Progressives found themselves in a similar situation as the Freedom Caucus does today.  They could have challenged the vote for Pelosi as effectively as we have seen for the past week.  That being said, why have the Democrats been so resistant to pressure from the Progressives?
Rep. Ralph Norman (R, S.C.) introduces term limits bill for that applies to all U.S. Federal Lawmakers. Does this garner enough support to pass? Some show support for term limits, but others support the idea that experience is advantageous. Does a Term Limits Bill have enough public pressure at this point to pass, or is it not a "hot button" topic? Do sitting elected officials believe in term limits, or do they prefer the open-endedness of the current standard? Do term limits create additional road blocks for national security, improvement and stability? Do they ensure our elected officials are not taking advantage of their position and power? Countries that DO HAVE term limits...How do you feel about it?
What lessons can or should "The Squad" and the Progressive Caucus take from the debacle demonstrated by the Republicans with their election of a Speaker for the next time Democrats take the majority? I'm wondering whether the progressive wing of the Democratic caucus is emboldened by the power play the Freedom Caucus and "The Five" just pulled off in extracting concessions from Kevin McCarthy and the Republican leadership, or will the Democratic progressives feel like they'll risk too much blowback from the establishment Democrats, the media, and the public in general if they try similar tactics that the right wing of the Republicans accomplished?
With McCarthy now being chosen as House Speaker, the attention and of the house will move to a rules package vote on Monday. Will there be a possible fight on the vote for the rules with moderate Rs, due to the large amount of concessions McCarthy made to get the speakership? Due to all of the concessions that were made to the members of the House Freedom Caucus in the rules package(which details were made public), it may be likely that some moderates will not support the package. One representative had already agreed not to vote for the package, and more could follow. With the newly-elected Speaker McCarthy hanging on by a thread due to the only 1-vote rule, could this vote on Monday lead to more chaos and division on the House floor?
Should the US Congress and state legislatures have the power to override parts of the Bill of Rights like in Canada? Like the Constitution of the United States, the Constitution of Canada also has a bill of rights known as the [***Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms). However, unlike the US Bill of Rights which are 100% absolute and inalienable insofar as how the judiciary interprets those rights, large parts of the Canadian Bill of Rights are subject to [**parliamentary supremacy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_sovereignty) In order to obtain the political support necessary to enact a new formal constitution in 1982, [**Section 33 of the** ***Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_33_of_the_Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms), also commonly known as the **notwithstanding clause**, authorizes Parliament or provincial legislatures to override sections 2 and 7 through 15 of the *Charter* with no legal limit. This means that by invoking this clause, they can freely enact any laws that violate the rights guaranteed in those sections and judicial review cannot stop them. All laws invoking this clause are only in force for up to five years but they could be renewed by their legislature any number of times.  In Canada, the rights that could legally be overridden include:  * Section 2 (fundamental freedoms): freedom of conscience, freedom of religion, freedom of thought, freedom of belief, freedom of expression, freedom of the press and of other media of communication, freedom of peaceful assembly, and freedom of association * Section 7: right to life, liberty, and security of the person * Section 8: freedom from unreasonable search and seizure * Section 9: freedom from arbitrary detention or imprisonment * Section 10: right to legal counsel and the guarantee of habeas corpus * Section 11: rights in criminal and penal matters such as the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty * Section 12: right not to be subject to cruel and unusual punishment * Section 13: rights against self-incrimination * Section 14: right to an interpreter in a court proceeding * Section 15: equal treatment before and under the law, and equal protection and benefit of the law without discrimination  Although the Canadian federal government has never invoked this clause, it has been used at the provincial level multiple times in the last 40 years especially by Quebec. For example, the Superior Court of Quebec stated that Quebec's [Bill 21](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_respecting_the_laicity_of_the_State) violates freedom of expression and freedom of religion but had to uphold it since the notwithstanding clause was explicitly invoked.  **Should the US Constitution have its own notwithstanding clause?**
Why won’t Joe Biden use the War Powers Act to redirect production by private and public companies to produce more defense/humanitarian equipment to send to Ukraine? It was used in WWII the last time the Russians presented a menace to Europe, so why not invoke it to arm as many Ukrainians as possible since they are all willing to die fighting Putin and his westward expansion?
McCarthy won after some hold outs voted present lowering the threshold. Under the new rules will he manage to pass legislation which will not be DOA at the Senate. Can he still manage to be an effective leader, notwithstanding the new rules and work with Democrats without fear of call to vacate? The recently released new rules proposal points to the potential pitfalls. Practical effects of the more conservative members of his groups \[Gaetz, Biggs, Jordan, Greene and Bobbert...\]; is it still possible to get legislation through, which will not be dead on arrival to the Senate.  New Rules:  [https://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20230102/118-Rules-of-the-House-of-Representatives-SxS.pdf](https://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20230102/118-Rules-of-the-House-of-Representatives-SxS.pdf)  Aside from debt ceiling issues, balanced budget amendments...Under one of the new rules a single member of his party can ask to vacate and seek a floor vote. If McCarthy tried to get some votes from the Democrats for his agenda that too entails risks because he may well lose his speakership.  Can McCarthy still manage to be an effective leader, notwithstanding the new rules and work with Democrats without fear of call to vacate?

What would happen if the US defaulted on its debt? In his quest for being Speaker,[it appears Kevin McCarthy has decided to negotiate away any increase in the debt ceiling](https://crooksandliars.com/2023/01/we-now-know-deal-mccarthy-made-freedom) to the rightmost elements of the House.   This will inevitably set off another high stakes standoff with debt default on the table.   So what are the stakes - what would happen to the economy and the status of the dollar as a reserve currency?
Implications of change regarding voting for new House speaker As I understand it, one of the rule changes Kevin McCarthy has agreed to in his quest for US house speaker is that a single person can initiate a vote to potentially remove that speaker. Can you help me think through the implications of that rule?  - Do you think it would turn into yet another round of the Freedom Caucus blocking anything from happening?   - Would the democrats have any reasons to vote to retain McCarthy? Or would they try to sway frustrated, more moderate republicans to vote for Jeffries or another person who isn’t part of the drama happening now?  - What other implications to such a rule do you see?  - Would the answers to such questions depend on the other rules adopted by the rules committee?
Would any concessions McCarthy makes to the Freedom Caucus actually have a tangible effect? Congress is split, which means that legislatively nothing much would be happening right now even if there were a sitting House of Representatives. Certainly if they manage to drag this out until September it will be a headache for the federal budget, but what would those on the left or in the center have to fear if McCarthy actually made good on some of the reported concessions the Hard Right have asked for? Nothing the Freedom Caucus could put in a bill would pass the Senate; it may not even pass the House with the slim margin the GOP has, especially considering the dissenters are doing their best to dissolve any rapport they might have had with their colleagues.   Is there any reason to be concerned about the potential concessions the far right may get out of the House Republicans before this situation resolves?
Is North Korea broken beyond repair? Did the WPK succeed in building a dictator's "dreamland"? Well, the world is full of countries that are not-free (in the western sense of the word) or have a history of human right abuse. However, in most cases, one can still see a room for maneuver when it comes the possibility of achieving democracy, improving the human record, or increasing the prosperity of the whole country, even if the ruling class, party, or dictator are does not intend to.  Let's take Egypt for example (I'm an Arab, although not Egyptian). Most people have access to internet, so critics and political dissenters can still find a way to affect the collective opinion, and discuss the public life without government interference. Additionally, and although the country doesn't fare very great when it comes to ease of doing business, you can still establish private enterprises, and in a way increase the wealth of the whole country and its people. This of course goes against the interest of dictators, since it's always better to keep your mind occupied with survival, instead of devoting their times to "dangerous" activities such as critical thinking. Of course, Sisi is no saint, but he's not crazy enough to follow the North Korean path.  However, the North Korean situation seems kinda hopeless:  * The people are completely isolated from the outer world. There's no access to telephones, internet, books, or any form of free media. * The people are uneducated, starved, probably brain-washed, and were taught to be obedient since a very young age. * The ruling class consist of a group of the most stupid, crazy, insecure, and inhuman people to ever step on earth. The Saudi ruling class, for instance, is oppressive for sure, but they don't it if sections of their society led a comfortable life. * The country is poverty-stricken and people can barely make ends meet. * The country is already too old. There's barely any people who are familiar with a different way of life. * The regime possess an arsenal of nuclear weapons, so any kind of foreign intervention seems nearly impossible.  So, do you think that the WPK has managed to build the perfect, and probably largest, slave empire in the modern world, with no possibility of a coup, an uprising, or any political change whatsoever? Are the North Korean, destined for a life of poverty, suffering, and oppression?  And before you ask, I live in a country ruled by an oppressive regime, and I'm interested in general in knowing when do countries become broken beyond repair, and what tools can be used to bring change to their political structure.
Reviewing Speaker elections where there were multiple votes suggests conservatives have a harder time working together than liberals I was curious about historical Speaker elections and was wondering if there were any interesting trends and put this together: https://imgur.com/a/QcYaXa3  According to my limited knowledge, of the past 15 contested Speaker elections, 10 happened during conservative majorities while 5 happened during liberal ones. Not a strong correlation, but certainly interesting one.  Is it possible that compromise and teamwork are more challenging within the conservative ideology?  Is it at odds with some fundamental, underlying beliefs?    Building, this table of [US representatives who switched parties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_representatives_who_switched_parties) shows Democrats are much more likely to change over to Republican, but the reverse is comparatively rare (just 4 times compared to 18 Democrats to Republicans).  Are Democrats harsher on their own, chasing them out? Are Republican more staunch in their beliefs and less likely to go against the larger group?  Does this correlate with the Speaker election disparity?  You can see similar patterns [in this table too](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_American_politicians_who_switched_parties_in_office_).  Anyway, thought it might spark an interesting discussion!  Disclaimer: I am barely American (lived there less than a year), so please forgive me if anything is inaccurate; trying to understand party lineage and the ideology shift was surprisingly challenging.
ChatGPT and it's influence in politics. I was fooling around with chatGPT open ai today and it's ability to understand context and rhetoric. For one of my prompts I had it give me an analysis of trumps debates in 2016. I'm curious how you all think this technology will come to impact politics and our understanding of the debate format. what if an ai were used to host debates or moderate in real time to call out fallacies?
Why, in America, does compromise always move to the Right? Why not the middle? Especially with the current House Speaker vote, political compromise has always seemed to move to the right. I would imagine that Democrats and Republicans would compromise toward the center, but it all seems to move in the same direction.
What would happen if the US drew all congressional district lines to be as competitive as possible? Would a significant reduction in the number of “safe” seats have a positive outcome? Only about 60 districts are within a 10pt margin. Candidates don’t have to worry about competing with another party, they have to worry about competing against someone from their own party with more extreme views pushing our representation further away from the citizenry. Would this solution encourage more policy discussion in good faith, result in more moderate candidates, are their risks Im not thinking about?
What are the pros and cons of Kevin McCarthy reaching across the isle and getting 20+ Democrats to vote for him for Speaker of the House? The U.S. House adjourned for a third night without a speaker — the longest the chamber has gone leaderless in generations — after GOP leader Kevin McCarthy lost an 11th vote for the gavel and scrambled to work out a deal with far-right Republicans to back his bid.  The House plans to reconvene at noon ET on Friday, as McCarthy and his allies try to iron out a rough offer that would give hardline conservatives more power in the new GOP majority.  Ahead of Thursday’s final speaker vote, two members of the bloc of 20 Republican holdouts opposing McCarthy’s speakership nominated alternative candidates to McCarthy: The first pick was GOP Rep. Kevin Hern of Oklahoma, who leads the influential Republican Study Committee. The second nominee was former President Donald Trump, who was put forward by his longtime ally, Florida GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz.  Hern has consistently voted for McCarthy for speaker, but he has not said outright that he would reject the job if McCarthy withdraws his name.  The emergence of another potential alternative to McCarthy was the latest setback in a frustrating day for the longtime GOP leader. Meanwhile, Democrats appeared to revel in the repeated GOP failures, enthusiastically shouting down a proposed voice vote to adjourn just before 8 p.m. ET on Thursday. Republicans then voted to end proceedings for the night in a recorded vote.  “We should stay here all night ... all weekend until we get a speaker,” Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., told CNN.  McCarthy lost 20 Republicans on the 11th vote, with one GOP member-elect voting “present.” With 222 Republicans in the newly elected House, he could afford to lose only four of them to reach the 218 needed to win the speakership.   The speaker election is now guaranteed to go at least 12 votes. It has gone longer than a dozen ballots only four times in U.S. history.  Earlier in the day, McCarthy sounded optimistic about talks between his top lieutenants and a group of holdouts.  “I think everyone in the conversation wants to find a solution,” McCarthy said on his way into the House chamber for the day’s first vote.
Which Republicans would you be OK supporting for speaker? I'm phrasing this question as if everyone here is not a republican... there is zero chance of a democrat being speaker. If someone on the republican side that had \~30 republicans could get all 212 democrats to vote for them, who would you be OK with that being?
What is stopping Kevin McCarthy and his party from accommodating the split Republicans to get the votes he needs from them to become House speaker? There have been over ten unsuccessful voting sessions to elect a House speaker. The split Republicans not voting for Kevin McCarthy, who is the most likely candidate to be elected, won't budge.  [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/01/04/us/politics/house-speaker-vote-tally.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/01/04/us/politics/house-speaker-vote-tally.html)  What is holding them back? Why are they disagreeing? If Kevin McCarthy accommodates the split Republicans will he lose support from others? Etc.
With 14 Republicans from districts Biden won in 2020 (9 of which by over 5%) why does it seem impossible to get six of them for Jefferies? Six is a more attainable number than the 20 McCarthy is trying to get and surely any republican who crosses over for this vote can play the bipartisanship card for some pr and then go back to sand bagging the Democrats agenda.  So why does it seem like an impossible outcome?  Like the title states, 14 Republicans are from districts Biden won in 2020.  9 of which by more than 5%.
What would have to happen to jeopardize the Republican majority in Congress? It was recently revealed that the only reason Santos was not put behind Brazilian bars is that the authorities lost track of him. We also know he is under several investigations for campaign finance irregularities. Given that things have somehow gotten even worse for George Santos before the 118th has even officially convened, the prospect of his departure from Congress should be considered. If Santos were to be investigated / indicted / etc. and ultimately removed from his seat in congress, New York would hold a special election the Republican majority would fall from 222 to 221. It's a long time until 2024, lots more could happen.  What else could realistically go wrong that could cause the Republicans to lose their majority even temporarily? Obviously, the chances of losing several seats simultaneously are very low, but it's not outside the realm of possibility. Please chime in with scenarios below.
What do you think about the “good governance” provisions in the proposed House Rules? Do they promote better governance and legislation? A big hang-up causing this speaker vote fiasco right now is the freedom caucus pushing for new House rules, a part of which, they claim would promote better governance and a more active legislature.   Some of the new rules would include proposals to:  -	Limit bills to a single subject; -	Make it harder to waive the germaneness rule for amendments; -	Expand the time between a bill’s introduction and its floor debate; -	Eliminate proxy voting;   There’s, of course, also a lot of nonsense in the new rules like the “Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government.” and stripping House employees of their collective bargaining rights.   But just looking at the rules that are supposed to change the way bills are debated and voted on, do you think this would improve the legislative process?  Edit: Let me make something more clear I don’t support McCarthy as speaker or want a GOP majority. And yes, lots of their proposals are awful and obstructionist. I am just curious about people thoughts on the specific rules which would govern bills and debate, and how that would change how legislation is written and debated.
Why did no one invade North Korea before it developed nuclear weapons? Hopefully this is the right place to post this. I’m mostly asking because I honestly don’t know and am curious, but I’d also be keen to hear whether people think this would have been justified.  It honestly kind of surprises me that no one did invade, especially the Western powers. It does seem like no one in their right mind would actually use nuclear weapons, but not everyone is in their right mind. I kind of get the feeling that Kim Jong-Un isn’t as unstable as he lets on and is playing into Nixon’s madman theory, but who knows? Maybe not.  America was obviously willing to take action when Iraq supposedly had WMDs, and the rhetoric around Iran certainly seems to indicate that at least Israel, if not the United States or Saudi Arabia, would intervene with armed force well before that country obtained nukes. So why not North Korea?  I would guess at the following reasons, from the least likely to the most:  1. It would violate the international principle of refraining from invading a nation without explicit military provocation.  2. The relatively recent precedents set by the invasions of Vietnam (by Japan, then France, then the US), Afghanistan (by the USSR, then the US), Kuwait (by Iraq), Afghanistan (by the US/NATO), and Iraq (by the US and allies) are ones of relatively limited success and have turned people off of invasions in general (also the Russian invasion of Ukraine supports this sentiment, but obviously that hadn’t happened at the time North Korea achieved nuclear capability).  3.  The possibility that China, another nuclear power, would either defend North Korea militarily or impose sanctions that would devastate the global economy.  I think the world learned a lesson from the inaction of the democratic powers during Nazi land grabs leading up to the Second World War, but also learned a somewhat contradictory lesson from the more recent aforementioned wars. When is it better to be proactive and eliminate a threat to global safety and security before it’s too late, and when is it better to refrain from getting involved lest you provoke a war that might not have materialized otherwise and may very well only lead to future instability?
If Not McCarthy for House Speaker, Then Who? Following three votes to elect a Speaker, McCarthy fell short of the needed 218 votes.    Today Republicans will again attempt to elect a speaker but until that occurs, new House members can't be sworn in, rules to govern itself can be established and it can't consider legislation or create committee assignments.  New members of the House can't be sworrn in and legislative business is on hold.  McCarthy insists he can win the vote despite some Republicans, such as Gaetz,  who are firmly against him.  Possibile choices are Scalise (who labeled himself 'David Duke without the baggage'), Jim (Gym)Jordan who states  he doesn't want the position, Andy Briggs, and Elsie Stefanik.    The last time a House Speaker vote went to multiple ballots was 100 years ago. Since 1913 a Speaker was elected on the first ballot.  Back then the new Congress wasn't sworn in until Narch 1923 ...a full 13 months between the election and the voting in of the new speaker.   All 212 Democrats  voted for their own leader, Jeffries, but six Republicans would have to cross party lines for Jeffries to win the Speaker's position.  That appears very unlikely to happen.   Lawmakers can decide to skip the vote, or vote "present," which reduces the vote threshold needed to win the speakership. Speakers Nancy Pelosi, and John Boehner, both won the speakership without reaching 218 votes.  So what's your prediction on how this plays out? Will McCarthy need to remove his belongings from the Speaker's Office? Or will Republicans coalesce around him...or someone else?  Will Jeffries be the Speaker? Pelosi? Or will that rumor of nominating Trump come to the surface? After all...the House Speaker is third in line for the Presidency!
In search of the perfect president: What Americans say they want, from age to gender. What meta characteristics do you want in the next President? USA Today published an article about what characteristics Americans want in the next President. The article discussed age, gender, military service, etc.   What other characteristics do you want to see in Presidential candidates? IE education, prior political experience, career experience, marital status, religion, etc.    [USA TODAY LINK](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/12/27/presidential-election-2024-suffolk-poll/10929799002/)  Top Result of each Category  50% want a 50-65 year old  55% gender doesn’t matter  57% location doesn’t matter  Each party wants their party to have the next President.  57% a compromise leadership style  Dems want a Senator a Governor & GOP are inverse.  61% GOP voters want military experience  Dems 37% don’t.
Should Pelosi move to Suspend the rules and ask for a vote on a Minimum Wage bill by offering concessions on the Omnibus package passed last year? The speakers race could take months to sort out, while important legislation from the previous congress lingers.   Is it time for Democrats to offer concessions on the Omnibus package in exchange for support on a minimum wage bill? Adding native American house members?  Should the house try to vote on bills before a speaker is chosen?  Should Pelosi move to Suspend the rules and ask for a vote on a Minimum Wage bill or some other bills of importance to either side?  The Democrats could ask for a limited minimum wage bill that would allow states to opt out of the wage rules, in exchange for an increase in the federal minimum wage in the states that dont opt out. In exchange, the Republicans would get votes to support changes to the Omnibus bill.
What would America´s Congress behave as if it used some models from reforms used on state legislatures? Nebraska officially does not use a partisan system for organizing their legislature and electing it. They do not list party labels on the ballot. All candidates compete in the primary election and the two most popular go to the general election in November. As well, the speaker is elected by secret ballot with a runoff if necessary to achieve a majority, the committee members are chosen by a supercommittee elected in much the same way (though geographically organized), and the chairs of committees are elected just as the speaker is. The agenda power is held by another executive committee elected by the broad membership.  About half the states allow recall, usually around 20% or so of those residing in a district get to sign petitions if they wish to recall a member, if the threshold is reached in the time period they hold a special vote and a majority can recall their legislator, usually replaced in a special election.   States like California have changed to a very different redistricting method. In California, they get applications from those wanting to be on the commission, the elected state auditor sorts them into three pools, 60 candidates from the two largest parties and 60 from neither party, the leaders of the parties in each house get to strike enough so that 12 are left from each pool, and the auditor drew 3 from each main party and 2 from the independents, and the 8 chosen that way choose a further 6 candidates from those who didn´t get chosen earlier. They have to make maps with criteria of non partisanship, neither favour nor disfavour to the incumbent or any party or candidate, and compactness and community, and those on the commission have a ban for a period of time of being tied to politicians or parties or being lobbyists.  And in Alaska, in the primary election, anyone can run regardless of party, each voter gets to choose one candidate, and the four with the most votes go to the general election and voters rank the four there and if nobody has a majority, eliminate the least voted candidate and transfer votes from the least placed candidate until a majority is attained for one candidate.   &#x200B;  There are a number of other ideas that states have used to improve their elections and legislatures.
What would happen if a few Republicans decided to vote for Democrat Hakeem Jeffries as preferable to the deadlocked Republican party? Jeffries has 212 votes and is considered a moderate.  As implausible as it is, six Republicans might do the unthinkable and vote for him next ballot.  If they do, what would Congress look like?  How would work get done?  Could it?
What would happen if Kevin McCarthy's decided to chase after 19 moderate Democrats to vote for him? Kevin McCarthy is struggling to unite his caucus to vote for him as speaker. What would be the political implications if McCarthy decided to do a 180 and repudiate the Trump wing by asking 19 Democrats to vote for him in exchange for more moderate positions during his tenure? Would the other Republicans still vote for him. How do you think that would play for voters? For for anyone who is more familiar with McCarthy's intentions, is this even a realistic possibility?
Could America's city planning play a part in its extreme political polarization? Outside of cities developed largely before WWII, most of America's city design philosophy is based upon single-use, segregated land use. Residential areas are very far from commercial areas which are very far from communal areas, and the only way between all of these places is with a personal vehicle. Additionally, single family housing with lawns and a fence is the norm here where you rarely need to interact with your neighbors. Basically we've designed our cities to promote social isolation and discourage spontaneous interaction.  *The "Third place" is a term coined by sociologist* [*Ray Oldenburg*](http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2014/04/13/the-pros-and-cons-of-gentrification/every-community-deserves-a-third-place) *and refers to places where people spend time between home (‘first’ place) and work (‘second’ place). They are locations where we exchange ideas, have a good time, and build relationships.* American cities (Post WWII) severely lack these "third places," they definitely exist but for most of us they are places we have to go out of our way to drive to, where as in cities designed around walking and public transportation these communal spaces form naturally around residential and commercial areas.  These are the places where ideas are exchanged, where we get to know our neighbors and the community around us, where a middle class person can bond with a rich or a poor person, black with a white person, and where conservatives and progressives can try to understand each other's  views, so could America's lack of places like this be part of the reason it is so politically polarized?  (Fun fact: the shopping mall was invented to recreate a third place for American suburbia).
What makes Pro-Choice people vote Republican? Obviously the GOP is against abortion and other reproductive healthcare, but some people who are Pro-Choice identify as Conservatives/Republicans and will vote for Republican candidates that are anti-abortion. Why? What stance(s) do Democrats have that will cause Pro-Choice people to lean Conservative?
What viable, legal way forward do American conservatives have? Some assumptions that this question is operating under:  1. Conservatives need every single vote that they can get.  2. Religious extremism, whether this is a loud minority or a substantial group, are pulling the GOP further to the right and towards authoritarian means.  3. This movement to the right is, in large numbers, annoying more central constituents of the GOP and, in much smaller numbers, pushing them to vote for liberal candidates.  4. The GOP cannot let up on certain culture issues due to needing to keep the, for lack of a better word, more passionate members of their party satisfied and voting.  5. If the GOP moves further to the left to reclaim some of the assumed lost votes, it may anger the further right constituents, they would still obviously vote for the furthest right option or stay home and not vote at all.
Is it too late for the U.S to start a nationwide major nuclear energy project? Nuclear energy is a form of energy that has support from all across the political spectrum. It is much more environmentally friendly than fossil fuels, avoids the massive amount of lithium mining (although there would still be uranium mining), and works regardless of weather. The downsides are the time and public opinion to plan and build nuclear power plants as well as the toxic waste.   The IRA provided some funds to nuclear but those were mostly for maintaining existing nuclear plants. A major investment into new modern nuclear power plants across the nation could be a huge boon and path towards both what republicans call "energy independence" as well as climate goals from the democrats.   However, with renewables like wind and solar growing rapidly, is it too late to do major investments into nuclear?
Could Kevin McCarthy's struggle for the speakership be a sign of a lackluster GOP majority to come in the 118th Congress? If Kevin McCarthy does not win the speakership on the 1st vote, it'd be the 1st time since 1923 & only the 2nd time since The Civil War. The Republican Party holds the majority in the House of Representatives, however, because of a disappointing performance in the 2022 midterms, the GOP only possesses the majority by 5 seats. This gives unexpected leverage to hard-line conservatives in the party, particularly members of the House Freedom Caucus. Members of this caucus are the primary reason for McCarthy's challenging Speaker bid. It begs the question, is this lack of unity within the party a sign of things to come in regards to the GOP's legislative agenda? Will the party struggle to present as a united legislating force to the American people?
Does a moderate republican have a shot? Are the Kasich Republicans complete outcasts? Does the nominee have to be MAGA backed or in that light?  It would seem to me to get the independent vote to break in Republicans favor a more center right candidate would be beneficial if they could get out if the primaries alive?  Looking to hear some thoughts?
why isn't the crack cocaine epidemic talked about more in modern American politics ? The crack epidemic was as a surge of crack cocaine use in major cities across the United States throughout the entirety of the 1980s and the early 1990s. This resulted in a number of social consequences, such as increasing crime and violence in American inner city neighborhoods, a resulting backlash in the form of tough on crime policies, and a massive spike in incarceration rates.  This is important part of black history and is widely considered to be the source or contributing factor of many problems in the black community today such as drug abuse,single parent homes and gang violence. An example of this as per wikipedia a 2018 study found that the crack epidemic had long-run consequences for crime, contributing to the doubling of the murder rate of young Black males soon after the start of the epidemic, and that the murder rate was still 70 percent higher 17 years after crack's arrival. The paper estimated that eight percent of the murders in 2000 are due to the long-run effects of the emergence of crack markets, and that the elevated murder rates for young Black males can explain a significant part of the gap in life expectancy between black and white males.  There is also the controversial crack and powder cocaine 100 to 1 sentencing law which disproportionately affected African Americans and is no doubt responsible for the rise In incarceration during that time. Futhermore its origins are also a mystery with many believing it was caused by US foreign policy in Latin America  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crack_epidemic_in _the_United_States
Why don’t moderate Republicans and Democrats form a coalition in the House? With all the controversy over McCarthy and far right Republicans refusing to back him; yet he’s trying to cater to them.  Why don’t moderate Republicans and Democrats come together, form a coalition and decide on a moderate Republican candidate for Speaker who will completely cut the far right out of all discussions? Someone both could agree on, and reach a majority of votes for Speaker?
What is stopping Democrats from Creating a "Public Option Assistance" Program on a State-by-State Basis? (Plan Description Below)  As we've seen, the GOP will shoot down any plan by the Democrats have for a Federal Public Option. The reason is two-fold:  1. Partisanship  2. Belief in "small government"   So, what I was thinking about was the following...what if The Democrats proposed an idea wherein the Federal Government will work with State Govts that **do want** to implement a **state-level** public option?  Example:   1. Assume Pennsylvania State Legislature Votes to Implement Public Option  2. They Reach out to the Federal Government for some Funding Assistance  3. Feds give money and some "mentorship" on how to set up a public option   What is stopping the implementation of such a plan by The Democrats, especially when this would circumvent the issues of a potentially non-compliant or uncooperative GOP?
Is there a position that the party you oppose has that you agree with? In our highly partisan age it can be difficult to come together on anything. In the spirit of this new year think of a party position that you are willing to reach across the aisle and agree on. Happy New Year!
What are the most fundamental distinctions in laws between China and modern Western nations? One of the most as Fukuyama notes is "Rule BY Law" as opposed to rule of law in the west, where even kings and Presidents are formally bound by the same laws as ordinary people. Xi's ability to bend Chinese law to his desired outcome has a 2,000 year history beginning with the Qin dynasty, where the emperor was not under heaven but WAS heaven itself.   A second distinction is in property law, which doesn't exist in China, which is one reason why intellectual property laws are virtually meaningless and where hutongs can be forcibly relocated if the government sees fit to install a new freeway.   What other ways are laws distinct? Bonus points if you can describe their origin as well.
How important is "popular opinion" in fomenting a revolution? I'm starting from the premise that society (individuals + relations between them) is the product of the system, molded by it to a very large extent, in line with Marx's analysis and Gramsci's expansions on cultural hegemony. This is also what we see happened in revolutions such as the Bolshevik revolution or the Cuban revolution, with Lenin and Castro starting out with a very small number of revolutionaries and benefiting from a preexisting system breakdown to impose an alternative.  Given the above, how important is "popular opinion" in fomenting a revolution? To what extent should a revolutionary party work to affect popular opinion? And what aspects of recruitment do you think take precedence? I'm really interested in reading more about this, so if you've got any articles or studies, please do send them my way.
Donald Trump shared an article calling on him to abandon the Republican Party if Republicans do not back him for presidential nomination in 2024. By re-posting the article, is Trump saying he is willing to actually run as a 3rd Party candidate or is this just attention seeking? Trump made sure his influence was felt during the 2022 midterms, but after Republicans failed to secure a “red wave,” some members of his party have blamed him for the GOP’s poor showing.  He must now grapple with polls like [CNN’s from earlier this month](https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/14/politics/biden-trump-2024-poll/index.html), which showed that most Republicans and Republican-leaning independents want the party to nominate someone other than Trump in 2024. Their top pick for an alternative? Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. The GOP governor, who won a resounding reelection last month, enjoyed much stronger favorability ratings than Trump among Republicans, according to the CNN survey.  With Trump, it is always difficult to predict what he might do next, or when he is serious and when he is not. Is there a chance that if Trump for some reason does not get a nomination that he may actually decide to run as a third-party candidate?   [https://www.newsweek.com/trump-posts-article-urging-him-ditch-gop-run-third-party-candidate-1770560](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-posts-article-urging-him-ditch-gop-run-third-party-candidate-1770560)
When did "conservative" become a synonym for "right-wing" or has it always been this way? I'm talking about America specifically. I am not American and know very little about it's history, which is why I am asking this question here.  The same question can be asked of progressive being a synonym for "left-wing", although left-wing is a bit broader than just being progressive.   Being conservative doesn't have to be the same as being right-wing. In a situation where a left-wing government is changing to a right-wing one, conservative would probably be associated with left-wing (and progressive would be associated with right-wing).
Will the scheduling review of marijuana end in its rescheduling, descheduling, or the status quo? **Rescheduling:** Marijuana is treated more like prescription medicine. This could endanger the current recreational model if it's more seriously enforced.  **Descheduling:** Marijuana is removed from the Controlled Substances Act and federally legalized, making it on par with alcohol or tobacco.   **Status Quo:** Marijuana is kept Schedule I, no change from current status.  Which is the most likely outcome? Last time it was reviewed (2011-2016), status quo was the outcome. Since then, however, marijuana laws have only become more liberal on a state-by-state basis, with 21 states now allowing recreational use (technically 20 atm since Maryland's goes into effect on the 1st of July). Will this result in a different outcome this time?
Future of politics in Europe Hey, it looks like there has been a political shift in Europe. From being very open and "lefty" it has turned into a righty enviorment. For example in my country of Sweden our far right party, the Sweden Democrats is now a support party for the right wing government. From having 0.22% of the votes in 1998 to 5.7% in 2010 and now 2022 having 20.5% of the votes so they are the 2nd biggest party in Sweden. Up until maybe 2018 it was taboo to vote for them and they were labeled (and are still labeled) as nazis.   And it feels like it happens in other countries as well, Italy, France, Germany. What do you think will happing in the following maybe 20 years? Do you think we will see even more extreme parties will start getting popular? With the pandemic still going, a recession and so on?
Why isn't common the return of former presidents and presidential candidates to politics ? Hello folks, i'm not from US therefore i'm a bit new to us politics.   Why can't Jeb Bush, Bush jr, Obama, Kerry, Al Gore and the Clintons, return to politics ?  I mean, they have great visibility, respect, experience.  They can run for senate, the house or even a state government.   Nevertheless they can also be secretaries in a government.
Would/Should Ukraine consider destroying the Port of Sevastopol as a denial action. What would be the consequences of this if they were to do so? Considering a part of the Crimean War and later the Russian invasion of the rest of Ukraine was driven by Russia wanting to secure warm water ports, what would happen if Ukraine denied them use of the major port they do have? It’s no secret that reconstruction would at best be difficult if not impossible with the supply shortages and logistical issues, along with the question of whether or not they have the knowledge to do so. I’m not saying this is ideal by any means, but I’m curious about how it would effect the war in both the short and long term.
With today's culture wars now including the framing of "Parent's Rights", how much control *should* a parent have over their underaged child's life? I should say at the top that I'm mostly interested to hear the thoughts of actual parents in this, as I am not one yet. I think this matter is a case where parents have the most to add to the conversation as it touches on their lives and values, but their views of it also need to be weighed as being too close to the issue and biased. Parents want to protect their kids, but how much protection is too much?  Anyway, one part of the modern culture wars that I feel like hasn't garnered a lot of discussion in the wake of the various "anti-woke"/"Don't Say Gay" bills over the last two years has been the expectation that the parent's role in the child's life has become more all-encompassing than it was a generation or two ago. In the last year, we've seen bills described as "Parent's Rights" bills [sweeping the country](https://www.future-ed.org/legislative-tracker-parent-rights-bills-in-the-states/), empowering parents to monitor the curriculum, reading materials, and interactions with staff that their children are experiencing at school and empowering them to raise objections to material they disagree with that are backed with legal weight. This has mostly been in the context of schools teaching material that the Right has objected to, framed as "Critical Race Theory" or the teaching of "sexually explicit material" to children. This issue was a major part of the VA governor's race in 2021, such that Terry McAuliffe's infamous gaffe, [“I don’t think parents should be telling schools what they should teach”](https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/578885-education-blunder-igniting-suburban-parents-driving-mcauliffe-panic-in/), may have been the final nail in the coffin on his campaign. Likewise, [this year has seen a major rise in "parent's rights" groups pushing for book bans to be enacted in schools, particularly on works with a focus on race or sexuality](https://pen.org/report/banned-usa-growing-movement-to-censor-books-in-schools/), limiting the ability of students to exercise autonomy in educating themselves on topics their parents may disapprove of. So where should we draw the line on where the authority of a parent to raise their children in a manner they see fit ends?  These bills also empower parents to be informed on changes to their students lives in school without the approval of the student. To quote [the Florida Parental Rights in Education Act](https://flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2022/1557/BillText/er/PDF):  >In accordance with the rights of parents enumerated in ss. 1002.20 and 1014.04, adopt procedures for notifying a student's parent if there is a change in the student's services or monitoring related to the student's mental, emotional, or physical health or well-being and the school's ability to provide a safe and supportive learning environment for the student. The procedures must reinforce the fundamental right of parents to make decisions regarding the upbringing and control of their children by requiring school district personnel to encourage a student to discuss issues relating to his or her well-being with his or her parent or to facilitate discussion of the issue with the parent. The procedures may not prohibit parents from accessing any of their student's education and health records created, maintained, or used by the school district, as required by s. 1002.22(2).   This is often cited by critics as *requiring* teachers to out LGBT students that may have confided in them to their parents, though particularly with regards to trans students using a different name and gender than they were enrolled under. Because the bill also empowers parents to threaten schools with legal action if staff members refuse to comply, then the students can no longer trust teachers or counselors to be adult confidants they can turn to outside of their family, cutting off an arm of social support that students have had access to in the past. How much should a parent be able to know about their children versus how much privacy and autonomy should a child be able to have?  And this isn't just limited to schools, the medical rights of children are also largely left in the hands of parents to decide. This isn't particularly new, [there have been multiple cases of children dying preventable deaths of illnesses that could have been treated if not for the religious objections of the parents](http://childrenshealthcare.org/?page_id=132) for over a century, from Christian Science to Jehovah's Witnesses to Orthodox Judaism. [43 states have laws protecting parents from neglect charges in those situations](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/parents-beliefs-about-medicine-child-abuse#State-laws-vary-on-religious-exemptions). But as anti-vaccine sentiment has become more widespread, [especially in the wake of the post-pandemic culture wars](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/12/26/vaccine-hesitancy-measles-chickenpox-polio-flu/), we've seen [tragic resurfacing of illnesses like polio and measles](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/29/polio-us-vaccines-new-york-rockland-county), where the children of parents who hold anti-vax views have their health put in risk with no say in the matter. [In most of the country, minors are not able to consent to vaccination without the approval of their parents](https://theconversation.com/do-us-teens-have-the-right-to-be-vaccinated-against-their-parents-will-it-depends-on-where-they-live-166147). This year has also seen stories of trangender teenagers seeking access to, or information about, puberty blockers or hormone treatments without their parents' knowledge through social media, [raising alarm among conservative parents](https://nypost.com/2021/06/09/lunatic-laws-let-gender-radicals-deny-all-parental-rights/). Similarly, while the last decade has seen significant progress to [have conversion therapy for minors labeled as child abuse and banned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._jurisdictions_banning_conversion_therapy), it still remains legal in half of the country. In all of those cases, the parents aren't the ones who have to live with the consequence of the decisions they make on behalf of their child, the child is. So how much should _their_ opinions weigh in on what they want to have done with their health and their bodies?  "[Think of the children](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3D8670smTI)" action is [nothing new](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scopes_trial), but the new framing of the issue has in some ways moved away from "protecting children" and more around "parents' rights", and that raises the question for me of how far those rights _should_ extend. No one likes the idea of the government telling families how to raise their kids because parents are, ostensibly, acting in what they consider to be the best interests of their children, and no way to raise a child is one-size-fits-all. You can even make good faith arguments to Left-leaning parents that these expansions of parental rights _can_ be used to monitor their children and allow for interventions to protect their kids if they show signs of self-harm, or radicalization, or sexual exploitation, which makes the argument of expanded parental rights appealing to them too. Yet as parental oversight has expanded since the days of "Stranger Danger" and away from the free-range ([sometimes _actually dangerous_](https://www.generations.com/insights/gen-x-on-the-edge-surviving-childhood)) childhoods of older Millennials and Gen Xers, we're seeing [concerning rates of mental health issues](https://healthmatch.io/blog/the-gen-z-mental-health-wave-what-is-causing-the-surge) among Gen Z that may be tied to [growing up in environments dominated by helicopter parents and limited in personal autonomy that weakens their emotional resiliency](https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/60624/young-adults-are-struggling-with-their-mental-health-is-more-childhood-independence-the-answer). So where do we draw the lines on where a parent's control over their child ends and a child becomes an autonomous person with their own rights? How do we as a culture get parents to build trust with their children and relax control over their lives? Is that something we even should be doing, or should parents be able to shape their child's life around their personal beliefs? Is this something that the government should even be legislating, either more rights to parents or more freedoms to children?
Regarding billions going to Ukraine So due to the war in Ukraine of course the US has been donating a few billions dollars to Ukraine to assist them defending themselves,multiple politics have spoke against this saying things such as” why isn’t that money going to fixing our own country?” Which that’s a good question, why wasn’t it? Because as far as I know we had all that money before the war in Ukraine began, so if they’re complaining about that now, then why wasn’t it ever going towards our country in the first place? This isn’t against any side, just something I thought I’d point out
Are voters rational? I suspect most are but I am disappointed in the often prominent emphasis on candidates' personality characteristics and mannerisms rather than on their enacted and/or proposed policy positions or their respective party's proposed policy positions. This was particularly true concerning former President Trump and of current relevance since he’s announced his 2024 candidacy.  I understand that many would argue that former President Trump, as others before him such as LBJ, Andrew Jackson, Teddy Roosevelt, John Adams and his son, often presented as "unpresidential" and disagreeable with the electorate and/or peers. Is the often vociferous and seemingly ubiquitous condemnation of such behavior from much of the electorate and media irrational? Or, perhaps, calculated?  Are voters truly \*more\* concerned with optics, charisma and sound bites than performance? Should voters rationally consider emphasizing deeds over words and party over personality when casting their votes?  Is it fair to suggest that voting for the candidate representing the political party whose positions you most align with would be the most likely candidate, if victorious, to enact policy you most align with? And to do so is in your best interests, regardless of the candidate's personality shortcomings?  In all earnestness, I ask, do too many voters, perhaps enough to swing an election, vote irrationally?
Do you agree with Malcolm X's analysis of violence and social justice? Malcolm is of course the famous and controversial black nationalist and black power leader of the 60s during the civil rights movement. Malcolm, unlike Dr King, his famous for his advocacy of armed self defense. His views on violence and armed revolution though take place in the context of analysing power dynamics, and also in the context of his views of social justice, which is are controversial. Here are quotes:  "***I would like to make a few comments concerning the difference between the black revolution and the Negro revolution. There’s a difference. Are they both the same? And if they’re not, what is the difference? What is the difference between a black revolution and a Negro revolution? First, what is a revolution? Sometimes I’m inclined to believe that many of our people are using this word “revolution” loosely, without taking careful consideration \[of\] what this word actually means, and what its historic characteristics are......Look at the American Revolution in 1776. That revolution was for what? For land. Why did they want land? Independence. How was it carried out? Bloodshed. Number one, it was based on land, the basis of independence. And the only way they could get it was bloodshed. The French Revolution — what was it based on? The land-less against the landlord. What was it for? Land. How did they get it? Bloodshed. Was no love lost; was no compromise; was no negotiation. I’m telling you, you don’t know what a revolution is. ‘Cause when you find out what it is, you’ll get back in the alley; you’ll get out of the way. The Russian Revolution — what was it based on? Land. The land-less against the landlord. How did they bring it about? Bloodshed. You haven’t got a revolution that doesn’t involve bloodshed. And you’re afraid to bleed. I said, you’re afraid to bleed***."(Message to the Grassroots, 1963)  "***\[As\] long as the white man sent you to Korea, you bled. He sent you to Germany, you bled. He sent you to the South Pacific to fight the Japanese, you bled. You bleed for white people. But when it comes time to seeing your own churches being bombed and little black girls be murdered, you haven’t got no blood. You bleed when the white man says bleed; you bite when the white man says bite; and you bark when the white man says bark. I hate to say this about us, but it’s true. How are you going to be nonviolent in Mississippi, as violent as you were in Korea? How can you justify being nonviolent in Mississippi and Alabama, when your churches are being bombed, and your little girls are being murdered, and at the same time you’re going to violent with Hitler, and Tojo, and somebody else that you don’t even know?***"(Message to the Grassroots, 1963)  "***If violence is wrong in America, violence is wrong abroad. If it’s wrong to be violent defending black women and black children and black babies and black men, then it’s wrong for America to draft us and make us violent abroad in defense of her. And if it is right for America to draft us, and teach us how to be violent in defense of her, then it is right for you and me to do whatever is necessary to defend our own people right here in this country***."(Message to the Grassroots, 1963)  "***A revolution is bloody, but America is in a unique position. She's the only country in history, in the position actually to become involved in a bloodless revolution. The Russian Revolution was bloody, Chinese Revolution was bloody, French Revolution was bloody, Cuban Revolution was bloody. And there was nothing more bloody than the American Revolution. But today, this country can become involved in a revolution that won't take bloodshed. All she's got to do is give the black man in this country everything that's due him, everything...I hope that the white man can see this. 'Cause if you don't see it you're finished***"(The Ballot or the Bullet, 1964)  “***Do nothing unto anyone that you would not like to have done unto yourself. Seek peace, and never be the aggressor—but if anyone attacks you, we do not teach you to turn the other cheek***.”(The Autobiography of Malcolm X)  "***If you stick a knife in my back nine inches and pull it out six inches, there's no progress. If you pull it all the way out that's not progress. Progress is healing the wound that the blow made. And they haven't even pulled the knife out much less heal the wound.***"(The Autobiography of Malcolm X)
How should the US House and the voters of NY’s 3rd District handle the revelations that George Santos fabricated a significant amount of his background? George Santos, Republican congressman-elect to the US House of Representatives has recently come under criticism for fabricating large amounts of his past, including claims about Jewish heritage, working for Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, and holding degrees from Baruch College and NYU.  To see a full list of inaccurate or fabricated background visit his Wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Santos  How should the US house handle these revelations?   How will this affects McCarthy’s speakership bid considering Santos promised to support him and McCarthy needs every vote he can get to fend off a flank from the right?  Should voters in his district request investigations or their punitive measures?
Where does Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez fit in the 2024 presidential elections? The Democratic socialist member of congress Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez does not say « no » when asked if she would consider a run for Presidential elections in The Late Show. In the same time, Bernie Sanders - her political mentor, will turn 83 in 2024. Will he try a 3rd time to bring the Democratic investiture ? Will AOC take over ? What about the fear of a Trump threat on American democracy can influence her position in favour of a united Democratic Party ?
How do European countries prevent wealth flight and other related issues despite much higher taxes, compared to the US? Speaking from an American perspective, it seems higher taxes are very unpopular here to the point where it's basically political suicide for someone to mention tax hikes during a campaign, even as a Democrat. It's a bit ironic because everyone wants to have a nice social safety net...but also nobody wants to pay for it. The poorest who would probably appreciate it don't have the money to finance such a net, and the wealthiest just run away when they have to pay more.   Is there any way to convince the wealthy that their tax money is being put to good use and convince them to stay in the State in which they reside?   It seems overall that upper income earners in Europe, Canada, and Australia despise higher taxes to a much lesser extent than the wealthy in the United States. Is it an ethos problem which is ultimately irreparable? If not, what's the work around?
Is there a solid argument to be made that the Syrian Civil War has been the most devastating and significant war of the 21st century? Yes, it’s basically been a frozen conflict for a couple of years now, and thus, has been overshadowed in recent years by other important developments(COVID, Russia-Ukraine conflict, China) but I’ve always found it to be one of the most complex and fascinating wars of all time.
Will the GOP investigations into Hunter Biden laptop story pan out to anything? Considering Joe Biden has said he knew nothing about Hunter Biden's business dealings overseas, if that proof is discovered, will the power of the presidency protect him or will the Democratic party throw him under the bus?
Why does the US have a murder rate 5 to 10 times higher than other western nations? The murder rate across all western nations minus the US is between 0.5 and 1.5 per 100k. In the US however it has been between 5 and 7 per 100k over the last 20 years. Its peak was in 1980 at 10 murders per 100k.
What choice would work better for Desantis? Momentum or distance? RD is favoured by most Rs for the nomination after a strong reflection, but this would pit him against DT, who controls enough of the base to decide an election.  Or would it be better for him to wait 4 years and run 'as his own man'?  I see so many posts about RD vs DT as if Desantis  is somehow obliged to declare his candidacy even though he is (relatively) young and could campaign on two full terms as governor and avoid the quagmire of the Trump/republican faceoff.  TBC. Not american, don't have skin in the game, I've just not seen anyone discuss the option of Desantis not running in  2024 at all
What has prevented Pakistan from developing as strongly as Israel, though they both were set up as sanctuaries for people of a given religion? Israel was created to establish sanctuary for Jews who were fleeing persecution or for a myriad of other reasons. Pakistan was formed officially in 1947, after independence, but the issue did center around lack of Muslim representation in the Indian government, and a concern for the potential disenfranchisement of the Muslim population in India after independence. This fear was supported by the Muslim League which at the time was led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah.   So...where did the two countries diverge that has left one still as a developing nation, while the other has progressed much further politically, technologically? What has hampered Pakistan's development?
What are the odds a national voting rights act gets through Congress while Biden’s office? I acknowledge that this may be a pie-in-the-sky premise at the national level, but I read that it will be a push for Dems in swing states where they flipped/maintained control of state legislatures or broke the Republican supermajority and/or hold governorship.   At a national level, several unresolved political dynamics at play.. chaos within House Republicans over Speaker; tension between House and Senate Republicans; schism from the ultra-right MAGA faction and the more moderate wing; Trump’s potential indictments; etc.   I guess my question is to the extent that it’s a possibility, what scenario(s) would need to play out to create a political environment where there may be enough Republican support for Democrats initiative to pass comprehensive national voting rights act before the next election?
How many states have sore loser laws that would prevent one from being on the ballot for president after losing a nomination bid? I’m asking this because there has been a lot of speculation about the possibility of Trump splitting the GOP vote if he loses the nomination.  But can Trump really DO that? And if so, then where?   I’ve seen some conflicting information about this type of scenario, such as with Ballotpedia, which states that only South Dakota and Texas have sore loser laws that relate to the presidency, while Wikipedia showed an example of Michigan not allowing Gary Johnson to appear on the ballot due to their law (although he did eventually become a write in candidate in the state).  Then there is this link (https://www.cnn.com/2015/08/13/politics/trump-third-party-run-barriers/) which states that only 5 states enforce these laws. So what is going on here?
Do you agree with John Mearsheimer's complex view of the Ukraine war as well as his view that China is a bigger threat than Russia? John Mearsheimer is one of the leading intellectuals in the school of realist thought which take a largely realpolitik view of the world. He has been a critic of Western foreign policy whether on the issue of N.A.T.O, the Israel Palestine, etc. As a result the ordinary person taking a surface level view of his thought might see him as being "anti american" or "anti western" in his view of international relations. But there are significant nuances to his thought that are interconnected and that don't fit neatly on the political spectrum. Specifically the connection between his views on Ukraine, Russia and China. Let me break it down.  **Ukraine War:**  * Mearsheimer has been one of the largest critics of the West's foreign policy to Russia on the Ukraine issue. Specifically the issue of N.A.T.O enlargement and Ukraine's possible ascension into N.A.T.O. He sees it if you will as poking the Russian bear and an unnecessary form of Western imperialism. In his view the same way how America has the Monroe Doctrine, Russia has its own version of the Monroe Doctrine, seeing Russia's actions as evidence of this. Furthermore, precisely because Russia and the West collectively are nuclear powers, he see a danger in the current conflict as escalating in a potential nuclear one. * At this point there are many who dismiss Mearsheimer's views here as just being "pro Russia" or "repeating Russian talking points". But is far more complex than this. Because Mearsheimer also believes Ukraine should not have given up its Nuclear Weapons stockpile. In 1994 when the Budapest Memorandum was signed he was a dissenting voice in international theory. He stated that by denuclearising it opened Ukraine up to the possibility of a Russian invasion. His view was dismissed interestingly in both Western and even Ukrainian circles who at the time said the possibility of a Russian invasion was low. Essentially from Mearsheimer's perspective, Ukraine retaining its nuclear capability would have been a more effective deterrent compared to ascension into N.A.T.O.  **Russia and China**  * As you can gather Mearsheimer is a major critic of what he sees as antagonising Russia. Namely because he sees the Russian Federation as different from the Soviet Union which he believes was a major threat to Western interests. The Russian Federation by contrast has in theory more interests in common with the West. Furthermore, and controversially he doesn't see Putin as a pro active imperialistic. He sees him as a reactive Irredentist, simply reacting to N.A.T.O expanding on the border of Russia the same way America reacted to Soviet troops and Missiles in Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis. * How does all of this tie to China? In Mearsheimer's view as mentioned, he sees China as actually being the bigger geopolitical threat. China has a much larger GDP than Russia, it is significantly expanding what he sees as its own imperialistic aims through things like the Belt and Road Initiative, as well as its military presence in the South Asia sea which he sees as a potential threat to Taiwan, as well as Western assets in the region. As a result he actually does support the Pivot to Asia. Connecting this to Eastern Europe, he believes that the U.S should not be spending its time and resources there, it should be concentrated on the Pivot to Asia. Furthermore he believes that by isolating Russia, it has pushed Russia further into the arms of China. What he believes is the West should have attempted a strategic partnership with Russia to contain China. So his major emphasis is Chinese containment.
Why has the quality of our political discussions decreased in recent years? Have we become worse listeners? Political discussion is supposed to be an exchange. In the pursuit of truth, we examine our positions in the context of others, to do this properly we must at least make an attempt to understand opposing arguments in good faith. It seems a higher and higher percentage of people only hear the weaknesses in opposing arguments and less and less effort is put forth to find common ground. Is this a product of technology? Culture?
Why did Gov. Kathy Hochul nominate a judge with conservative views, Lasalle, to the Court of Appeals? Would he be confirmed? Seeing how the conservative majority in the court struck down New York's congressional map last year, which may have been, what given Republicans the house majority, why did Hochul nominate a conservative?
Why isn't the Coalition in Australia not as far-right as the GOP in US, despite the pervasiveness of right-wing Murdoch media in both US and Australia? I recently learned that News Corps owns a significant majority of print and broadcast news media in Australia. In the US, they own Fox News and WSJ, which are both right-wing media. Obviously, I think it's natural to think that such a significant media present of News Corp will penetrate into the politics of each respective country, as we see with Fox News and the GOP.  But looking policies of both the Liberal-National Party and the GOP, the LNP (Coalition) seems much more "moderate" as a political party. Why is this? I would have expected the Coalition and its electorae to be as conservative as the GOP but it seems like it's not. What are some factors in the diverging political outcomes and policy platform for GOP and the Coalition in spite of both countries having a significant Murdoch media presence? For the sake of argument, let's confine this discussion to politics at the Federal level only, because I realize that once you include local politics, it gets a lot more complex.  Thanks!
Which Presidential election loss was more consequential? Al Gore losing the Presidency in 2000 or Hillary Clinton losing the Presidency in 2016? Both of these Elections were consequential. Both Al Gore and Hillary Clinton despite running after Democrats controlled Whitehouse for 8 years won the Popular vote but got screwed over by SCOTUS in 2000 and Comey in 2016. But I’m asking which election loss had more consequences for the world?
Why is it very common for politicians these days to win or lose only by a Tiny Margin unlike back in the past where they would win by a larger margin? For example, Kari Lake lost by less then 1% margin.  Hershel Walker lost by 2.8 percent margin.  Dr OZ lost by a 5 percent margin.  Trump Lost by 4.5 percent Margin.  Even Bolsonaro from Brazil lost by 1.8 percent margin.  Are there are anyone these days that actually win or lose by a much much larger margin, like around 20-70 percent margin?
In 2024 if DeSantis wins the republican nomination and Trump runs 3rd party, would you be open to someone running on a progressive 3rd party? Say 2024 comes around and DeSantis or some other Republican gets the nomination and Trump decides to run 3rd party splitting the Republican vote, would that be a good time for a progressive faction (Pro Universal Healthcare, pro extensive climate action, pro 15 dollar minimum wage, etc)to split off the neo-liberal faction of the Democratic party, if the Democrats keep doing half measures? Since the Republicans would already be split, there would be no risk of a spoiler effect.   Example ballot, but not necessarily the exact canadates Biden/ Harris (Democrat), DeSantis/ Cruz (Republican), Sanders/ Cortez (Progressive), Trump/Green (MAGA), West/ Fuentes (Yeezy)
US Nonpartisans: is there a fundamental difference in principles between either conservatives or progressives? To make plain: I am not interested in a moral debate here.  I am trying to look at it from a big picture.   Fundamentally both progressives and conservatives are liberal in the classical sense. Both operate via a classical liberal democratic set of rules. Again while not seeing a moral argument, both seek to expand rights in certain areas while closing them in others. While the Trump brand of supporters are authoritarian, the bulk of the parties consist of classical liberals.  So,  "who has better policies? Who had the moral high ground?" aside, does either side of the spectrum operate fundamentally differently? Again big picture,  not looking for policy differences.
Does Education largely determine political ideology? We know there are often exceptions to every rule. I am referring to overall global trends. As a rule,  Someone noted to me that the divide between rural and urban populations and their politics is not actually as stark as it may seem. The determinant of political ideology is correlated to education not population density. Is this correct?  Are correlates to wealth clear cut, generally speaking?  Edit for clarity: I'm not referring to people in power who will say and do anything to pander for votes. I'm talking about ordinary voters.
International PoliticsIf the USA had the best interest of the world at heart, and our own best interest, what would we do about the Ukraine war? The arguments I've heard about this were -- simplistic. This could be a place to look deeper.  Here are some background assumptions that I haven't noticed any dicsussion about:  The war will and should continue until one side wins.   Then the victors have the right to impose their will on the victims.   The USA has the moral obligation to decide which side is right and which side is wrong.   One side must be right, and the other wrong.   The USA has the moral obligation to spend enough money to make sure that the right side wins.
If Desantis wins in 2024 or 2028, will Republicans see the Senate as a political dead end? There have been only three sitting US Senators elected to the presidency: Warren G. Harding, John F. Kennedy and Barack Obama. All with in the last hundred years. While there have been 17 state governors elected overall and four came in the last 50 years. So it's safe to say that being a governor is a better stepping stone to the white house than being a senator is.  But the thing is Cruz and Rubio were described as rising stars in the Republican party and were expected to go very far in the 2016 primary. But Trump demolished them. Now it looks like Cruz is prepping for a second run but I can't help but think he would be in a better position if he were governor of Texas. That comes to my point. Should Desantis run and prevail in 2024 or 2028, will we see ambitious Republican senators make for the exit and go for governorships instead? Or use the senate as a means to attach themselves to a Republican administration like VP or Secretary of Defence and launch bids from those positions?
When it comes to the way genocide is discussed in history and international politics, are you are genocide maximalist or minimalist? The ongoing war in Ukraine got me thinking about this topic, and I'm a lay man and by no means an expert. However for those who don't know these terms they basically mean the following. Genocide minimalist have a by the book understanding of genocide. Namely the deliberate intent to destroy a group on the basis of race, national origin, religion, and ethnicity. Maximalist seek to expand the definition of genocide. They believe other categories should be added and they also do not believe that "deliberate" should be the only criteria for what constitutes a genocide. They also believe that state neglect should be added. So basically minimalists have a by the letter understanding of genocide that requires a very high standard of proof, because its the ultimate crime. Maximalist have a more flexible understanding of the term. Personally I am a genocide minimalist because I see how the term can be manipulated and abused by partisan actors and ideologues who have an agenda. These are two political examples of that happening:   **The Clinton Administration, Iraq and sanctions:**   During the Clinton years its well known that the U.S along with the U.N security council maintained a sanctions regime against Saddam's Iraq. It was alleged that these sanctions caused a humanitarian crisis which Unicef later reported caused the death of 500,000 children. Madeleine Albright would later get into hot when she infamously stated on the sanctions "the price is worth it". Years later the British Medical Journal revisited those statistics on the infant mortality rate in Iraq during the sanctions period and they found they were unreliable. Because Unicef, the Lancet and others were relying on data Saddam's regime was provide them. Saddam lied about the data so that he could have the sanctions lifted to try and restart his nuclear program. The U.N resolutions on the sanctions from the Bush Sr years prohibited the sale of oil for the purchase of weapons, but it allowed the sale for oil for food explicitly. Furthermore Iraq's oil revenues actually increased in the 90s. Groups like the Lancet and the British Medical Journal would reinterview the families of their surveys in the 90s and they got massively different results. So this is a clear example of the rhetoric of genocide being manipulated.   **Patrice Lumumba and Congolese independence and Civil War:**   Patrice Lumumba was the famous anti colonial leader of the Congo who lead it to independence from the Belgians. The Congo would later fall into civil war and just months into his leadership he was overthrown in a coup that was backed and organised by Belgium and the Eisenhower Administration at the time. What is less well known is that justifications for his overthrow included accusations of genocide. The Congo as mentioned fell into a civil, incited by Belgium. This included conflict between white settlers and Africans over Lumbumba's affirmative action policies as well as conflicts between the various ethnic groups of Africans and regional authorities with the central authorities. As a result, similar to what is happening now in Ukraine, Belgium encouraged two seccessionist movements in Kasai and Katanga. Their secession would have lead to the Congolese state collapsing. Lumumba asked for international assistance but America's veto in the U.N security council prevented this. Eventually Lumumba ended up sending the Congolese army in these regions to try and quell the secession. However because he was the leader of a newly independent state under civil war conditions he did not have full control of the army. As a result soldiers and field commanders ended up committing atrocities. Atrocities were committed by both the army and the secessionists through resulting a total casualty rate of 3000 civilians. However in the press and media only the atrocities of government troops were reported and it ended up being described by many, including the U.N secretary general as a case of "incipient genocide". This then became a pretext for the Belgium government and Eisenhower Administration to organise a coup. Years later many scholars would conclude Lumbumba had no genocidal intent whatsoever in his running of the Congo.   Its because of examples from political history like this why i tend to be a genocide minimalist when analysing accusations of genocide in international relations. It is a term that is abused and exploited too often. To me the threshold of evidence to prove genocide has to be extremely high precisely because its such a serious crime.
What policy disagreements would Trump and DeSantis debate on in the Republican primary? Trump and DeSantis are the apparent front runners for the GOP nomination for the presidency. Within this process they will have to make their claim to the Republican electorate as to why they would be a better candidate than the other. With all that in mind, what actual policy differences would the two candidates have?
Is the U.S moving leftwards or rightwards? On one hand, we've seen the rise of socially right wing movements in Trumpism. On the other, we're seeing a widespread backlash to neoliberal capitalism that has resulted in the Biden administration pursuing progressive economic goals.  Part of me wonders whether we can see the future of the U.S in Ron Desantis. In favor of reigning in large corporations such as Disney, and at the same time carrying on the legacy of MAGA (but more streamlined).  This might mean the next "phase" of U.S history will mirror the New Deal era after the Great Depression. FDR had to compromise with southern conservatives in order to pass his pro-labor economic reforms. This meant no significant headway was made into civil rights until the 60's, when the new deal coalition fell apart.  Conversely, from the 1980s/1990s forward we've lived in a neoliberal economic framework where social liberalism along with deregulated free market Capitalism was the paradigm. Social conservatives were able to slow down the social gains being made since the 60s during the mid-70s/80s, but the establishment right had little success in reversing aforementioned social gains, and arguably stopped putting in much significant effort since at least the 90's. It was many conservatives dissatisfaction with that status quo which led to the rise of the alt-right and Trumpism, after which social conservatism has finally seen some success with the overturning of Roe V. Wade (among other successes)  For some this may signal that the U.S will continue to move in a socially conservative direction. However, others may argue that these conservative gains will be short lived (pointing to the popular backlash possibly seen in the 2022 midterms, for example), or that the progressive economic reforms being attempted by the Biden administration won't be successful and/or enough.   What do you think? Is the U.S moving rightwards? Leftwards? A mix of both along economic/social dimensions?
Will House Republicans continue supporting Ukraine? House Republicans have said they won't continue support for the Ukrainian war. Do you think they are serious about cutting funding or is this all talk?  "The far right of the GOP has long stirred opposition to the US' support for Ukraine, rallying around an isolationist "America First" foreign policy, and with some expressing admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin.  Greene could emerge with enhanced power in the wake of the midterms, as a prominent member of the party's MAGA wing. Rep. Kevin McCarthy, who is campaigning to be elected House Speaker, has echoed her criticisms of the US' Ukraine aid program, saying in October that under GOP control the House would not be offering a "blank check" in its support for Ukraine."  https://www.businessinsider.com/mtg-attacks-plans-for-ukraine-president-to-visit-congress-more-aid-2022-12  Thoughts?
Are there instances in the world where rural populations represent the liberal faction in politics while urban areas represent the progressive faction? In a very lively thread here we've been discussing why rural areas run conservative and why urban areas run progressive. However one commenter noted an instance (Bolivia) where roles are reversed. I'm curious to hear more about Bolivia and if there are other instances. This seems to be more of an exception to the rule, which is that rural is dominant conservative while urban is dominant progressive.
Who is using a better strategy to tackle inflation: The Federal Reserve or the European Central Bank? For reference:  -The Fed has been raising rates (from 0.25% start) since February of 2022, at a rate of .42 basis points/month. Currently, the rate is at 4.4%, an overall increase of 4.15%.  -The ECB has been raising rates (from 0% start) since September of 2022, at a rate of .83 basis points a month. Currently, the rate is at 2.5%, an overall increase of 2.5%.  -US inflation peaked this year at slightly over 9% in June, and has continued to decrease monthly, bottoming at 7.1% (forcasted) in December, a 0.1% increase from December of 2021.  -EU inflation peaked this year at 11.5% in October, after which decreasing to 11.1% in November. Overall, inflation has increased 5.9% since November of last year.   -The Euro is at its lowest value since the early 2000s compared to USD, and bottomed out in September at $0.96 USD. It has since rebounded slightly, but remains under its pre-2022 value.   https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/inflation-cpi  https://tradingeconomics.com/european-union/inflation-rate    https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/interest-rate  https://tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/interest-rate  https://tradingeconomics.com/eurusd:cur
Free Speech and Capitalism The 1st amendment, properly understood, prevents the STATE from infringing upon free speech.  In a classical liberal STATE, does the population and culture have to follow this principle?     If capitalism is a market condition that relies upon laissez faire economics, is it possible for a STATE to allow free speech and at the same time regulate the market?
Is it possible that Donald Trump was slow-rolling his 2024 presidential bid in case the Jan 6th commission suggested charges against him? There isn't a lot of sense in spending X millions of dollars if you know there is a chance that you might be barred from serving in Federal service. There was a lot of chatter on various news stations about the former president showing an underwhelming amount of advertising and spending on his 2024 presidential bid - it could be that they suspected that the commission might recommend charges that would cause issues.  In addition, what are the chances that the Dept of Justice will actually move forward with actual charges, and if so - will they stick?
Why are rural areas more conservative that cities? I'm inspired by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/zpemo7/why_are_rural_areas_more_conservative/) in /r/nostupidquestions. In it, top commenter remarked something novel to me, which is that how we relate to the same general issue is so different, and this is a factor in the divide. Rural area populations generally cannot relate to city populations, and vice versa. Guns have a different relationship among the two; gas prices have a different relationship, etc. Gun possession, for instance, are a way of life for rural folks that do not have the same consequences for cities dealing with significant gun violence.   My understanding of the conservative strength of rural communities is as follows, and I want to hear from others.   Identity politics play a strong role in rural populations which have consistently dwindled as younger generations leave for the cities and into a completely different way of life, threatening these communities' survival. With slower rates of communal change, identities are far more cohesive and tight-knit. Economically, these communities are also at a disadvantage creating further impoverishment. Mussolini effectively electrified the rural populations of Italy for these same reasons, while including Xenophobia as another factor for motivation. In case someone misses my nuance, Conservatism and fascism are not the same thing.  What is the current consensus on the general causes of the geographic polarization of rural vs city populations?
Which type of morality should have more weight in society, religious or social morality?  Recently, a teacher in Ohio was asked to resign because she (quote) "refused" to address students by their preferred names and gender identities. Following her resignation, she filed a lawsuit against the school district for violating her first amendment right to religious freedom. According to the news article, the issue boils down to the teacher believing "Rejection of one's biological sex is a rejection of the image of God within that person," and that using preferred pronouns/gender identity is "immoral." This case is a complex issue between religion and politics, wherein two parties are facing a divide between social morality and religious morality. On one hand, a person should be free to practice their own religious beliefs, no matter how unpopular/unusual/etc they may be, and on the other, people should be allowed to be comfortable in their own identities no matter how unpopular/unusual/etc they may be. This case will be tough to argue in court on both sides. So I ask you all, which morality do you feel has more pull in this case?
Jan 6, Panel made its criminal referral to DOJ against Trump. DOJ now has access to all the information that the Panel discovered and any leads. Is DOJ likely to find useful information and how that may impact its decision on whether to pursue charges against Trump, if any? DOJ, which is already pursuing a criminal probe of Trump’s Jan. 6-related actions, is not required to consider referrals from Congress, which have no legal weight.  Hence symbolic; DOJ must act independently and decide on its own evaluation whether it has evidence to pursues any charges.  However, there is no prohibition against the DOJ to evaluate any evidence that the Panel may have uncovered. In the past \[June 2022\] DOJ even accused the Panel of a “failure” to share its 1,000 witness transcripts.  [Tensions escalate as DOJ renews request for Jan. 6 panel transcripts - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/06/16/tensions-escalate-as-doj-renews-request-for-jan-6-panel-transcripts-00040267)  The Committee referral to DOJ includes charges against Trump. Panel alleges Trump violated federal criminal statutes and committed the crimes of insurrection, obstruction of an official proceeding; conspiracy to defraud the federal government and making a false statement.  \[Specifically, the charges that subcommittee proposes for Trump: 18 U.S.C. 2383, insurrection; 18 U.S.C. 1512(c), Obstruction of an official proceeding; and 18 U.S.C. 371, Conspiracy to defraud the United States government and Conspiracy to Make a False Statement 18 U.S.C. 371, 1001\]  As noted, the Justice Department has pursued its own investigation regarding the January 6, event and it may, if it so wishes, make an independent evaluation of the evidence discovered by the Panel.  Is DOJ likely to find useful information and how that may impact its decision on whether to pursue charges against Trump, if any?
What do people think about immigration reform acts like the EAGLE act? What do people think about “documented dreamers”? I’m curious on how people view legal immigration. A lot of the times when legal immigration is talked about, a discussion about illegal immigration always follows, leaving the discussion about legal immigration in dust. Documented Dreamers is a term that refers to children brought to the US by their temporary workers parents; those children are brought here around 5 years old and they are educated and raised here. The only caveat is that they are in risk of self deportation if they reach the age of 21 without a green card. I hope we all can have a civil discussion about this!
Graft and the targeted industries for autocracies to influence and corrupt democracies: The article "The Rise of Strategic Corruption" from Foreign Affairs (July/Aug 2020 edition) states, "In recent years, a number of countries—China and Russia, in particular—have found ways to take the kind of corruption that was previously a mere feature of their own political systems and transform it into a weapon on the global stage ... key economic sector that presents opportunities for high-margin plunder—often banking, telecommunications, or natural resources such as oil and gas ... Owing to China’s history of conflict with the British Empire, China’s leaders are familiar with the way the British operated in the nineteenth century, and they seem to appreciate how the empire’s power did not rely solely on soldiers or warships; it came, rather, from the empire’s control of ports, canals, railroads, mines, shipping routes, telegraph cables, commercial standards, and financial exchanges".  The above notes telecommunications, natural resources, and means for trade (such as financial exchanges, banking, shipping routes, and infrastructure) as industries especially subject to foreign influence (including graft) and—relatedly—national defense concern. I'm interested to hear thoughts about a) current and future key industries of great concern, b) means for democracies to guard against autocratic economic interference, c) sensible shifts in economic policy (eg, protectionism vs free trade either in general or for specific industries like semiconductors, AI, and robotics?), and d) evolving military policy (eg, with the rise of China and its navy, should we increase investment in our navies?).
With the upcoming referral of criminal charges by the Jan 6 committee of Donald Trump and the appointment of Jack Smith, should we expect a criminal indictment of Donald Trump within the next 3-4 weeks to 1 month? Additionally, should civil unrest be expected after a potential indictment? After Trump’s 2024 announcement and the appointment of a special counsel, it seems like the investigation into Donald Trump is heating up. Additionally, with the removal of the special master in the Mar-a-Lago case, it makes it much easier for the DOJ and to collect evidence and get ready for an indictment. With these factors, I feel like an indictment could come fairly soon, with the 2024 election getting closer, the DOJ would want to charge as soon as possible, so that any potential case could be done  before the election. With this, how will Trump supporters react to his potential indictment. While after the midterms, some in the Republican Party have tired to move away from Trump, he still has some support in party and among his diehard supporters as well. These groups could start some sort of civil unrest due to anger over his indictment, which could lead to more potential consequences. These are just my personal thoughts and predictions, and I’d like to see what others have to think.
Who is the active politician with the best oratory skills in the US? After president Obama retired and president Trump popularized a more blunt approach to public speaking at least among Republicans, oratory seems to be on the decline in America, so who do you think are the best currently active orators in US politics?
What are the actual chances the Rubio bill to ban TikTok will go through? I know there's some other posts asking this but they also ask about agreeance to the bill in general, and that's what all the comments are.    I'm asking in terms of pure numbers and how politics in Washington is going right now, what are the chances that this bill is able to pass in both houses and become law? The security angle is obvious but it was as much so when previous similar bills failed, won't they be worried about alienating younger voters?
Policy import: What are some of the best policies from around the world which should be adopted elsewhere? What  are some of the best policies in your own country/other countries which  should be adopted elsewhere?  I found some smaller lists online but  most of the ideas focus on commercial ideas rather than policies which  can be implemented democratically.  So  if you know some really useful policies for e.g. labor laws, education,  healthcare etc. I would greatly appreciate your input :)
Would Maryland annexing most of D.C work as a compromise to give the people living in D.C representation? What is now D.C used to be entirely owned by Maryland. A major problem facing them is they can't vote for senators or representatives and many have called for statehood. Being politically realistic it's unlikely congress would vote for D.C to become a state anytime soon, but a way that might work is by having Maryland annex most of D.C expect for US government buildings. The people in D.C could vote for senators in Maryland as well as have their presidential votes count twords that state and would likely get a congressional district where they can choose a representative. There would be a much lesser if not no impact on the composition of congress and the people of D.C would get full representation. Would this work to settle the D.C statehood stalemate?
What would the response be if Putin decided to use a nuclear weapon? Recently Vladimir Putin (Russia) expressed consideration toward the use of nuclear weapons. Some believe he is bluffing while others don’t.   I am interested to see what others believe the response would from Russia itself as well as other countries across the world if he decided to take such action.   There are no right or wrongs, so please respect everyone’s point of view
Do you think Ron Desantis will call out Trump for losing the election when they finally have to debate in the primaries? Just saw an NBC News headline that read “Trump lashes out at polls showing Ron DeSantis with a big lead in the 2024 GOP primaries.” For some reason it made me imagine them at a primary debate and DeSantis basically changing narrative and saying that the election wasn’t stolen and that Trump lost and couldn’t handle and everyone has left Trump behind which is why you should ignore Trump and vote for DeSantis. It would be a bombshell attack for sure, but what do you think the damage would be for the GOP? More infighting? More people abandoning Trump since so many have no jumped the Trump ship finally? The GOP being split so hard that it costs them the general election regardless of who is put up?
Tensions are mounting between Serbia and Kosovo amid ethnic conflict. Serbia has also, steadily, been shifting away from its proclaimed EU membership goal and towards closer ties to Moscow. Could Putin be planning to open a new front to shift attention from Ukraine? Although Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008, Belgrade does not recognize it and encourages the Serb community in northern Kosovo to defy Pristina’s authority. Kosovo’s statehood has been accepted by the U.S. and much of the West. Serbia and its allies Russia and China have rejected it and have blocked Kosovo from joining the U.N. and other international institutions.  A few days earlier tensions soared in northern Kosovo after unknown attackers exchanged gunfire with police and threw a stun grenade at European Union officers overnight.  Animosity mounted after Kosovo scheduled local elections in four ethnic Serb-majority municipalities in the north for December 18, with the main Serb political party saying it would stage a boycott.  Explosions and shootings were heard earlier this week as election authorities tried to prepare the ground for the vote, while an ethnic Albanian policeman was wounded after law enforcement was deployed in the region.  Hundreds of ethnic Serbs, outraged over the arrest of a former police officer, gathered early last Sunday at roadblocks they erected the previous day, paralyzing traffic at two border crossings from Kosovo towards Serbia.  Serbian officials claim that the NATO and European Union-led peacekeeping missions are unable to protect the minority Serbs in Kosovo from harassment by majority Kosovo Albanians and that their security forces can do the job.  Aside from requesting authorization from NATO to send its own troop to Kosovo \[which it expects to be denied\], Serbia also raised combat readiness of its troops on the border with Kosovo and warned it would not stand by if Serbs in Kosovo, who make up less than 10% of Kosovo’s population, are attacked.  Is Putin possibly pushing for another open front involving Kosovo backed by NATO and Serbia, backed by Moscow?
How would the Forward Party campaign to get 4%-5% in 4-6 States impact the 2024 General Election? After listening to the latest episode on the Forward Podcast by Andrew Yang that features David Jolly. It seems there is a plan to have a third option in the 2024 Election with the goal of getting nearly 4 or 5% support in the General Election or as Yang stated 70,000 supporters in 4-6 states (PA, AZ, GA, NV, WI and MI).  The goal is then to use the 4% or 5% of their supporters to vote for whichever Political Party that supports the following measures:  &#x200B;  1. Nationwide Ranked Choice Voting 2. Nationwide Open Primaries  They would then work with whichever party is willing to implement the 2 following measures to win the election. The goal is to use competition to get the 2 necessary electoral reforms to make third parties competitive in the coming elections  Could this effort lead the country to having Ranked Choice Voting and Open Primaries nationwide?  Link to discussion: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aj\_rypP0THk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aj_rypP0THk)  Twitter thread: [https://twitter.com/AndrewYang/status/1593612432672440321](https://twitter.com/AndrewYang/status/1593612432672440321)
What if the right of self determination contradict with human right? Thailand have a past history of imperialism and occupy many territory around the kingdom, Islamic Kingdom of Pattani is one of them that get annexed into Thailand in 1900s.     Fast forward to the present, many people there have integrate into Thai culture well. Pattani territory have became a multicultural territory with many different religions and people live there but after the Islamic revival in 1970s many Muslim citizen of Pattani have became more self identified with their religion and the movement of separating their territory to became Islamic state governed by sharia law have arise which get suppressed a lot by the force of central Thai government.     After the decade of the effort to modernizing of Thailand, many of Thai law have contain more aspect of human right (eg. LGBT right, Freedom of religion) despite the fact that the Kingdom still have restriction of free speech and many human right violation that went unsolved. And these law also applied to the Pattani territory and enrage the local because by their sharia law, the act of homosexuality or freedom to leave the religion is prohibited.     With the situation of Southern Thailand insurgency between the force of Islamist separatist and Central Thai government didn't get any better despite government's 18 years effort to resolving the situation, many of former Pattani kingdom's Muslim citizen that are the majority of the area have bring the "Right of self determination" into the topic that it's their right to separating their Pattani state from Thailand and governed itself by the law that they want.     Which came to the question "What if the right of self determination contradict with human right" because what Pattani people have bring up is also one of the universal human right "the right of self determination" but at the same time if their model of self determination state have succeeded the violation of human right of non-Muslim or non-binary group in the area will be guaranteed.      And from this dilemma the left leaning political party in Thailand (Which still the opposition party of the current Military junta government) are still withhold from the decisive decision that which side they should totally support and now the party just support both the right to express their feeling of wanting self determination by the Pattani people freely without being suppressed by the Government and at the same time fighting for the right of non-binary group and secularism across Thailand include in Pattani territory.     What do you think about the situation? Do the right of self determination of Pattani people to create the Islamic state outweigh the leftist principle such as the need to fighting for LGBT right, secularism and universal human right or to maintain human right in the legion is more important than let them self determinate and become a state that guarantee to violate human right?
Are conservatives right to be dissatisfied with Mitch McConnell leadership as the top Republican in the Senate? Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky has been the leader of Senate Republicans since 2007 and was Majority Leader from 2017 to 2020. However, many conservatives and Republicans have been dissatisfied with his reign seeing that he embodies what is the so-called Washington Establishment. Meaning, that McConnell often sides against his more conservative colleagues in order to have a functioning Senate even if it means dealing with Democrats and moderate Republicans to clinch deals rather than holding out for more conservative legislation.  This can be seen in his dealings with president Obama over the debt ceiling crisis of 2011, the Sen. Ted Cruz-led government shutdown in 2013 and his willingness to pass omnibus spending packages with mostly Democratic votes even when he was in the majority under president Trump.  What this means is that McConnell has always had among the lowest approval ratings of any prominent federal political leader. Unlike then-Speaker Pelosi or Sen. Chuck Schumer who were/are approved by their party's base, McConnell always had significant disapproval from within his own party, coming mostly from conservative, anti-establishment types.  The critique these conservatives make is that McConnell is somewhat of a squish as opposed to a stalwart of conservative values. Whereas Democrats would rarely ever make deals with Republicans on legislation that conservatives wanted like building a border wall or cutting government spending, McConnell was all too often open to working with Democrats to expand immigration or increase government pork over the objections of most Republicans. In fact, he'd work with mostly Democrats and a handful of moderate Republicans to pass legislation presidents Obama and Biden favored. That was not the case with president Trump, who was stiffed by Pelosi and Schumer in funding conservative priorities.  What do you make of the complaint by some conservatives that McConnell has not been an effective leader for Senate Republicans? Fair or not? Do you think he stays in leadership under a Republican president in 2024? What about his reelection in 2026 when he'd be 86 years old?
How would an independent Andrew Yang perform in the General Election against a Trump or Biden in 2024? I just finished reading Forward by Andrew Yang and the policies offered by Yang here are very different to the nonexistent party policies presented by the Forward Party.   In Forward though, Yang provided a list of policies that he would champion so let’s say they are his Yang2024 campaign list.   1.	Nationwide RCV  2.	Nationwide Open Primaries  3.	Universal basic income  4.	Universal healthcare  5.	Citizen Portal - a citizen portal where citizens can order new license, new passport, automate their taxes and connect bank for UBI.  6.	Automated Taxes 7.	Combat climate change  8.	Increased spending in NASA.    The Forward Party expect to be on all ballots by 2024.
What is the future of transgender people in America? I've been wanting to ask this question since 2020, but prostrationated as one news story or another came out that affected the lives and rights of transgender people. It's a continuously developing situation, but basically, a lot of transgender people and activists are worried about anti-trans backlash leading to conditions where a transgender person couldn't exist in society. They fear this would lead to mass imprisonment, death, or even worst; forced detransition of transgender people. It is, [in their words,](https://twitter.com/erininthemorn/status/1592537745167376385) genocide. Echoed by these activists are comparisons to [Wiemar Germany](https://transsafety.network/posts/social-terror/), [which had a nascent LGBT community](https://mjhnyc.org/blog/transgender-experiences-in-weimar-and-nazi-germany/) and transgender healthcare clinic, but was destroyed when the Nazis took power in 1933; Nazis went on to target queer men and women in the Holocaust. So, transgender people are worried history will repeat itself.  I personally do not know what will happen. Transgender people have gained acceptance and increased rights during the Obama and Trump Administrations, namely in recognition of their gender, increased access to healthcare via the ACA and [informed consent](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/1/viewer?mid=1DxyOTw8dI8n96BHFF2JVUMK7bXsRKtzA&ll=26.19982757169328%2C-113.38234069999999&z=3) for transgender adults, and increased ease in changing legal documents like drivers licenses, passports, and birth certificates. The [Supreme Court ruled in 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bostock_v._Clayton_County) that LGBTQ+ people could not be discriminated against in employment. [Far right candidates](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2022/06/28/americans-complex-views-on-gender-identity-and-transgender-issues/), most of which pushed anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric, lost key races in the 2022 midterm.  Yet the number and [extremity](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2022/11/04/florida-board-votes-to-ban-gender-affirming-care-for-transgender-youth/?sh=22c8f02552ae) of [anti-LGBTQ+ bills](https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/nearly-240-anti-lgbtq-bills-filed-2022-far-targeting-trans-people-rcna20418) broke records in 2021 and [2022](https://www.npr.org/2022/06/24/1107244492/texas-gop-platform-embraces-far-right-and-anti-gay-rhetoric). Pew Research polls showed transgender acceptance [peaking in 2017](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2022/06/28/americans-complex-views-on-gender-identity-and-transgender-issues/) but declined by 6 percentage points by 2022. Today, reports came out saying Texas AG Ken Paxton [requested Texas DPS](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/12/14/texas-transgender-data-paxton/) provide a list of people who changed the gender marked on their drivers licenses.  I could go on, but again, I'm not sure how this will develop. I'm a transgender woman and a lesbian myself, so I'm looking to ask people who are outside the LGBTQ+ community on their perspective and predictions.     EDIT: I posted about America, but I'm more than open to hearing from people from outside America and their perspective on what's happening in their country.
Crypto Regulations With the FTX collapse senate hearings occuring, there are many questions raised on how cryoto should be dealt with. Will this create more moral hazard, end crypto entirely, or will it actually prove useful as a commodity or security?
Does the Media do more harm than good when publishing some of what Putin states? Many papers have published what Putin has said lately about a “first-strike nuclear strategy” where supposedly they would bomb Ukraine first in order to turn the tables in their war.  But are these papers doing more harm than they should when publishing this? Putin’s western media strategy has always been to keep his intentions ambiguous. Even his (recently former) advisor penned his media approach as “strategic ambiguity,” and obviously our outlets here know this, but still even the most reputable sources publish these ambiguous things that Putin apparently intends to do.   Are they being socially responsible when publishing this. I mean I doubt they ALL do it simply to stoke fear and drive up clicks… but are they?  Obviously they can’t ignore everything Putin says, but it’s so clear that he’s been using western media as a political tool for years now.   I have no real specific question here. Just wondering where people’s opinions are on this.
What is causing the rising trend of civil unrest across the western world? Last week, Germany Authorities stopped a coup attempt to capture the health minister and cause widespread blackouts across the country with the goal of restoring the German Empire. The United States has within the past few weeks seen multiple attempts to take down the powergrid, as well as the infamous coup attempt of january 6 a little over a year ago. Canada saw the convoy protests earlier this year that caused havoc in Canda's economy during the time it was occuring, and is often described as canada's "January 6th." The U.K. is experiencing multiple strikes from multiple industries throughout this month and protest after protest.  I am making this post to ask the following key questions:  1.) What is causing this rising trend of civil unrest?  2.) How does it compare to earlier periods of civil unrest?  3.) What makes this current period of civil unrest unique?  4.) What can be done to resolve this?
Why aren't the Dems more seriously pursuing a moderate for Speaker of the House? Given the GOP's mutiny against McCarthy, why aren't the Democrats more seriously pursuing a "unity" candidate for Speaker? A moderate Democrat would probably cause the GOP to coalesce around McCarthy and therefore be a non-starter, but a moderate Republican with upward ambitions wouldn't be a huge lift.   It would only take 5 defections to pull this off and they could extract some valuable promises from anyone they put forward. Limit the crazy BS hearings. No BS impeachments. Possible up/down votes on certain legislation. No debt ceiling bullshit.   Obviously getting progressives to vote for a Republican for Speaker would not necessarily be optically ideal, but if the choice is between voting for a moderate or not voting for McCarthy and letting him become Speaker from the MAGA-enablers, what is there to lose? It would be a pretty huge black eye for the freedom caucus and MAGA.  There are a number of potential candidates, but Valadao and Newhouse would be early options as the two surviving House Reps that voted for impeachment in 2020.
Where will the money for reparations in California come from? Hello :)  So I have been following the current development in California with great interest. I have a NYTimes link right here:  https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/01/business/economy/california-black-reparations.html  Now while I think this is a big step towards healing the past injustice, I am wondering where this money will actually come from as 500 billion USD is a huge price tag. With the larger cities in California still suffering from an unprecedented homelessness crisis, that money would likely have to be appropriated from a federal level, but I do not see that happening with the nation still hurting from the pandemic.   From a different angle - a non-american angle - could that plan maybe even destabilze California? The article quotes that only 28% of white americans support this plan. With f.e. Los Angeles still suffering from an intense economical crisis due to the pandemic, might that cause an even deeper divide between black and non-black citizens?  Cheers, Winston
Would a compromise of getting rid of abortion in favor of artificial wombs for any woman who wants to use one be agreeable terms? A video that has been making round is the ectolife artificial womb concept video. When I watched the video it described that in the future artificial wombs could be made to incubate babies until they are ready for birth allowing for people to have children who normally couldn't or transfer the baby to a pod if a woman could no longer carry the baby. This got me thinking that it could make the abortion debate irrelevant as an artificial womb could be used to grow babies. If sometime in the future artificial womb technology becomes advanced enough to actually allow for babies to be transfered from a real womb to an artificial womb I believe a fair compromise could be made, where any woman who has an unwanted pregnancy could have the baby removed from her womb and transfered to an artificial womb where it can grow until birth, woman would no longer have to deal with unwanted pregnancy, but the baby can be born into this world. If sometime in the future the US agrees to fund artificial womb use to any woman who desires it due to an unwanted pregnancy along with improving the foster care system in the US on the condition that artificial wombs be used instead of abortion, would those terms be agreeable?  Video mentioned in the beginning  https://youtu.be/O2RIvJ1U7RE
Which scenario is better for dems? Desantis will probably run, and I’m wondering which scenario is better for dems.  Is it if Desantis wins the primary, and trump runs as a third party candidate making it Biden vs Desantis vs Trump?  Or is it if Trump wins the primary and leads the party again?  From one perspective, the rupturing of the Republican Party would be better, but from another, many are saying desantis is too dangerous to have as an opponent.  What do you think, and is there and objective way to think about this?
Stay or Leave If you were a 31 year old Ukrainian Man, your wife, children & the rest of your family has left the country and are safe abroad. You lived in Ukraine your entire life & now Russia has occupied half of your country, is there a moral obligation as an adult male citizen of fighting age to stay and fight or would saving your own life and joining your family overseas be a more expedient choice rather than facing an invader with much more fire & man power?  Assuming you do leave(personally I would), should you feel guilt for the men who decided to stay, who 'd include friends & colleagues? Fighting-age men who declined going to each world war were humiliated in the west, especially by the women whose husbands, father's & brothers went to go fight, would it be justified for Ukrainian women in the same situation to similarly disparage you?
Using South African president Cyril Ramaphosa as an example which would be more important to you in politics if you were forced to choose? A leader that is competent or a leader that is free from corruption? Most people would of course say both, but lets say in a hypothetical world you had to choose. Which one would you pick? I'm using the current South African president Cyril Ramaphosa as an example because highlights this paradox in an interesting way. Currently the South African president is facing an impeachment vote for what is called the "Phalaphala scandal" which involved hundreds of thousands of dollars of undeclared cash at a private farm he owns. Expanding this out, Ramaphosa' style of politics is one of backroom dealings. Which has cast both a negative shadow on South African politics as well as produced positive outcomes.  During his long tenure in South African politics both as president, Deputy president, trade unionist and then massive businessmen he has done many backroom deals which has lead to several questions of conflicts of interests. This includes his investments in Mcdonalds, mining companies such as Lonmin, arms dealerships, Glencore(a major oil and gas company) and other ventures. The conflict of interests arises in terms of these companies then giving kick backs to his political campaigns in exchange for favours. In addition one of the companies he had investments in, Lomnin, was at the centre of a major scandal involving workers rights at the Marikana mine  On the flip side his acumen for making deals has also played a role in some of the major achievements of South Africa politics. He was Nelson Mandela's chief negotiator after his release and played a key role in negotiating the end of Apartheid. He then played a role in the formation of South Africa's constitution guaranteeing democratic freedoms, and the protection of rights on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, gender, and sexual orientation, the last one being a major progressive step for the 1990s. Internationally he was also a key negotiator in the Northern Ireland peace process playing a role in the peace deal as well as the IRA's disarmament(the connection to South Africa is the IRA's support for the ANC during the anti apartheid struggle) as well as political crises that arose in countries like Lesotho. As a co chair of South Africa's AIDs council he played a role in directing the nation away from AIDS denial to addressing the HIV/AIDS pandemic which ended up saving thousands of lives. During his presidency he lead South Africa's response to COVID which early on won international praise. He also secured leadership of the African Union as its chair where he was able to also able to navigate a continent wide response to the pandemic, mediation in many conflicts as well as the promotion of women's rights. He also was able to manage South Africa's electricity crisis in the poor townships through negotiation with the energy and business sectors as well as the removing of redtape that makes energy access difficult.  So he has corruption and conflict of interest issues which has built up to an impeachment vote. But he's also a competent and skillful politician, policy maker and negotiator. Applying this to any political context(including American politics) which if the two would be more important if you had to choose.
What do you want your taxes dollars spent on? Serious question  What do you want to have your tax dollars go to? This question is in response to the ever-popular phrase "I don't want my money to go to" usually in opposition to new government funding. Instead of focusing on where money shouldn't go, let's reframe it as where it should go. And who better to ask than the internet?   Obviously funding, and the amount being spent on X is a separate conversation. 
Putin said Russia could amend its military doctrine by introducing the possibility of a preemptive strike, also asserting Russia's weapons are better than US. Russia believes, this is necessary to protect itself from the U.S. Europe, and Australia. Is Putin's fear justified or is this Paranoia? Russian President Vladimir Putin has declared that Moscow might think about adopting what he described as a U.S. concept of a preemptive military strike, noting that Rusia has the weapons to do the job.   [https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/putin-russia-adopt-us-preemptive-strike-concept-94876110](https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/putin-russia-adopt-us-preemptive-strike-concept-94876110)  The Kremlin chief also claimed that Russia's cruise missiles and hypersonic systems were "more modern and even more efficient" than those in the United States.

[Putin is 'desperate not to lose': Russian experts assess Ukraine war (cnbc.com)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/29/putin-is-desperate-not-to-lose-russian-experts-assess-ukraine-war.html)   However, not everyone agrees with that assessment in the West. For instance, Douglas Macgregor, Col. (ret.) who is a senior fellow with *The American Conservative*, the former advisor to the Secretary of Defense in the Trump administration, has drastically different views and assessments.   Macgregor recently opined that a coming offensive phase of the conflict will provide a glimpse of the new Russian force that is emerging and its future capabilities. [At this writing](https://www.19fortyfive.com/2022/11/putin-could-launch-a-big-winter-offensive-in-ukraine-to-cut-off-weapons/), 540,000 Russian combat forces are assembled in Southern Ukraine, Western Russia, and Belarus. The numbers continue to grow, but the numbers already include 1,000 rocket artillery systems, thousands of tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and drones, plus 5,000 armored fighting vehicles, including at least 1,500 tanks, hundreds of manned fixed-wing attack aircraft, helicopters, and bombers.

Multiracial working class GOP So I'm hearing about this idea (NR the editors podcast and other places) that the GOP is moving towards becoming a working class party and that African Americans and Hispanics are moving toward the GOP.  What does this mean for support in the GOP for government social spending programs and specifically things like obamacare? Even if certain hispanic and black people are more socially conservative they also support government spending at higher rates than their white counterparts. There was a graph I saw before (I can't find it now) that showed support for the ACA by race and iirc it showed white support at around 45-50%, black support around 75-80%, and hispanic support around 55-60%
Will other politicians follow Sinema's example of leaving their party if they face a serious primary challenge? It seems like in states which follow FPTP at least, this is a pretty decent strategy, as it forces your former party to either nominate someone and split the vote, or to just stop themselves from nominating anyone and letting you through  If Sinema's gambit ends up being successful, will we see an uptick in senators and representatives declaring independence
Theoretical independent coalition in US Senate Let’s say there were small handful of independent senators who chose not to caucus in either party and the math left the Ds and Rs with equal votes (including VP tiebreak). Would the independents practically be able to call the shots in terms of committee assignments and key legislation, since they always have the threat of caucusing either side and changing the majority?
What would an ethics committee or code look like? So recently people have been talking about implementing a Senate lead ethics committee or legislating a code of ethics against the SCOTUS.  Which raises the question, how exactly would that work and what would be the enforcement mechanics?

Did the suppression of the Hunter Biden laptop story on twitter sway the 2020 election? With the release of the Twitter files 2.0, the right wing media sphere is claiming that the laptop story was supressed. That 16 percent of people who voted for Biden would have changed their votes. Is this correct?   Why is the Hunter Biden laptop story material? Why not?

How does this change the dynamics in the Senate? How does this shake up the race for her seat next year?  Does this seem like a last ditch effort to avoid any kind of primary from a Democratic challenger in the upcoming race? Does this change what committee memberships she'll end up with or change the Arizona publics view of her as a senator?
What is causing this small miracle in Alaska? Moderate Republicans and Democrats co-governing Something weird (for the US) is happening in Alaska. In a state known for extreme winters and petro economics, and for its fierce conservatism that saw Donald Trump beat Joe Biden by 10 points, Alaska state Republicans and Democrats are actually cooperating. Not only are they cooperating, but they are actually forming a governing coalition together. A bipartisan coalition. That’s pretty peculiar in the US, kind of like seeing someone wearing an Inuit parka at the equator.  Is the use of Ranked Choice Voting  contributing toward a changed political culture, in which moderate Republicans, tired of obstructionist Trumpists, are reaching across the aisle, not only during elections but during the governing process itself?  Could be a model for Speaker-hopeful Kevin McCarthy, since far-right House Republicans are opposing his Speaker bid? Democratic House whip James Clyburn has proposed that McCarthy should reach across the aisle and strike a bipartisan deal to win Democratic votes. That would isolate the MAGAs and reclaim the GOP from extremists.   Lots of interesting dimensions to discuss.

If a Constitutional Convention could be called, what would you want to see changed? A convention to amend the constitution can be called by two thirds of state legislatures and amendments approved by three fourths of the states. Article 5 of the constitution establishes this as a legitimate way to propose amendments, though it has never been called outside the original convention. Is it even possible in our polarized political climate?
Investigations in the New Congress Having secured a thin majority, Republicans in the House of Representatives are promising/threatening investigations into everything from Hunter Biden, to the operation of the DOJ, to the House’s own January 6 Committee.  But, with Ralph Warnick’s victory, the Democrats in the Senate now also have investigatory subpoena power, and, technically, could wield it to conduct politically motivated investigations.  Will this seeming balance of power and promise of mutual assured destruction likely deter some of the more egregious political investigation circuses that we would otherwise have seen?
Why did Brian kemp outperform Herschel walker so much? Georgia is a fascinating state to study when it comes to it’s elections.   In the Georgia governor election. Brian kemp received 2.1 million votes. He lost the Atlanta suburbs and the city of Atlanta but he kept the margins smaller and ran it up in rural counties which is key for a Republican to win statewide anywhere. The reason democrats have been able to start winning the state of Georgia is because it is a much more urban state than a place like North Carolina for example. The metropolitan Atlanta area comprises of 59% of Georgia’s vote.   The problem for Herschel walker is that around 250,000 people who voted for kemp did not vote for him. He lost the Atlanta suburbs by a wide margin. Counties that were once reliably Republican but now they’ve shifted. He didn’t have to win them but he had it make it close and he was not able to do that. He also underperformed kemp in the Republican leaning areas. So the biggest takeaway here is that  quite a few moderate Georgia voters were comfortable re electing Brian kemp and even a republican lt governor outright without a runoff but they couldn’t bring themselves to support Herschel walker.    The Atlanta suburbs have a lot more white collar college educated people living there compared to places like south or North Carolina. For the longest time Georgia voted to the right of Florida but now Florida is voting much more to the right than Georgia is. Which I find fascinating.
Is there any connection between the modern social justice movement and the Soviet legal theory of revolutionary justice? Awhile ago I learned about revolutionary justice - the legal theory used in the Soviet Union to address questions that the young country didn't yet have a sufficiently mature legal framework for - and also to excuse the practice of bending a court's interpretation of the laws as written to the current demands of the Soviet leaders.  When I heard the name, I was reminded of the Social Justice moment - especially the fact that people in the Social Justice moment like to speak of "[Insert Cause Here] Justice". Some examples that I've seen are:  X Climate Justice X Economic Justice X Racial Justice  This similarity of terms, along with the fact that the Social Justice movement is a Marxist ideology, led me to wonder: did the founders of the modern Social Justice movement name their movement after the Soviet legal theory with a similar name?  If not, is there some connection between the two other than one being directly named after the other?

Homelessness in Portland, Oregon — Any good ideas on how to address it? I think everyone can agree it’s an issue, but that seems to be where it stops. Anyone who lives in or has visited Portland (or reads national news) knows the city has a serious homelessness crisis. The issue has to do in large part from untreated drug addiction and mental illnesses.   Portlanders are tired of dealing with the issue, businesses are leaving, and obviously most people living on the streets would choose otherwise. So what can be done?   Should homeless people be rounded up and put into camps (like the city recently announced it plans to do)? Should people be allowed to sleep wherever they choose? Should Portland bus them out of the state? As an Oregonian, this is a problem that has stumped me (and my state’s leadership, clearly) for a long time. Any ideas?

What are the most common credible criticisms of Mexico's election authorities? * I don't follow Mexican politics very closely, and I rely mostly on mainstream English-language sources. *  As I understand it, President Obrador recently tried to pass a constitutional amendment to reform Mexico's electoral system, failed, but then successfully got narrower reforms passed in the legislature. * [This article](https://www.npr.org/2022/11/27/1139383203/mexicos-president-lopez-obrador-leads-a-massive-pro-government-march) (plus MORENA's electoral success) suggests that there is a lot of popular support for the constitutional amendment, but I have seen lots of criticism as well, e.g. [here](https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/12/05/mexico-reject-presidents-elections-overhaul).  Based on the above, I think I get a basic idea of the case against the amendment. **So I'm trying to understand what credible arguments there are in favor of the amendment.**  Here are the arguments that I've seen in the past, ranked by how often I have seen them (1 is the most common):  1. it will save money; 2. it will help consolidate MORENA's power (also an argument against); 3. it has popular support; 4. it would be "more democratic" because more election officials would be elected rather than appointed; 5. it would be accompanied by other popular reforms.  But I feel like maybe I'm missing something. Are there credible criticisms of the institutions that run elections in Mexico? Do some people credibly see them as badly designed, poor-performing, or corrupt? How much difference to they really make to the budget? Are some officials seen as out-of-touch due to wealth or status? Something else? I don't know.  A lot of people will probably tell me that the "real motivation" is to undermine Mexico's electoral system and weaken a class of people who don't like MORENA. I'm open to that as an explanation, but I'm mostly trying to understand the other side.
How is it possible for any one party to hold power in all branches of government? I don't mean this mechanically, but more from a poli sci perspective (I am not a poli sci major btw lol). We are a nation that prides it's self on checks and balances yet the idea that one party can hold power in the executive, judicial, and both the house and the Senet kind of undermines that. Doesn't it?  Yes another party is still there and dose hold some sway, but the party in power can enact legislation with an ease that a balanced system would not allow. Is this an oversight in the structure of our government or is it just that a 2 party system lends itself to this kind of imbalance?

Will it come down along partisan line, 6-3, or will we see some of the conservative justices reject the theory?
Why Has The Republican Party Become the Party of Oil and Gas? The strong ties between Republicans and the oil and gas industry have grown stronger still since the 1970s, to the point where the GOP now regularly receives about 85% of the industry's political money; top oil and gas states such as Texas, Oklahoma, Alaska and Louisiana are strongly Republican; and Republicans are increasingly drawn into partnerships with oil-dominated governments such as Russia and Saudi Arabia. Meanwhile China, lacking oil and gas resources while embracing clean energy, is a continual Republican pariah.  What accounts for this partnership between the world's largest industry and the Republican Party?
Are Supreme Court case decisions a foregone conclusion, aligning with political party partisanship? Ideally, Supreme Court justices are granted a lifetime position so they could be above the fray when it comes to political squabbles. They shouldn’t be beholden to their respective political parties, whether Democratic or Republican. In this way, you would see decisions that shock their own political party from time to time, because they’re above political partisanship and are making decisions consistent with their own thinking. In this way, their decision making becomes almost predictable over time.   Are we seeing hyper partisanship creeping into Supreme Court decisions? Basically if you have the majority vote, all decisions will favor not conservatism or liberalism, constitutional expansionism or originalism, but they will instead bend over backwards, breaking with their own supposed stances and make whatever decision currently benefits their respective political party at the time? Are we seeing a Supreme Court that is nakedly biased and partisan, and just an extended arm of whatever political party holds the court at the time?
Jan 6, Panel: “We have not made a decision as to who, but we have made decisions that criminal referrals will happen..." Referrals are not binding on DOJ; However, is it likely Trump is specifically included in the criminal referral as a target? Committee chair Bennie Thompson told reporters on Tuesday that the panel’s probe, one of the most politically sensitive in decades, was still working out details, but that it would recommend charges be brought. He declined to identify the charges or prosecution targets the panel is considering for criminal referrals.  Throughout the committee’s proceedings, members have made clear they hold Trump responsible for inciting the attack on the Capitol in an effort to overturn President Joe Biden’s victory.  Witnesses who’ve been interviewed by the panel include presidential staff and lawyers as well as law enforcement officers and others who testified to what was going on in the White House as hundreds of rioters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, to stop the US House from certifying the 2020 election.  The charges may include perjury, Thompson said, also without providing any details. “Well, that’s part of the discussion. Yeah,” he said. Among other potential charges are criminal contempt of Congress, obstruction of justice, obstruction of an official government proceeding and conspiracy.  Garland last month appointed a special prosecutor, John L. “Jack” Smith, to oversee investigations into the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection at the US Capitol — including any role Trump may have played — as well as the former president’s handling of classified White House records after he left office.  More than 900 people have been arrested for taking part in the assault. Of those, more than half have pleaded guilty or been convicted at trial.  Is it likely Trump is specifically included in the criminal referral as a target?

If Warnock wins the run-off, Democrats will decide what bills and resolutions come to the floor. They will have a majority on every committee and subcommittees. If Walker wins, these have to be negotiated. Yet, neither Biden nor Trump went to campaign for their candidate. Are they both, a liability? The significant of who wins the Georgia run-off cannot be underestimated, a Republican win at least gives them some breathing room and ability to negotiate on important issues such as committees and chair. It also restrains Democrats when it comes to nominations to important positions \[even the Supreme Court, should a vacancy come about\]. Democrats would have to keep every member on board including Manchin and Sinema, with Harris as the tie-breaker.  Although Obama went to campaign on behalf of Warnock during the run-off and Lindsey and Cruz also showed up for Walker, along with Kemp \[the Governor elect\]. Neither Biden nor Trump showed up and there is no plan for either of them to go there to show support.  Is this an indication that this run-off is not so much about how the hard-core base goes, but rather, the moderates and both Biden and Trump could alienate the moderates or is there some other reason for their absence?

Does Biden's Proposed Changes To Early Primaries Signal Who He Wants As His Successor? [I know there's another recent post on this, but I wanted a more narrow question.]  Biden recently called for an overhaul to the early (pre-Super Tuesday) elections in the Democratic primaries. [[Source for reference](https://www.axios.com/2022/12/02/biden-democrat-primary-overhaul-call).] The plan would drop Iowa as an early state, move South Carolina from fourth to first, and add Michigan and Georgia as early states. Georgia was in the last 10 in 2020, and Michigan was the week after Super Tuesday.  There's also been a lot of speculation about who could be Biden's successor either in 2028, or 2024 if he decides not to run. On the short list of possibilities has been Pete Buttigieg. He was not only given a cabinet position, but has been a prominent spokesman for the party.  However, Iowa was Buttigieg's best state (25.1%) and South Carolina was his worst (8.2%).  A major dynamic in the early states that severely hurt Buttigieg was his very low polling with black voters. Georgia is 26.7% black, and South Carolina is 33%. (Michigan is 14.1%, just slightly over the national average.)  If Biden's changes were adopted, it would seem very difficult for a Buttigieg campaign to go into Super Tuesday with any sort of momentum.  So to the question in the title: **Does Biden's proposed changes to early primaries signal who he wants as his successor?**  And of course, if so, who does this most help? Harris? Booker? Abrams?
Ted Cruz sides with Bernie Sanders to give rail workers more sick days [[Texas Tribune Article](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/12/01/ted-cruz-john-cornyn-bernie-sanders-railroad-union/)]  I’m reposting this because apparently we’re not allowed to share opinions in this community? Well, I am objectively asking:   What kinda crazy world is this, that we have Republicans supporting union actions with Bernie Sanders, while the longtime “Union-Friendly” candidates / politicians are all saying they did the best they could, even though it is beginning to appear that they did not fight all that hard. Joe Biden said that the paid sick leave “just wasn’t that big of a priority this time for the unions” in his press conference the other day. But “members [of congress] were split on whether to include seven paid sick days in the resolution to keep the railroads running — one of the biggest points of contention between the unions and rail companies that failed to be included in the prior contract agreement.”   Don’t get me wrong, I realize that the large majority of Republicans are anti-labor. John Cornyn warned against “‘kowtowing to organized labor above the interest of any and all other Americans.’” And “[he voted] for the final resolution to force the labor agreement, saying the Railway Labor Act gave Congress a responsibility to prevent a rail shutdown,”   Democrats since Clinton have had less labor-friendly administrations than before the Reagan years, but are we seeing the beginnings of a big shift? Or no?

Will the reshoring of US manufacturing jobs in various industries (semiconductor, battery, auto, etc.) ultimately cause consumer good prices to go up, and backfire?  One of the advantages of outsourcing manufacturing to a developing country is that it's cheap due to currency exchange rate. Additionally it helps the developing country to grow its labor force and increase it's own GDP and GDP per capita. The client country would benefit from low cost of goods, thus making it accessible to more consumers and generating greater revenues and hopefully higher profit margins.  However, with the recent reshoring of many manufacturing jobs in various sectors ranging from semiconductor manufacturing to automobile manufacturing, I wonder if there will be negative repercussions due to the USDs very high value at the moment. Wouldn't this just make manufacturing more expensive both for the US as well as other countries that seek to outsource their manufacturing to us?  Or, is there some sort of workaround wherein we can have the best of both worlds by getting back our manufacturing but still keeping it affordable for clients who require it?
If Trump doesn't win the primaries, what will happen when he says the election is rigged? The big debate over this last election is that it was "rigged" by the democrats.  They must be extremely fearful what Trump will do if he loses the republican primary in 2024.  What if he loses?  His track record shows that he will accuse the Republican party of being cheaters.  I wonder if certain people will all of a sudden require evidence for these claims to be true, or if they will go along with it like they did in 2020.
On September 18, CA Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill to strengthen penalties for using hate symbols such as swastikas This bill was inspired in part because Marin DA Lori Frugoli didn’t want to prosecute a Nazi for posting swastikas up in Fairfax because someone vandalized a church statue.  Is hate crime legislation an effective means of tamping down on hate?
SCOTUS decided to hear Biden's Student Loan Forgiveness case on the merits instead of pausing the injunction. The Supreme Court will now decide whether the Biden administration had overstepped its Executive Authority. Is it more likely it will find POTUS exceeded its Executive Authority? In its order [Miscellaneous Order (12/01/2022) (supremecourt.gov)](https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/120122zr_d18f.pdf), the court scheduled the oral arguments to be heard February 2023.       The Biden administration defends the loan forgiveness program, citing in particular the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act of 2003. This authorizes the Department of Education to forgive the student loans of some borrowers who are at risk of default because of a "war, military operation, or national emergency." COVID-19, the administration argues, is a qualifying national emergency under the statute, as it was formally declared a national emergency by then-President Trump, and, subsequently, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos invoked the HEROES Act when pausing loan repayments early in the pandemic. The Biden administration argues that the need to mitigate the financial hardship caused by the pandemic has not gone away.   Biden's plan would cancel up to $20,000 in student loan debt for Pell Grant recipients, and $10,000 for other borrowers, for people earning up to $125,000 a year or part of a household where total earnings are no more than $250,000.   Six conservative states – Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska and South Carolina – told the Supreme Court that [Biden overstepped his legal authority](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/11/23/student-debt-loan-relief-supreme-court-states/10761989002/) with the program and violated the constitutional principle of separation of powers by embarking on a loan forgiveness program estimated to affect 40 million Americans.      A federal judge in [Missouri dismissed the states' request](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/10/20/student-loan-debt-forgiveness-lawsuit-gop-states-dismissed/10556660002/) to block the program in October, ruling that they lacked standing to sue. While their case presented "important and significant challenges to the debt relief plan," the trial court ruled, "the current plaintiffs are unable to proceed." On appeal, the St. Louis-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit [sided with the states' request to temporarily halt the program](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/11/14/student-loan-debt-forgiveness-blocked-appeals-court-puts-plan-hold/10592105002/).  More recently the court has been reluctant to expand Executive authority and even questioned the conservative have even questioned the Chevron Deference standards. [Supreme Court rules against EPA effort to regulate power plant emissions](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/06/30/supreme-court-epa-effort-curb-power-plant-emissions-climate-change/7390889001/)  The Supreme Court, in January, halted [Biden's COVID-19 vaccine-or-testing mandate](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/01/13/supreme-court-halts-bidens-covid-19-mandates-large-employers/9160176002/) for large employers. And in June, the high court shot down an [Environmental Protection Agency effort](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/06/30/supreme-court-epa-effort-curb-power-plant-emissions-climate-change/7390889001/) to curb power plant emissions. Last year, it [blocked Biden’s eviction moratorium](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/08/27/supreme-court-blocks-president-bidens-covid-19-eviction-moratorium/8243599002/) on similar grounds.  Those decisions follow a yearslong push by conservatives to curb the "administrative state." They argue federal agencies should have less power to act unless there's clear congressional approval. The Supreme Court bolstered that approach in June by relying on the "major questions doctrine" to [decide a climate change case](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/06/30/supreme-court-epa-effort-curb-power-plant-emissions-climate-change/7390889001/).  Evidently, the Supreme Court decided to hear the case on the merits to put multiple cases to rest and issue a decision determining the limitations of Executive Authority. Is it more likely it will find POTUS exceeded its Executive Authority?
Are Oligarchies a necessary part of the modern state? Why must they form? Two examples in body Let's take two examples:  In China, the growing oligarch class poses a threat to PRC rule and measures are taken to ensure they do not usurp power (and therefore legitimacy) from government. All Chinese industry are quasi public/private institutions as it is, with the PRC capable of revoking business rights if say a charismatic Bo Xilai figure emerges or exerts too much influence. But why wouldn't China be able to simply eliminate oligarchs?  In Russia, I've been told that Putin depends on his oligarchs to run Russian industry. They are obscenely wealthy, but operate at the pleasure of Putin. Why couldn't Putin do away with them, as they also pose a threat to his rule?  Are there any examples of a solidly functioning state, say, Denmark, that do not possess an influential oligarchy? Is there value in having an oligarchy? Just seems to me that their ability to undermine government as in the US, makes them a threat to society, which is why all ruling parties are hesitant to manage their relationship with them.
If the 2024 US presidential election resulted in the Republican candidate winning the popular vote but losing the electoral college, would Republicans start to support getting rid of the electoral college? The 2022 election results suggest shifts in the electorate that could make this scenario, which once seemed quite unlikely, a real possibility.  Specifically, Republicans will gain a lot of popular votes but not a ton of electoral ones if they continue to make gains with Latino voters, especially in Florida.  The scenario looks something like this:  * Florida becomes a deep red state with the Republican winning by 20 like DeSantis did (maybe it'll be DeSantis himself). * Texas moves a bit back towards Republicans from where it was in 20' and 16' (Abbot won by 12 vs. Trump's 9 and 5.5 point wins).  * New York and California both get a bit less blue (the statewide elections in both states were closer in 22' than 20', especially in New York). * Democrats very narrowly win Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan (similar to 20').  This ends up with a map that looks something like this ([https://www.270towin.com/maps/mroJY](https://www.270towin.com/maps/mroJY))--you could also flip Wisconsin for Georgia or Arizona if you think that's more likely and it wouldn't change the popular vote count by that much.    So now maybe you have a Democrat get elected (or re-elected) President with just a very small majority of the electoral vote and a Republican who lost despite winning the popular vote maybe by millions.  Put this in the context of a Republican base that is already primed to believe that elections they lose are illegitimate and it seems like there might be a lot of pressure on Republicans to support a change.    Would they?  Or would they see the bigger picture and think leaving the electoral college in place would be more likely to help them in the long run?  Meanwhile, how would Democrats react?  Would they continue to support reform?
Why did Republicans vote against the Rail Deal? There were two versions of resolutions to enforce a railroad contract and avoid a strike and both versions have passed the house with bipartisan majorities, but with the majority of republicans voting against them. The bills now go to the senate, where the majority of Republicans are expected to vote against them.  &#x200B;  My question is why? The obvious cynical answer is that they are reflexively voting against anything that democrats support, and that they think a rail strike would hurt Biden. But I haven't seen any republicans offer any ideological or practical justification to their opposition. Have any given one?
Do you think a Country with nuklear weapons could be defeated? Most realistic WWIII scenario would be NATO vs China/Russia/NK with India somewhere in between. If one of the sides could push back the enemy so drastically back that they might use a Nuke. So i think: is a war today between nuklear powers even winable like in WW 1 and 2. No site will surrender as long as there able to make a nuklear attack. What is your thoughts about this?
Why weren't there more accusations of voter fraud this election cycle like in 2020? It is well known that after Donald Trump lost, he and his supporters said it was due to foul play and fraud.  The Republican Party has been playing up a red wave for months now. Joe Biden has relatively low approval ratings. The economy is a mixed bag with high levels of uncertainty and inflation.    But the Democratic Party ended up performing way better than expected and even retained their position in the Senate.  In fact, there's even the vibe[there's even the vibe](https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/11/politics/trump-republicans-move-on-2024) among some Republicans that Trump is to blame for the less than stellar performance by the opposition party which goes against a classic trend within American politics.  After all, many candidates that Trump endorsed ended up failing to win their races.   A lot of people were afraid that if the scenario played out that the Republican Party would just scream FRAUD! again, further delegitimizing American Democracy.  Why didn't this happen?
What are the implications of Cochise county in AZ refusing to certify their election? What is the procedural next steps to concluding the election and declaring a winner? Cochise county, for context, is a county in Arizona that learns Republican. The people in charge of certifying their election have refused to do so. Currently they are being sued so that they are compelled to certify. Should the results of Cochise county not be certified by the procedural deadline, their votes will be ignored. This will swing the election enough that the democrats will win a house seat for arizona instead of the current Republican winner.  I am making this post to ask the following key questions:  1.) How Can the state / courts enforce certification of Cochise county’s election results?   2.) what are the implications should Cochise county not certify results in time, thus changing the outcome of the house race?
What should "the other side" look like? I'm curious what a "reasonable" version of the opposing party looks like for people. What does a reasonable republican platform look like to Dems, what amount of government would the libertarians among us find acceptable, etc.   Not looking for what would make you vote for them, more so what does a version of the "opposing" party look like to you where you sort of go, "okay, I respect that, disagree, but I respect where you're coming from."
How difficult should it be to change a constitution? In the US an amendment may be proposed by a two-thirds vote of both Houses of Congress, or, if two-thirds of the States request one. The amendment must then be ratified by three-fourths of the State legislatures, or three-fourths of conventions called in each State for ratification.   While in Canada an amendment needs to be approved by 1) the federal Parliament, 2) the Senate, and 3) a minimum number of provincial legislatures. There must be at least seven provinces that approve the change, representing at least 50% of Canada's population.   Should it be easier or more difficult to change a constitution?
Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes [who did not go into Capitol] was convicted of seditious conspiracy, as was Kelly Megs [interfering with peaceful transfer of power/overthrow government]. Are these verdicts a deterrence to such behavior or would these verdicts turn them into Martyrs? The jury has convicted Kelly Meggs of seditious conspiracy in addition to Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes. The three other defendants were acquitted of that charge. However, all 5 were convicted of one or other form of obstruction of proceedings \[felonies\]. Jury rejected the arguments that this was merely a protest that got out of hand and instead found that this was a well-planned insurrection in rendering the verdicts.   The Justice Department, which has argued that the US Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021, was more than just a political protest that got out of control — but rather a violent attack on the seat of American democracy and an effort to keep Biden out of the Oval Office by any means necessary.  The history of [the seditious conspiracy statute ](https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/03/politics/seditious-conspiracy-oath-keepers-trial)dates back to the start of the Civil War when Congress made it a crime to conspire to overthrow the US government or to conspire to use force to “prevent, hinder, or delay the execution of any law of the United States.”  In the infrequent cases when prosecutors have brought the charge, they have not always been successful in securing a conviction.  The last time it was charged – against a Michigan militia accused of plotting an attack on law enforcement – the count was dismissed by a judge in 2012 who said the Justice Department failed to show that there was a “concrete agreement to forcibly oppose the United States government.”  Officer  Fanone who was wounded on January 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol remarked that the House Select Committee investigating the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol did a good job making connections between former President Donald Trump and leaders of the Oath Keepers and other right-wing groups during its investigation and public hearings.  “So if I was the former president and many of his allies, I would be shaking in my boots seeing these verdicts coming down."  Are these verdicts a deterrence to such behavior or would these verdicts turn them into Martyrs?
Zelensky criticized Klitschko, Mayor of Kiev, asserting heating needs of Kiev residents were not met. Klitschko shot back outlining the number of heating centers and accusing Zelensky of manipulating foreign partners among other things. Is Klitschko, a potential challenge to Zelensky? The two do have a prior history of competition and opposing point of views on politics.  As a matter of background, Klitschko supported President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's opponent in the presidential election in 2019. But the war unified Ukrainians and pushed most internal political differences to the side.  The [energy deprivation](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/11/27/russia-ukraine-war-list-of-key-events-day-277) facing Ukrainians has renewed tensions between Ukraine’s president and Kyiv’s mayor amid a looming power crisis and the winter period setting in.  In his nightly video address on Friday, Zelenskyy said the Kyiv mayor [had not done enough](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/11/26/zelenskyy-criticises-kyiv-mayor-klitschko-over-power-cuts) to help beleaguered residents. “To put it mildly, more work is needed,” he added.  Mayor Vitali Klitschko on Sunday defended himself against allegations levelled by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that too many Kyiv residents were still without power and that centers that had been set up for them to stock up on food, water, battery power and other essentials were insufficient   Klitschko wrote on Telegram that hundreds of such centers are in operation, as well as hundreds of emergency generators, adding that “I do not want, especially in the current situation, to enter into political battles. It’s ridiculous.”  Klitschko, who had been mired in several disputes with Zelenskyy before the invasion, said the president’s allies had engaged in “manipulation” about the city’s efforts, including “incomprehensible photos” posted online.   “To put it mildly, this is not nice. Not for Ukrainians or for our foreign partners,” Klitschko said.  The Russian invasion in February has transformed Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy from a leader with sagging popularity into one of the world's most famous political figures. Yet before the war, Klitschko was better known globally, at least to boxing fans.    Even when the Russians were nearby, Klitschko never stopped working out of City Hall, a massive stone building in the center of Kyiv, surrounded by sandbags. He said in a recent interview with *The Sunday Times* that he's left the city just twice since the war began.    Is Klitschko, a potential challenge to Zelensky?    [Meet the mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, known as Dr. Ironfist : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2022/08/25/1114494063/kyiv-mayor-vitali-klitschko-former-heavyweight-champion)   [Ukraine’s Kyiv mayor rebuffs Zelenskyy criticism amid energy woes | Russia-Ukraine war News | Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/11/27/ukraines-kyiv-mayor-rebuffs-zelenskky-criticism)
Why does everyone despise the IRS and what alternative would there be? Frequently you hear people complaining about the IRS and calling them evil. This has resulted in them being continually defunded and publicly ridiculed. As a consequence they have become less able to perform their designated role, which seems to spark more hatred towards them. Overall I understand no one likes taxes, but if we didn’t have the IRS, what other alternative would there be?
What Should be the Government's role in the upcoming Rail Strike? On **December 9th**, railway unions are going to strike unless a deal is reached with their employers.   Four major unions, including the largest in the nation, have rejected it citing frustration with compensation and working conditions, particularly a **lack of paid sick days**.  All labor disputes in the railway industry are governed by a 1920s-era federal law known as the Railway Labor Act, or RLA. President Biden has asked **Congress to force the unions** into accepting the deal.   What Should be the Government's role in the upcoming Rail Strike? Should they force the railway employees to work under a deal that they voted against because of greater economic concerns?
Who will be Trump's running mate in 2024? After Mike Pence did not stop the certification of Biden's presidency like Trump wanted, the Republicans mostly resent him. It's clear Trump will need a new running mate. The obvious answer would be DeSantis but I think Republicans view him as too valuable of a politician to not do anything as vice. And after not answering whether or not he will serve a 4 year term as governor in the gubernatorial debate, it can be speculated that DeSantis is setting up a campaign for presidency.  So I've compiled a list of potential candidates who Trump may choose as his running mate in his 2024 run for office:  * Rand Paul - Rand is very popular with a lot of people. And I don't think the Republicans view him as particularly important (they way they do with DeSantis). The only downside is Rand is a libertarian and will probably disagree with Trump on some issues. * Ted Cruz - Ted is also popular in the GOP and isn't too valuable to lose. Also, the last name "Cruz" when voters see a "Trump Cruz" ticket could stave off the popular idea that Trump is a racist. Then again, Trump dissed him and the other Republicans quite a lot in the 2016 primary. * Tucker Carlson - he's probably not planning on getting into ACTUAL politics outside of commentating it but he runs the most watched show on cable news and is incredibly popular. * Charlie Kirk - he has actually worked very closely with Trump though also might not be interested in getting involved outside of being a commentator. * Candace Owens - having a black woman would be beneficial to stave off the idea that he is racist. Again though, I don't know if Candace wants to get her hands into real politics outside of commentating. * Larry Elder - This one makes the most sense probably. After running for governor in California, he shows he isn't afraid to get into the real politics of it all outside of being a commentator. He is a black man (staving off the racist argument against Trump). He is very well-known and agrees with Trump on mostly everything. Only problem is that he's planning on his own presidential bid and one time refused to be labeled a Trump supporter specifically (as opposed to simply a "Republican"). As someone in the comments pointed out, he might be able to play the 'adult in the room' the way Pence did. * Rudy Giuliani - Giuliani is still popular among Republicans. Back when he tried to run for president, he actually got a good amount of support. He ran the biggest city in the country - and I'd argue he did it pretty well. He is Trump's lawyer which might cause problems but he might be interested in this sort of thing. He has been there with Trump since the beginning. Both were former Democrats and then became Republicans. Then again, he's pretty old and outdated.  I don't know... I see problems in all of these picks but Trump has literally had beef with every single popular Republican at some point. Who is even left for him to choose?  \[EDIT\]  * Marjorie Taylor Greene - some of you guys in the comments pointed out that she would make a perfect pick for Trump. It may help re-instate the suburban women vote and MTG (as far as I know) agrees with everything Trump has said. However, she has also been associated with very far-right groups like America First by Nick Fuentes. She even attended AFPAC rather than CPAC. I will say this pick probably does beat the previous one. * Kari Lake - at first, in comments, I was pointing out that she didn't even win anything. But someone pointed out Biden chose like the least likable person with super low support in the Democratic Party and won. So who knows? Kari Lake is a good option for Trump. She agrees with everything he says and the two are alike.
Is Human being an unequal creature? I heard this quote recently of Lee kuan Yew "The Human being is an unequal creature. This is a fact and we start off with the proposition, all the great religions, all the great movements and all the great political ideologies say; let us make human being as equal as possible. In fact he is not equal, never will be"  It had me thinking. I guess in any rational society, the state should try to equalize opportunity given the unequal nature of human beings. Whether they be physical, psychological or difference in experience and pathway of life.  I was wondering what are your opinion on this quote?
Are officials elected from political parties still the best way to manage the res pubblica ? Governmental agencies and state owned companies are usually ran by managers, not directly expressed by an ideology/party.  Local and state governments are instead managed by representatives elected first on their ideology (through a party) and then based on their provenience or zone of representation.  Is ideology and party membership still the best way to define who can participate in the race to manage a state, country or municipality ? Shouldn’t a country be managed based on priorities and goals defined independently of a party ideology, eventually based on personal ideas but most importantly on objective needs ?
At what point does prosecutorial discretion become abandonment of duty? There are only so many resources to around to prosecute cases so they need some discretion.  And most would agree that morally some laws shouldn't be enforced even if they can't agree on what those laws are.  But there have been a few people lately who feel like, in certain instances, they are just not doing their jobs.
Compared to President Obama’s first two years, hasn’t President Biden passed more legislation and achieved more internationally, given his handling of Ukraine? Why doesn't he enjoy the same level of approval within his party as Obama did? Obama's greatest achievements in 2009-2011:  * Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) * Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010 * Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act  Obama's mid-term:  the Democrats lost six Senate seats, a net six governorships, and more than sixty House seats, the most for a mid-term election since 1938.  &#x200B;  Biden's greatest achievements in 2021-present:  * Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill * Inflation Reduction Act * American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 * Passed the *most significant* piece of gun control legislation in 30 years, breaking 30 years of federal inaction * Exposed Russian false flag operations in the days leading up to the Russian Invasion of Ukraine and  has successfully led the international opposition to Russia and brought such support to Ukraine that Russia has retreated and been humiliated * Biggest year of job growth in American history  Biden's mid-term: Had the best showing of an incumbent Democratic president since 1998, despite low approval ratings, and secured the Senate and the left with Republicans with a potentially unworkable majority of two.
What impact, if any, will Kanye’s 2024 campaign actually have? In 2020, he received 60,000 votes and was only on the ballot in 12 states. His 2020 campaign started very late in July and had a very small campaign staff. This time around, he is one of the earliest candidates to announce and seems to be much more serious about it, working with prominent far-right voices Nick Fuentes and Milo Yiannopoulos. He seems to be running to the right of Trump and in his first campaign ads, has been attacking Trump for failing to deliver on Christian conservative issues. To sum it up, how do you expect him to do in terms of vote-share and will he actually be able to pull voters away from Trump?
How do dictators stay in power with support from their forces and inner circles? 1- I know the dictators’ inner circles are brainwashed but how come not enough people did something about hitler?  2- How come the CCP is still ruling?  If enough people from the inside revolted they could take dictatorships down, no?  Is it simply because the inner circles and people are brainwashed or is there another reason to it?  3- I know if some people protest they get killed but why don’t most dictatorship forces refuse to kill at once?
Do the protests in China greatly increase the probability of a civil unrest in the near future? On November 24, 2022, a [fire broke out in an apartment building in Urumqi](https://apnews.com/article/china-fires-6a1b6902e6ccf87e064f1232045a2848), killing at least 10 people (rumor has it that the death toll may be as high as 44). It is alleged that the cause of these fatalities is because the draconian COVID-19 related lock downs, which lasted over 100 days in this northwestern region of China, firefighters were unable to get to the scene in time and it took 3 hours to put the fire out. The origin of the fire may have been electrical, and it burned upwards (as all fires do).  As a result of the (rumored) death toll and these comments made by the official, people got angry. [Protests broke out in Shanghai](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-63772365) and other cities, as well as on university campuses on November 27. Specifically, one of these protests took place on Urumqi Middle Road (to highlight the city where this tragedy took place). In a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnFQNC1775M), it can be heard very clearly that the protesters chanted, in Mandarin, "Step down, Xi Jinping!", "Step down, Communist Party!", "We need freedoms, not dictatorships!" These statements are extreme by Chinese standards because all protesters are aware that they could attract criminal charges of sedition, which can carry decades in prison for convicts.  Protests like these are very rare in China, especially since the June 4 Tiananmen Square Massacre, which saw the deaths of at least 2600 people (according to a [TVB news report at the time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRj7e3ZvEc0)). Chinese people were aware that if they protested, they would be harshly punished by the government. But now, as a result of the pandemic-related restrictions imposed on people for the past (almost) 3 years, some people are finding it impossible to continue living (due to them not being able to work and the government not paying them any benefits). One such protest happened [about 2 weeks ago in Guangzhou](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-63633109) (coincidentally, this is the place I was born and raised in). The context of that protest was migrant workers from Hubei (the place where the coronavirus was first discovered) were disproportionately affected by the pandemic restrictions. They were not able to work and the government did not give them food, and some companies took pity on them and donated food and supplies. These supplies were somehow taken by others who turned around and tried to sell for ￥25/package.  For additional context, China is going to experience [population decline](https://www.ft.com/content/008ea78a-8bc1-4954-b283-700608d3dc6c), which is projected to cut its population by as much as 70% over the next 100 years. This inevitably leads to a crisis in the social security system, potentially leading to all persons born after the 1980s to be ineligible for benefits after they reach retirement age despite contributing into the funds for a lifetime. This will lead to a large number of deeply impoverished elderly people struggling to survive by mid-21st century.   Given the history of violent oppression, do you believe that the probability of a civil unrest, such as civil war, or outright mass murder perpetrated by the state against the people, are greatly increased due to these nationwide protests? Why or why not?
11th Cricut heard the appeal by DOJ seeking to vacate Dist. Ct. Judge Cannon's order appointing a special master and her authority to exercise equitable jurisdiction in a pre-indictment case. Most pundits claim the 11th Circuit will set aside her order. Have the pundits called it correctly? A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit heard oral arguments on November 22, 2022, in the case concerning the legality of the appointment of a special master to review documents seized by the FBI from former [President Trump](https://www.c-span.org/organization/?137322/President-Trump)’s home in Florida.   The Justice Department is seeking to end this review and appointment altogether. The FBI executed a search warrant and seized the documents including classified ones, in August 2022.

Judge Cannon in her original order noted that although there was no callous disregard of defendant's constitutional rights, she took into consideration the status of the defendant as a former president and also found irreparable harm to reputation.

What would have to happen in order for the United States to enact a non first past the post voting system, such as ranked choice voting? This is probably a stupid series of questions but I’m not sure what terms to search for to find other discussions of the topic:  How can the United States transition to another voting system? Would each state have ballot measures that enact it separately? Or would state legislatures have to pass laws to enact it?   Is it possible for a national ballot measure or for congress to roll it out nation wide? Or would that require an amendment? Or can it not be done on the federal level and each state would have to do it independently?  When a state enacts ranked choice voting does that also apply to their electoral votes or just for state legislatures and congress seats?    Thanks for any elucidation you can provide!
Is it hypocritical for gun control advocates to have armed security? Saw this come up in context of this:      https://apnews.com/article/biden-gun-violence-colorado-shootings-f85b4b9a59e3852868950d797f79a351      And bidens remarks on banning assault rifles.

Disregarding the fact that no one is really against a blanket gun ban and having armed security means these people are trained to use the weapons and not some random guy who walked into a store and decided to buy a gun.
Is ethnocracy a variant of democracy? Consider a hypothetical example.  There is a country where there are residents of different ethnic backgrounds. Two large communities 75% and 25%.  The dominant community considers the country only "its own" and perceives representatives of other nationalities as uninvited guests.  The minority is oppressed.  The history and values of the minority are demonized. While the historical figures of the dominant community are exalted, even war criminals. If the crimes are committed in the name of the nation.  The main governing bodies are concentrated in the hands of the dominant community. There are representatives of the minority, but only completely loyal to the regime.  There are special punitive bodies aimed at discriminating against minorities.  Part of the minority is deprived of full civil rights.  There is a policy of forced assimilation. This is the official policy of the state. For example, education in the native language of a minority is gradually being discontinued.  At the same time, more radical politicians openly call minorities "outsiders", "temporary residents", "lice".  But all this happens according to the law, in compliance with all democratic procedures.  There are political parties that are considered to "protect the interests" of the minorities. But rather, they are connected with the business interests of rich representatives of the minority.  How does this correspond to the term democracy?
Norway government for larger countries Norway has the highest democracy index in the world. But they only have the population of 5.5 million people.   In fact in the top 5 democratic countries Sweden with 10.5 million is the most populated. Some cities in the world have more people than that.  In your opinion is it possible to execute a government model like any of these top democratic countries for countries like India or China?  Edit:I think I didn't ask my question correctly. What I meant is can a system like those countries be executed in populated countries the way it is done in top democratic countries?
Will Pete Buttigieg's close association with the consulting firm McKinsey & Company be a political albatross for him moving forward? Pete Buttigieg initially touted his experience with McKinsey & Company as a strength, however as the 2020 democratic primary campaign moved forward, he increasing distanced his association with the firm. Since then the public view of McKinsey has only decreased with a high profile scandals such as their role in creating opioid crisis and their connection to the rent price fixing app Yeildstar.   To add to this repetitional damage recent book 'When McKinsey Comes to Town' by Walt Bogdanich and Michael Forsythe outlines a larger critique of the organizations ethics and impact on the globe highlighting their role in eroding labour and human rights.   Moving forward will Pete Buttigieg be damaged further by his time with the firm and potentially renounce McKinsey altogether? As well in the future, will McKinsey become an 'avoid at all cost' employer for individuals that aim to run for office?
Is China moving away from hard infrastructure in Africa, and is that bad? I listen to [this podcast](https://player.fm/series/the-china-in-africa-podcast-108224/us-china-technology-competition-in-africa) a lot, they really seem to know what they're talking about.  In the linked episode and several others, they have basically said that the Chinese government has invested a lot in hard infrastructure in various parts of Africa, **but** that they are now largely moving away from this. **Is that true? Is that bad? Is it a big deal? If so, what should be done about it?**  * I'm in the US, but from what I understand there is still a great need for hard infrastructure in many parts of Africa, and still not enough local capacity to finance and build it. The hosts of the podcast didn't seem too concerned, but they were also focusing on other issues. * One reason that they gave on the podcast for this shift away from hard infrastructure was the limited borrowing capacity of many African countries (combined with the riskiness and slowness of these projects), leading them and their Chinese partners to look for quicker and safer investments in ICT and things like that. **Is that the main issue?** * I've also seen discussion about Chinese fears of possible backlash against social, labor, and environmental problems that are more common with hard infrastructure compared to other types of investment. **How important is that?** * This is all based on the assumption that Chinese hard infrastructure investment is (still) significant in Africa. This seems self-evident, but maybe I'm blowing things out of proportion. I'm not really sure of the magnitudes.
Why do we keep hearing about the "razor-thin" majority Republicans will have in the house after hearing nothing similar in 2020? It looks like Republicans are going to end up with 222 seats (maybe 221), which is the same amount Democrats won in 2020. However, not only did we not hear much about the slim margin in 2020, but Democrats were able to pass major pieces of legislation.  So why is the same number of seats being discussed ad nauseam now? Is it just because of what expectations were? Was there too much else to cover in the news this time two years ago? Is it some weird double standard? Does it have to do with who controls the Senate and presidency? Or are house Republicans that much more divided than house Democrats?
What makes Ukrainian invasion much worse other conflicts? Basically the title. There is many other conflicts where major powers were invading minor state under some pretenses, gunning down civilians and bombing hospitals, yet the public backlash was so much smaller.
What are ways in which the US can enact proper policing reform? One of the most unpleasant byproducts of the Covid-19 pandemic aside from unemployment, was the rampant violent crime which increased to levels not seen pre-pandemic. The country as a whole is still much safer than it was in the 70s, 80s, etc., but violent crime has gone up during the pandemic and has continued that trend in many cities across the country.   It's led to disillusionment both in the civilian population as well as, to some extent in law enforcement. In a recent news segment done by The Telegraph (UK News Org), on policing in the US, a chief complaint that many police had in the NYPD (which was covered in particular), was removal of things like qualified immunity, a higher standard of operation and more regulatory oversight when it came to criminal detainment, etc. This has caused police officers to grow frustrated and retire en masse or shift to other police departments where crime rates were lower, or where the crimes were considerably less violent and erratic.   Nonetheless, it seems to be a problem that hurts many Americans across the country. We do need our police, and they would be the civilians' first line of defense against any form of crime. However, what do we do when we have a police force that is growing frustrated and disillusioned...but for reasons that seem somewhat unreasonable (growing accountability)?   Is it police training that is lacking? funding? What do you think needs to be fixed?
Why do republican figures like Trump and Reagan get so much support from those that disapprove of deficit spending?  From experience it would seem that many of those in favour of more austere economic policies favour figures like Trump and Reagan. Often times I will here comments like ‘you can’t spend other people’s money’ and ‘democrats are running the debt too high’.   However from my brief research it seems that neither trump nor Reagan are actually large deficit hawks as is often thought. Instead they just cut taxes.   Trump continued on a trend of similar deficit spending to Obama and Reagan deficit spent far more than the average president.  So why do they have such a reputation for budget balancing?
Should the US use military action against Iran over Enrichment escalation to 60%? With Iran now beginning Uranium enrichment to 60% (percent of the Uranium that is U-235, a more unstable fissile isotope) should the US be strongly considering military action?  This looks like they are not turning back from their desire to get nuclear weapons and will not hold to the previous 20% agreement.
Do you think extremist views from both Parties cause an overgeneralized hate towards each other? On social media and the news media the hot topic seems to always be Democrat Vs. Republican. I always see hate filled comments from both Parties aswell: "All Republicans are pedos" "All Democrats are racist" "All Republicans want is violence" "Liberals are groomers". I see comments like these all the time everywhere. So I ask, do you think the extreme actions of a few on either side causes the overgeneralization of each party, thus creating unnecessary hate and turbulence in the masses? Do you think there is a way to unify the masses against these terrible people?
What would happen if the Republicans in the House of Representatives weren’t able to agree on a candidate for speaker? If the Republicans are divided a Democrat could be voted in as speaker even though Republicans hold a majority of seats, correct? At least in theory. And if that were to happen, could the Republicans take back the speakership at any time if some time later they find a candidate they can all support?
What do you think of the Zionist concept of "a state for a certain religion/ethnic group"? Do you think that members of a certain ethnic or religious group throughout the world form one people, rather than being members each of the society they are part of?  If so, do you think they are entitled to an exclusive homeland?
How can developing nations avoid the potential misuse of climate reparations paid to them by wealthier ones? Corruption exists in all societies and all countries, whether developing or wealthy, and it’s something we need to be aware of. Especially so when we consider *what* countries will get the money and *how* it will be paid.   In New York State alone there’s several high profile examples of unemployment  fraud in the hundreds of millions of dollars that happened when the state was flush with federal funding in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.   Taxpayers of one country that don’t feel personally responsible for flooding in Pakistan will be put out to hear their money was wasted by bureaucratic inefficiency and corruption. And if an opposition party finds out, the Republican Party in the US for example, and runs on pulling out of the agreement or slashing the amount of funding, then this was all for nought.
How will changing demographics affect Republicans? Specifically age. Here are the approx birth totals in the USA of people who are soon to be of voting age:  2006 - 4m births - most of whom will be of voting age by 2024  2005- 4m births - all of whom will be of voting age by 2024  2004 - 4m births- all of whom will be voting age by 2024  We’ve seen that young people either don’t vote or tend to vote liberal.   What does this mean for the Republican Party that approx 12m more voters will enter voting age? (Not to mention approx 1.5m boomers die each year).
Should members of Congress vote their conscience or vote according to the wishes of the people who elected them? When voting on the floor, Representatives defend their vote, give their reasoning, and ask members from the other party to vote in favor of the bill. The ones that defended voting against the bill do not say it was “because my constituents say so”.
What will a post-Trump american Right-wing look like? Would a GOP under Desantis just be a return to old Bush-style neo-conservativism? Or is it something Brand New?  I'm mainly interested in economic policy. As the democrats seem to be moving more towards progressive economics, will the Republican party remain "neoliberal"?.  Something tells me that a new Republican economic platform would feature calls for a return to the gold standard, since there seems to be lots of talk about that among consecutive circles.
Initial Ukraine War Phase-Thoughts on Treatment of Foreign Refugees ? I hadn't been following much events about Ukraine lately, until recent reports that apparently most large urban population centers are now Ukraine controlled. I think it's commendable how much Ukraine has, despite apparently receiving a high number of air strikes on a regular basis and Russia's effort to "call up" reservists to shore up his forces, has managed to turn the tide of the conflict.  But I couldn't help but think back to some early reports when the war broke out.  The ones where, apparently, refugees who were not Ukrainian in ethnicity but who were foreign students, were among other things not being allowed on trains leaving the country, having to form separate lines at exit points from other Ukrainians, and overall not being given the same level of help/assistance from aid groups at the border who were only helping "Ukrainians".  As someone whose own relatives emigrated from an underprivileged country to a western one, these reports complicated my feelings on this conflict in a major war.  So my question here being, do you think how they were treated (non-Ukrainian refugees) could have been done differently ?
At what point does climate action become more important than democracy? If we agree on the scientific community's grim assessment of our future should we fail to make the necessary systemic changes to avoid a climate catastrophe,  then we can agree that these changes represent an extremely urgent matter.   In the US, for the past generation or so, we've seen a deepening divide between our political parties, resulting in a total lack of cooperation on this topic. Even as the effects are becoming increasingly clear and present, even as our own governent puts out white papers using clarion calls of 'national security' to bring in the action-reticent Republican base, the roadmap to success remains gridlocked.  The tone of acceptance of our indecisive political landscape is everywhere. From a recent NYT article:  "...over the next two years, the Environmental Protection Agency is expected to put out three major new regulations aimed at cutting planet-warming pollution from cars, power plants and oil and gas wells. It remains to be seen whether those rules will survive legal challenges or a future Republican administration, raising the possibility that climate change will once again be a flashpoint in the 2024 presidential campaign."  My question to you all is, at what point does the benefits of democracy become moot in the face of climate catastrophe? When do we decide that for a crisis of this magnitude we need a new political landscape, one that can't rise from our current one?  Our "democracy" is a crucial part of our national identity, so the removal of democratic institutions in exchange for decisive climate action will be in essence revolutionary. As history shows,  this means bloodshed, perhaps chaos, and certainly a loss of personal liberties. It also means destabilizing our society, not to mention the global economy, with unpredictable consequences.   How does one weight these inevitable societal terrors against the threat of extinction?
If there are so many "progressives" who hate WEDs (wealthy established Democrats) like Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Hillary Clinton, etc., why do the WEDs remain the top candidates in the Democratic party? I remember when Bernie Sanders was running for president back in 2016, I asked my dad who is very liberal (albeit not an entitled asshole about his political views) if he was going to vote for him in the primaries. He said no, and that he was going to vote for Hillary even though he didn't like her. I asked him why, and he said "Because Bernie can't win." Well duh! Of course he's not going to win if no one votes for him!  Seems like the older folks on the left prefer the WEDs, even if they don't like them. But why?
Is there a historical example of a society entrenched in political distrust which, due to strenuous reform efforts has led to political trust? Think along the lines of Fukuyama's Political Order and Political Decay. A society that loses trust in government due to clientelism and patronage systems which erode or eliminate the middle class' access to political power. I'm sure there are other causes. What I care to know is if any reaffirm efforts have led to a turnaround.
Adam Frisch's concession speech In his concession speech, Frisch said, *"Democrats have abandoned rural America and working-class America for the last many years. Republicans have had a monopoly over the backbone of this country.”*  Is he implying that Republicans actually have done things to help rural Americans? Or does he simply mean that they do better PR in rural America?
What has happened to our politics? I’m sure there has always been some element of crazy in our political system, especially on a national level, but in the last decade, something has changed.   I don’t know if this can all be attributed to Trump, although, it’s fair to say that he has heightened what was already been taking place.   Is it social media and how we consume information now? Is it because we’re siloed off into our own echo chambers, and it being inconvenient to listen to the other side? Is it cable news, that has exaggerated conflict and political differences between us? Is it something else entirely?   Something seems to have changed. Politicians from differing parties used to call each other “friends” and “colleagues”, even if much of that was tongue in cheek. Now they call each other pedophiles and groomers.   There seems to be so much anger. So much division. So much hate. Bipartisanship has become considered a sign of weakness, even betrayal.   What has changed with our politics?
DOJ moves to appoint Special Counsel to continue its criminal investigation involving Trump to avoid any conflict of interest; given Trump has declared his candidacy and Garland works for the president [who may also run]. Will this move help weaken assertions of a Witch Hunt made by Trump & allies?  28 CFR § 600.1 provides various grounds for appointing a Special Counsel ...and includes— (a) That investigation or prosecution of that person or matter by a United States Attorney’s Office or litigating Division of the Department of Justice would present a conflict of interest for the Department or other extraordinary circumstances; and (b) That under the circumstances, it would be in the public interest to appoint an outside Special Counsel to assume responsibility for the matter.  [CFR-2016-title28-vol2-part600.pdf (govinfo.gov)](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2016-title28-vol2/pdf/CFR-2016-title28-vol2-part600.pdf)  White House was not involved and was not given any heads-up regarding the Special Appointment.  Garland concluded this appointment is in public interest for the continuing investigation now that Trump has announced his candidacy. He has appointed Jack Smith. Garland made reference that this is related to Trump and peaceful transfer of power \[Jan 6, 2021\], obstruction of Justice and national security issues.  It will now be up to Jack Smith to determine whether or not to prosecute Trump on one or more charges.  Does this appointment of Jack Smith \[special counsel\] give more credibility to any future prosecution of Donald trump?

Who is the future of House leadership? Nancy Pelosi has just announced her intent to step back from the leadership of the House Democratic Caucus.  With that and the tenuous hold Kevin McCarthy would be able to muster over the Republican Caucus, it would appear a significant realignment in the leadership of both sides of the aisle is either already afoot or in the process of occurrence.  With that in consideration, who among the House of Representatives could come to the fore to be the new leadership of either party, in the near, mid, and longer term future?  Who could replace Nancy Pelosi's notably strong and steady hand negotiating her Caucus, and who has any hope of controlling the Republican Caucus if McCarthy can't get it together or messes up royal?  And into the future, who could come forward to be the eventual replacements of the replacements?
How do human rights keep being defined in opposition to religious freedom? As the Respect for Marriage act advances in the Senate, it is striking that much of the conversation about the bill is built on the presumption that LGBT rights exist and are advanced somehow in opposition to religious rights.  As an example, one of the major negotiators, Senator Portman, made the following statement: "We've shown here through this legislation that these rights can coexist, religious freedom on the one hand, LGBTQ on the other hand."  Why do human rights continue to be talked about and defined in this way, one category against another?   Why is it not instead taken as a given that the rights of all people are advanced by being respected, protected and defended under our laws?   Even if one does not think their rights are being protected or advanced, what is it that anyone fears losing by the rights of others being protected?  https://www.cbsnews.com/news/respect-for-marriage-act-senate-vote-same-sex-marriage-bill/
What does it mean for the Republicans to have a slim majority in the House? Now that the Republicans have a slim majority in the House, what policy or legislative changes will happen in the next two years?  As for legislation, Democrats haven't been able to pass many bills into law because they don't have a supermajority in the Senate. Does losing the House change this at all?   Republicans in the House will now have subpoena power and committee powers, but few if any of their proposed legislation will pass the Democrat controlled Senate, much less the White House.  Is this just going to be a partisan investigation into Hunter Biden's laptops for two years until the next election?
Is it possible for the U.K. to rejoin the EU? I’m not asking the theoretic possibility, but based on the current political circumstances in U.K., is it likely for the U.K. government, maybe a new government, with the approval of people, to decide to rejoin the EU?
Is Florida getting redder due to migration of conservative voters? We've all seen that DeSantis is the rising star of the Republican Party, at least for the moment. His win in Florida was much bigger than expected. While I've seen arguments that Crist was a bad candidate, could it be that red voters have been attracted to Florida due to their lax covid response and culture war focused governance?  Particularly, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Arizona, Nevada, and Texas have all been trending blue, and it seems that that trend has sped up in the past few years. How likely is it that conservatives are fleeing those states for Florida in high enough numbers to explain their drift, as well as DeSantis's unexpected victory margin? Or is it more likely that DeSantis appeals to swing voters and former blue voters enough to rack up a 20 point win? Or did Florida Democrats really drop the ball to such a massive degree?
Who is a rising star among the Democrats? Who are the rising stars in the Democratic Party in the United States?  Who are the rising stars among Democrats who have a chance of successfully running for president in 2024? None of the potential nominees I can think of seems very good at this point.  Biden’s poll numbers are historically low for a first term president and he is getting up there in years; this makes him a mediocre candidate for 2024 but he will probably still run anyway.  Newsom has said he won’t run against Biden in 2024 so he is out.  Harris is even more unpopular than Biden and hasn’t had a stand out vice presidency with which to boost herself to stardom.  Buttigieg is quiet popular and really good at connecting with people across the aisle plus he is young which makes him a more ideal candidate; however based on personal conversations I’ve had with older people, I don’t think that the Democrats in the baby boomer generation are ready for a gay president. I think he would be better in 2028 or 2032 when gen z and millennials will outnumber boomers at the polls.  All the rest of the 2020 nominees seem either be too old or better positioned in Congress than the presidency at the moment.  Am I forgetting anyone? Who would you like to see as a Democrat candidate in 2024?
Does the student loan forgiveness have any hope of passing legal challenges, or is it hopeless at this point? The student loan forgiveness program is passing through conservative courts. It’s being held up by Trump appointed judges. Things are not look good, it seems.   Is this the end of it? And if so, why couldn’t the Biden administration foresee it being blocked so easily by the courts? Why did they not have stronger legal cards to play with instead of having 43 million filers on a legal and emotional tightrope?    And at this point, is there any hope left that it may succeed? Or is more likely going to blow up and ultimately be stopped in the conservative courts?   What is the likely outcome of the student loan forgiveness program?
If the election was “rigged”, will true believers go out and vote again? Trump has spent two years saying the election was stolen. It will be four years of that when 2024 hits, and according to polls a lot of republicans believe him. If this holds until Election Day, do you think republicans will show up to vote? Or will apathy consume them and result in a lower turnout because they truly believe their votes don’t count? Will this be the thing that decides the next election?
Can the House flip mid-term? What would that look like? In the current Congress, 6 members of the House died and 11 resigned. There were many time periods where there were multiple vacant seats, and one of the seats even flipped after a special election. It's not hard to imagine multiple (even just two) seats flipping, especially if those deaths are in more competitive places.  So if Republicans only get 219 seats, and two flip, what exactly happens? Is there a new vote for speaker? Is it almost like Democrats won in the first place just with a shorter term?  What if Republicans get just 218 seats, and two become vacant? Are Democrats with 217 in charge until the special elections?  How do absences play into this? Would a few representatives getting Covid mean power would go to Democrats for a while?
Is there any reason for Democrat's optimism with Moore v Harper on the horizon? There have been several things lately that are encouraging for Democrats. Despite losing the House, the midterms went significantly better for them than expected. Trump announced he's running, and many are assuming this is big trouble for the Republicans.   However, despite all of this, Moore v Harper is going to be decided by a Republican majority Supreme Court. This has a very real possibility of deciding elections independently of votes, either by electors voting differently than the results say they should, or allowing for such extreme gerrymandered maps that the results at a local/state level are inevitable. The public outcry at the decision is also likely to be limited, as less engaged voters don't understand the implications or understand them when it's too late.  Is there any realistic scenario where things DON'T swing strongly against Dems, despite recent optimism?
Trump and the direction of America  If Trump wins the Republican nomination, what does that say about the GOP? If he’s elected president again, what does that say about America?  There is great division in how Americans see Donald J. Trump. Some see him as an American patriot and direly needed savior to restore America to greatness on the world stage. Others see him as an unscrupulous and narcistic con-man. What do you think his impact on his political party and Americas future will be?  Is America at a crossroad?
Who is the AOC of the Republican party? And I don’t mean the republican twitter/reddit darling. I want to know who is a young popular over achiever member of the republican party, and someone you would consider AOC’s counterpart and/or someone you would want to see work together with her.
If Trump and DeSantis both run in a primary, what is DeSantis's strategy? What appeal does he make to Trump's base to peel them away? I've seen so many people argue that Trump is finished politically, but I keep coming back to the same question in my mind: what argument can DeSantis (or any challenger) in the primary make to not alienate Trump's base? What gives the base a plausible reason to prefer him?   DeSantis can't disparage Trump's policy positions. He's made his persona out of mimicking them. He can't disparage Trump's record. The party line is that Trump was a highly effective President who delivered on his promises. He can't even go with something like "we love you, you did a great job, but we need someone in 2024 who can win." Because he can't even say that Trump lost in 2020.   So if DeSantis has to stand on a debate stage and tell the audience "I agree with Trump on everything, I think Trump did a great job in the white house, and I'm not convinced Trump has actually ever lost an election"... what conceivable argument can he make to say, "but pick me anyway"?
What happens to the Jan 6th commission now? I have read statements from some analysts that if the Republican party got the majority in the Senate and in Congress, they would move to shut down the Jan 6th commission, essentially stopping what it was doing mid-investigation.   With the Senate likely staying with a Democratic majority and Congress likely going with a Republican majority, what does that do to the Jan 6th commission?   Follow up: Do you think the Jan 6th commission will have any substantial impact on the recently announced presidential bid from Donald Trump?
When does filing lawsuits during an election cross a line and become unacceptable? When the Democrats claim Republicans are "election deniers" and a "danger to democracy" they point to the election lawsuits filed by Trump and others who disputed the outcomes of 2020 elections, or the processes states employed during that election.  Yet there are multiple Democrats filing suits this season - Fetterman sued in PA, and Warnock is suing in GA, alleging the elections aren't being run fairly.  Joe Biden bragged in 2020 that he had hundreds of lawyers lined up to file suit in FL if he lost.  He was going to allege "voter suppression".  When does filing lawsuits cross a line from being a part of "doing business", to "denying elections"?
Moderate who could win role of Speaker of the House? Republics are projected to have a slim Marjory in the House in the next Congress. A number of those Republicans won in districts that voted heavily for Biden in 2020. If a few republicans were to defect who could a coalition of moderate republicans and democrats elect as the next Speaker of the House? I suspect it would need to be a well respected moderate republican and not a moderate democrat.
What does it mean for a party to be "run well?" I've been mulling this over for a bit but the thread about state parties pushed me to asking, what does it actually entail?  Again referencing the recent thread about state parties, I see a lot of answers that seem to point more towards election results than tangible effects. Obviously election results are the end goal of organizing a party well, but that doesn't explain how to arrive at election results. One comment pointed to a failure by FL dems to make inroads in the Latino community. Well what exactly would they do to do that, as an organization?  I personally can understand the idea of a campaign being well managed, and the national DNC makes sense to me in terms of mostly deciding which races to put money into, but that still seems very candidate dependent. What are the concrete actions taken by an organized party vs a disorganized one though, the things a party can do regardless of which candidates they have and are against, that would result in boosting all their election results?
What will be the larger consequences from Biden and Xi's meeting? Basically the title.  Things have been tense ever since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but they took a turn for the worse when China made subtle hints about conquering Taiwan.  What can we expect will ultimately come from [this meeting](https://www.biasly.com/bidenreadiesformeetingwithchineseleaderthatcouldhavelonglastingconsequencescnnpoliticscnninternational/)? Will the US policy change?
What's the future of US zoning laws/housing/transit development? This is obviously a very local type of thing.  We have seen an increase in the YIMBY movement in the last few years, but many city officials throughout the country are beholden to wealthy homeowners who do not want any construction near their properties. (AKA NIMBYS)  What do you think is the future of Zoning laws/Transit in US cities. Will US cities eventually densify and move past the NIMBY era, or will it be that way forever?
