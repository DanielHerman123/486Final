I am really keen to get involved with Green politics at a local level (I'm from the UK). The Conservative Party has basically wrecked out country, and the Labour Party (the only realistic alternative) are almost Conservative-lite, under the current leadership.  My priority now is to do what I can to preserve and expand the green space in my town; improve public transport; increase recycling; and preserve habitat.  The issue is that, for pretty much all my life, I've voted Conservative (I'm 33 now). I did so because I didn't trust Labour with our economy; and I bought the bullsh\*t the Conservatives peddled about the environment and what they were doing to protect it.  But, since then, the Conservatives have totally f\*cked our economy anyway - whilst enriching themselves.  I know I was a f\*cking idiot for voting for them, and I own it. I want to try and rectify this mistake - at least in part - by doing what I can for my local Green party.  I'm worried, though, that if I'm honest with the local Greens they'll just tell me to f\*ck off.  Should I be honest with them, and talk about my conservative background?Green expectations: Is the party finally breaking through in England and Wales?From Protest To Power, a collection of links to data and organizing resources to help organize a movement against police brutality and racismTo highlight the critical importance of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, Green Party of Florida & Green Party of NY convened, Forum on the Threat of Nuclear Weapons on 2nd Anniversary of the UN Nuclear Ban TreatyThe Green Party: 'We are willing to stand with people.

The good news is, there is a proven, viable way to end the two party regime, better represent the people, and put pressure on establishment candidates!  It's rank choice voting.  The current system does not allow for fair third party participation. No matter who someone wants to vote for, under the current system they are pressured to align *against* their least favorite candidate, or risk losing their vote. Rank choice voting would change this dynamic *overnight*, instantly allowing everyone to accurately represent what they want. It would destroy the two party system, and the establishment is terrified of it.  You, as an individual, can make a huge difference in voting advocacy. Rank choice voting is something that can be accomplished from the bottom up, starting in local elections. Individuals can make a huge difference because we can put pressure on our local government much more effectively than the state or national. And once something is proven to work at the local level, it is more and more likely to be implemented higher and opponents have less ammo against it. You can't argue that something doesn't work when people see it working in their own cities.Green will grow As a 19 Yr old student in Birmingham metro area I only see green party and labour.

Vote green because it will growThe Green Party As The Only Advocate For Direct Democracy The Green Party is the only political party that promotes direct democracy in our electoral campaigns and our platform. Direct democracy is the process through which the important issues and ideas that the Green Party supports can best be implemented. It is the putting into practice of our vision of a future society. A society that would be democratically run on all levels, especially the political, economic, and infrastructure levels.   Worker councils and popular assemblies, democratically organized in the workplace and local areas, would decide on public policies together. Worker, farmer, and tenant cooperatives would replace global corporations with sustainable local economies based on democratic decision making. These could then form trade associations for the purpose of industrial and agricultural specialization. Other methods of direct democratic decision making would include participatory budgeting, community land trusts, initiative and referendum, and police review boards.  A society where the collective good is prioritized by a real political and economic democracy would foster voluntary cooperation. A decentralized democratic society would minimize the layers of hierarchy which create inequality of wealth, so you have not only the freedom but also the resources and the ability to meet basic needs. Direct democracy transforms individual free choices into equally shared collective action. It demonstrates that individual freedom and collective benefit are not mutually exclusive. Direct democracy is the process where the methods of health or security or the social good is determined by the people themselves. The inclusive participation of direct democracy expresses the cooperative ownership of the society.  That is what the Green Party is fighting for.Local Pittsburgh News Talk Radio interview with 2022 Pennsylvania Green Party Candidate Richard WeissIn this Unauthorized Disclosure podcast, Matthew Hoh provides an update on his Senate campaign in NC.

The United States of America sits a top the throne amongst World's Nation when it comes cultural influence. The Nations cultural climate often guides the rest of the world and we see this today with more & more democratic Nations becoming 'duopolic' by human nature. With a Nation so diverse and a home for "all" - it is crucial us, Americans to uphold the model governmental style of our Founding Fathers, and continue to be a guide of democracy; not a democratic shell or the monster sworn not to be.  &#x200B;  First thing I'd like to ask you all. Where do you align? In America there are truly only 2 major parties today. Republican and Democrat. Why does this have to be? Why do we decide to vote for these 2 parties continuously?  &#x200B;  It was not always like this. In fact, it was George Washington's nightmare. Factions & coalitions have existed for centuries; yet the first major main stream divide in 2 opinions was the Loyalist & Patriots prior to the Revolutionary War. However the major difference in these early 'party' ideologies was one was for Independence; no longer representation vs one for loyalty to the United Kingdom; each step from the King seen as a step towards treason. However, when the war ended, Patriotism ruled the Nation. George Washington although considered an Independent. I would technically associate him with the nations only 'political party', the Patriots. This is because the ideology stems into the direct roots in the developed Constitution and precedents/bills set forward by Washington in his 2 terms, a promised prosperity of Liberty, Justice and Freedom for all.  &#x200B;  But he oversaw the steady division begin, with 2 major collations developing. Federalist and Democratic-Republicans.  Yet the benefit was this was limited to Washington D.C and somewhat internal; these parties often focused on minot details, yet they overall agreed on the foundation of the country. Yet, quickly parties became a regional talking point. This nightmare situation foreshadowed fears that stem from this very division. For the first time in the Nations history, men in charge tasked with servitude to the Nation placed interest in their OWN party interest first, over the Nation.  &#x200B;  With clear warning signs present at its greatest point during 1796. George Washington dedicated his final speech, now known as the Farewell Address, to his Nations people, a warning, a message and a set of tasks that crosses generations. A framework that must be engraved in all Americans minds and the rest of the world.  *(Washington describes parties as a spirit, this has devolved into the common term today, "Political Parties")*  [\[240\]](https://www.loc.gov/resource/mgw2.024/?sp=240&st=text) I \[George Washington\] have already **intimated to you the danger of Parties in the State**, with particular reference to the founding of them on **Geographical discriminations.** Let me now take a more comprehensive view, and warn you in the most solemn manner against the **baneful effects of the Spirit of Party,** generally  This spirit **\[Political Parties\],** unfortunately\*\*, is inseparable from our nature\*\*, having its root in the **strongest passions of the human mind.** It exists under different shapes **in all Governments**, more or **less stifled, controlled, or repressed**; but, in those of **the popular form** it is **seen** in its **greatest rankness** and is **truly their worst enemy.**  **The alternate domination** of one faction \[party\] **over another**, **sharpened by the spirit of revenge natural to party dissention**, which in different ages and countries **has perpetrated the most horrid enormities**, is itself **a frightful despotism**. But this **leads** at length **to a more formal and permanent despotism.** The **disorders and miseries**, which result, **gradually incline the minds of men** to **seek security** and **repose** in the **absolute power** of an **Individual**: and sooner or later **the chief of some prevailing faction more able or more fortunate than his competitors,** [\[241\]](https://www.loc.gov/resource/mgw2.024/?sp=241&st=text) turns this disposition to the **purposes of his own elevation, on the ruins of Public Liberty.**  Without looking forward to an extremity of this kind (which nevertheless ought not to be entirely out of sight) the **common and continual mischiefs of the spirit of Party** are sufficient to make it the interest and the duty of a **wise People to discourage and restrain it.**  It **\[Political Parties\] serves always to distract the Public Councils** and **enfeeble the Public administration**. It **\[Political Parties\] agitates** the **Community with ill founded jealousies** and **false alarms, kindles** the **animosity of one part against another**, **foments** occasionally **riot** and **insurrection**. It **\[Political Parties\] opens** the door **to foreign influence** and **corruption**, which find a **facilitated access to the government** **itself** **through** the **channels of party passions**.  \* **Thus the policy and the will of one country, are subjected to the policy and will of another. \***  There is **an opinion that parties** in **free countries** are **useful checks upon** the **Administration** of the Government and s**erve to keep alive** the **spirit of Liberty.** This within **certain limits is probably true**, and **in Governments of a Monarchical** cast Patriotism may look with indulgence, if not with layout, upon the spirit of party. But in **those of the popular character**, in Governments **purely elective**, it is a **spirit not to be encouraged**. From **their natural tendency**, it is certain there will **always be enough of that spirit for every salutary purpose.** And there being **constant danger of excess**, **the effort** ought to be, **by force of public opinion**, **to mitigate and assuage it.** A fire **not to be quenched**; it **demands a uniform vigilance** to prevent its bursting into a flame, lest instead of warming it should consume.  [\[242\]](https://www.loc.gov/resource/mgw2.024/?sp=242&st=text) It is important, likewise, that the **habits of thinking** **in a free Country should inspire caution** in those **entrusted** **with** its **administration**, to confine themselves within their respective Constitutional spheres; **avoiding in the exercise of the Powers of one department to encroach upon another.** **The spirit of encroachment** tends to **consolidate** the **powers** of **all the department**s in one, and thus to **create whatever the form of government**, a real despotism. A just estimate of that **love of power,** and **proneness to abuse it,** which **predominates in the human heart** is sufficient to **satisfy us of the truth** of this position.  The **necessity of reciprocal checks** in the exercise of political power; by **dividing** and **distributing** it **into different depositories**, and **constituting each** the **Guardian of the Public Wellbeing** **against** **invasions** by the others, has been **evinced by experiments** **ancient** and **modern**; some of them in **our country** and under **our own eyes**. To **preserve** them must be as **necessary** as to **institute** them. If in the **opinion of the People**, the **distribution** or **modification** of the **Constitutional** **powers** be in **any** **particular** wrong, **let it be corrected by an amendmen**t in the way which the **Constitution** **designates**. But let there be **no change by usurpation**; for though this, in one instance, may be the **instrument** **of** **good**, it is the **customary weapon by which free governments are destroyed.**  &#x200B;  **\* The precedent must always greatly overbalance in permanent evil any partial or transient benefit which the use can at any time yield. \***  &#x200B;  *- President George Washington, September 17th, 1776, Farewell Address*  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  So I ask you again.  &#x200B;  Where do you align? Why does this have to be? Why do we decide to vote for these 2 parties continuously?  &#x200B;  George Washington eerily foreshadows our Nation today. It is the duty of us Americans, and all others in a free Nation to ensure this behavior is avoided. We must refrain from petty arguments over obsolete issues, and focus on substantive change for the Nation, your Nation.  &#x200B;  This starts with. **STOP VOTING ON PARTY LINES.** Whatever we do, it starts with shifting the current stall-mate in our Federal Government. Vote for the **BEST FIT PERSON FOR THE JOB!** This starts at your local government! Push for an independent commission in your municipality. Start the hard conversations and find the best candidates for the positions. Ask those you feel align in your beliefs yet associate with a party to ask themselves the same questions.  &#x200B;  Those currently attached to Political Parties. Why? Your loyalty lies elsewhere, not with the Nation. It is too late now to "Solve the problem by joining it." All people see today is; You're a Dem, You're a Rep. Nobody just sees WE ARE AMERICANS. WE ARE HUMANS  *For those Religious, how can you be on the right religious path when your ideology is focused on that of man*  I guarantee you the public media coverage of large political figureheads stepping down from their party affiliation will push the issue into the public domain. And inside the Government it will begin a moral domino effect.  &#x200B;  Hypothetically now, enough Independents in the Federal Government or even State Level Governments allow for big changes in logistics such as 'party requirements.' I am not saying dissolve parties, but allow parties to be on a pure local basis, or a pure situational basis like the Revolutionary War. These parties should have no influence and be a symbolic voice however. You can not be a Party Chairman and hold public office. Standardization of elections can finally be made. This ranges from campaign funds, time on air, use of excess power.  &#x200B;  Ideally parties would just dissolve by themselves, and our parties are our voices. Your Voice.  &#x200B;  This is Individualism to the maximum but that is the democracy Washington dreamt of.  &#x200B;  A movement needs to start, and it would become the largest movement ever. The first Independent administration since Washington will come, but it takes YOU!  &#x200B;  Let's do this together.  &#x200B;  *Unity Creates Community*  *Division Dissembles Development*  *Don't be fooled by Parties*Dems vs. Greens (w/ Matthew Hoh & Dr. Jill Stein) on Bad Faith with Briahna Joy Gray (airing live now)SCANDALOUS: Dems Commit CRIMES to Keep Green Party Candidate off Ballot in N.

Everyone is talking about how the combination of Biden's visible age, his lack of pizazz, and a continuing trend of bad economic news is paving the way for Trump to return.  You also see plenty of [news like this](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/06/trump-ashli-babbitt-christians), which confirms that the right wing continues to grow in numbers and in anger.  When you add in the all but certain loss of Congress to the GOP in November, the takeaway is obvious: the Dems are on the glide path to a historic humiliation in '24, and a tide of genuine fascism will certainly come with it.  **The Greens** **have the power** to change the course of this election, but it will not come from waiting for the Party to pull itself together from the top down. We are a grassroots party. WE must organize our party into the force that is required to fight what we know is coming.

Here in upstate NY, our county chapters are engaged in a vigorous discussion about the prospects for the NY Green Party, as well as the current state of the party nationwide.     If you are a US Green, you know that our party is as tangled as a box of Christmas tree lights. But this state of affairs cannot be allowed to persist.     In just the last months we have been given many fresh warnings about what is coming down the pike in American politics: An attempted right-wing riot was barely thwarted in Idaho, Proud Boys are stampeding into children's activities in public libraries, the Texas GOP conspicuously threw gay Republicans out the door at their recent conference while publicly promising a repeat of the the Big Lie strategy for the next presidential election... and, oh yes, a bona fide fascist shooting rampage at a supermarket in Buffalo, NY.     **It is more important than ever** that Greens take charge of their state parties and make them functional, and just as important that they get them working and cooperating with other state parties.     Time is wasting, and the Greens cannot afford to be as aloof as the Democrats, who clearly do not see the writing on the wall.

I've been requesting access to the state party forum and the state party Facebook page for a while and haven't seen any movement on that for as long as I've been waiting. I emailed about the state convention and was told "there is no one that is going to do the party work for us," which i agreed with and asked about volunteer positions, to which i received the reply, "we simply don't have enough hands to do the work."  I've always been politically interested and wanted to participate in the party, but the idea my interest in help would be turned down because... not enough people want to help... was very confusing to me.  I've sent a second email about access to the forum and to the Facebook group again this afternoon but i wanted to share my experience.  I just want to see this movement thrive in this state but the nonresponsiveness I've seen from the state level is very alarming to me.

Now is the time for anger and action. Howie Hawkins, the Greens' NY candidate for governor, will be in Buffalo this Saturday, and I will be very interested in hearing what he has to say about the slaughter that took place on Saturday.  But we should also be aware that whatever he has to say will not be enough, because NOTHING that has been said or done about the ceaseless massacres that have been happening for decades in our nation has been enough.  We have to be aware that all that happened when the bullets stopped flying at the Tops supermarket on Saturday is that the clock was reset. The countdown to the next inevitable slaughter has already begun.   Only the slaughter is NOT inevitable. It CAN be avoided.  **I want to say that again: It CAN be avoided.**  Because the right words, the right concern, the right anger will turn the tide, will change the path we are on. And it is up to us, as Greens, to demand these words from our leaders, so that they can become our inspiration and compel us to take the actions that will hold the  people responsible for these completely preventable acts of violence accountable, whether they are celebrities, gun manufacturers, or politicians.  If you are a Green--in any nation--, you are obligated to contact the leadership in your state and local parties and tell them that this was your last straw, that you will not tolerate indifference or mere condolences from our opponents or our allies. This time, more must be done.
