How good can free market protect against protectionism? This has been on my mind lately. If we’re a country that is surrounded by protectionist countries, how can we win?  Of course there’s going to some export but it’ll be in the low numbers. But they’ll be flooding our market with lots of foreign goods that we essentially become a nation of importers and in time we’ll forget how to produce those goods and become dependent. This is as far as I can think of but can’t think how to fight back.

How would a municipality with zero routine traffic stops operate?

What are the alternatives to routine stops? Cameras and AI? Neighborhood watch? Share your ideas.
Questions about censorship? Why does it seem like most of the things I see, especially here, and on Twitter seem like "I support free speech, but only free speech that I support." I don't understand it? You would like it for people to be free to say things about topics that interest you, and ideals that you align with. But if the "censorship" or shit talking has anything to do with something that you like or support, then it's bad. I'm pretty sure that most people, especially here in Reddit and on Twitter wouldn't support "free speech" for a certain group or certain people that you don't like, or agree with. For example, anything right leaning.  I just got shadow banned from the "clever comebacks" sub for my "free speech." One of the people there went on to say "Free speech and the first amendment don’t apply to social media at all, genius. What are you talking about?"Are they fucking kidding or what? So it's ok for you to say "Black Lives Matter" and "All Cops are bastards" on social media, but when somebody says "Blue Lives Matter" it's bad?   Do you not see the hypocrisy? Also, all of this is happening in Reddit! Twitter! On social media! I'm getting censored for saying something that some mods or whoever didn't like. So, as a result, I got shadow banned! How is my case any less of a problem than what most people like to complain about when it comes to censorship?   I'm genuinely curious about why it seems ok to talk shit about some things or people or groups, but not for others. Like everyone here loves to shit on Elon Musk because they don't like that he owns Twitter. There were bad things about Twitter long before he got involved. It feels like a double standard but only against the right or far right. How is that fair to be so one sided? Sorry for the rant, I just don't understand it.  EDIT: I'm sorry if this is the wrong place for something like this. But, my submissions kept getting removed from every sub I tried to post it in. I come in peace, I promise. I'm not trying to be a dick lol

H.R.1525 - FAIR Act of 2023 Has anybody really done a deep dive into this? Listening to the author of this bill he said it’s going to redo how civil asset forfeiture works. While we can all agree that in its current form it is unconstitutional and incentivizes law-enforcement both monetarily as well as collecting assets for them to use for whatever they wish.  I don’t think the government will ever federally, ban civil asset forfeiture, but this sounds like a definite step in the right direction. I guess we’ll wait and see who is voting no on this, so we’ll have a good idea who is getting their pockets lined from the law enforcement lobbyist.

California judge signs search warrant to allow police to search an 11 year old girl's house over minor civil dispute (already settled amicably by private parties involved), kills her pet goat which was the subject of said dispute. Summary: Little girl raised a goat for over a year, entered the goat into a state fair auction.  Little girl, being a little girl, changed her mind and didn't want the goat to be slaughtered, mother and auction winner privately agreed to pay the auction winner back for his costs, and pay the auctioneers their cut, and was setting up a non-kill home for the goat to live in.   State Fair auctioneers refused to accept this, demanded the original contract to be upheld (despite losing nothing with the alternative), contacted local police comnections and the police got a search warrant that reads like a (already fucked) drug search warrant authorizing police to use "breaching tools" to enter the house and search for the goat. Cops then drive over 500 miles from their jurisdiction to search this house and eventually kill this goat.   https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-03-30/goat-slaughter-shasta-county-fair  EVEN using the justification for "normal" search warrants, which I already don't agree with fully, there was no risk of them hiding evidence or continuing to commit a crime, and there certainly was no risk to human life. Plus, the fair officials explicitly state that they were doing this to teach the girl that she can't disobey the rules.   There's now a 4th and 14th Amendment lawsuit ongoing, but this is so ridiculously beyond the pale that I don't know what else is happening in that county where dozens of people would think that this is normal or okay. Literally using a search warrant to carry out a power trip on a child.  I feel like at this point, after no knock raids and events like Breonna Taylor's death, and stupid petty shit like this, a law should be passed that house searches should only be carried out in crimes related to violent felonies.  And even then people need to get in trouble when it's overreaching.

I have failed to see how anything but a perfect monarchy could beat capitalism as the best economic solution, *however* I have observed that realtors, travel companies, resorts, and investors are all absent-mindedly selling off the beautiful natural resources America has in order to make a few bucks. I feel like the future is pretty dead and economic growth killed it. Like yeah let's make the economy boom, but not at the cost of our beautiful forests, hills, and waters. Tourism is especially painful to watch. It's not that I don't want the people to enjoy these things, it's that I rue the things they bring. Development, trash, housing problems, etc.  How can I approach being pro-free market with all of this stuff happening?

Thoughts on ticket brokers? On one hand they are participating in the free market by buying and reselling scare commodities. On the other hand they are an organized group who just 'gets on line first' to buy the tickets before other people can (e.g. casual fans) usually with bots and have no interest in going to the show themselves. They then inflate the prices and essentially add zero value to the whole process. Making them illegal would just drive the business underground.

Q: Is there a Libertarian case for any drug regulations? If there is, what is the dividing line between drugs that shouldn't be regulated and drugs that should be? Where for example would fentanyl be? I live in San Francisco where it's reported we average two deaths each day due to drugs, mostly due to fentanyl.  And there are plenty of youtube videos with fentanyl addicts describing how horrible it is to be addicted to it, and what will probably stop them is their own death by fentanyl.  Out of my own ignorance, I would imagine libertarian arguments to be that if all drugs were legalized, if the free market took over,  fentanyl would not be a problem, better drugs would be available and cheaper.  And again responding to that imaginary argument, I would think that could be true in some USA, but will not be true in this USA, not in our lifespans, and hence that imaginary response to my imaginary question, is not very good, it dooms us all to wait until some event that will never happen, happens.  What do libertarians actually believe, so I can stop arguing with the voices in my head?
Civil Rights Act of 1964 How do you feel about the portion of this act that requires businesses to not discriminate in whom they serve? I think that, besides medical institutions, private businesses should have the right to refuse/allow server to whoever they want. A business should be allowed to refuse service to whites, straights, lgbtq people, people of color, etc. if they choose so. Not that discrimination is right, I believe it is awful, but I think that businesses should be allowed to do so if they choose so. What do you think?

A call to all libertarian gun owners in Colorado. Colorado Gun Owners Call to Action  HB23-1230: Prohibition of Assault Weapons in Colorado  This bill will prohibit the sale and transfer of almost all semiauto firearms, including pistols, shotguns, and rifles as well as all .50 caliber weapons  or .50 caliber equivalents. According to the Rocky Mountain Gun Owners that's 75% of the firearms in the State.   The House Judiciary Committee is meeting tomorrow at 1:30 pm in the Old Capital Library to hear testimony.   https://www2.leg.state.co.us/CLICS/CLICS2023A/commsumm.nsf/signIn.xsp  Here is the link to sign up to testify. If you can please testify in person or you can testify on zoom. Or show up at the capital tomorrow to show your support for our 2A rights. The democrats need to see that they are hurting their own base and that Librals also believe in the 2nd Amendment.  EDIT: As of 5pm MST the hearing has been cancelled with no reschedule date. This feels like a political tactic to subvert opposition testimony but can't say for sure. Please stay informed, and be prepared to testify when it gets rescheduled. Also if you're in Colorado, Rocky Mountain Gun Owners do good work for CO gun legislation, so get involved.

Kansas Committee Passes Bill to Make Gold and Silver Legal Tender in the State
Why does government need the perpetual growth of economy? I'm start from afar. After researching this topic for a bit, the statement that "as population of the country is constantly growing, the economy needs to grow as well so that people wouldn't get poor". But I find a problem with this explanation and that is that the population doesn't actually grow naturally. It mostly grows due to immigration crisis and artificial inflation.   So we have the following picture: the government allows people from third-world countries to immigrate and then use social programs to possibly avoid working entirely. It obviously does it to compensate the lack of natural growth and also increase the percentage of people that are dependent on social security programs and government that allows them to not work. In return the immigrants spend money the government gives them (the money it takes away from working citizens) thus helping the economy to grow. Otherwise those money would probably be used for savings or stuff like that, and that is very bad for the perpetual growth.   Another thing government does to ensure the growth is 5-7% of annual inflation that abolishes the ability to save money and thus forces people to spend it on goods now rather that save it for later.   &#x200B;  So, my question is, what does the government gain from it? I have my thoughts, but I'm really not sure of them so I'd like to hear what are your thoughts on it.   Also, do you think we, as middle class working people, need the perpetually growing economy? If so, explain why.

It Turns Out That Hundreds of Banks Are at Risk
Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of a Vaccination Card So, I live in the mildly communist state of California, I'm 20 years old, and I just got a great job I've wanted for awhile. They require me to get Covid-19 vaccinations and a booster, which I don't have or want. Ironically, if I lived in Texas, I wouldn't need a vaccine at all. I disagree wholeheartedly with the recent mandates and crackdowns with Covid-19 from the past few years, and I've become so angry with the way the world responded to the entire "pandemic". I graduated high school two years ago on a computer in a halfway house in the middle of the desert in the palm springs area if that tells you anything about what it's like to be in my generation throughout Covid (I'm a recovering addict).  When the lockdown started I was very happy with the way that things were going. I had just gotten out of a group home and was excited to not have to worry about school and run around with my fellow drug addicts and cause chaos to my little suburban city. I dove into a crippling addiction to meth, fentanyl, and crack. I went homeless 3 times, overdosed 4, I went to 6 rehabs, and have seen a lot of those old friends die in my process of getting clean. I don't want to say that Covid-19, or the lockdown, or my state's policies "made me become an addict" because that would be a lie. However, I don't think it's a coincidence that the number of fentanyl overdoses have rapidly increased since the lockdown. I don't think it's a coincidence that methamphetamine has never been cheaper on the streets as our borders are practically unprotected under President Biden.   It feels as if government policies have been consistently stuffed down my throat for 3 years now; because of my addiction and growing up in general I'm just now beginning to form opinions on these issues. My point is that I don't want to get the vaccine because I feel that I have a right to refuse it as a citizen. I hate the fact that my job, after all of these near death experiences, after, after the pain of seeing my friends die, and trying to survive on the streets of LA... my source of income is contingent on a debatably dangerous vaccine for a disease that has killed far less people than the lockdown itself did. And if the vaccine were so important to the state of California, where were they when I was homeless? If I remember correctly, we were not given vaccines, we were given food stamps and welfare checks. Currently, even after getting out of that lifestyle, I'm ironically in the process of trying to commit forgery because I don't want to comply with this stupid policy. The government does not give a shit about people like me who want to get their lives together, and have no business on mandating this bullshit policy for someone like me. I am so grateful for people like Jordan Peterson and Ben Shapiro who have shed some light on this issue and just wanted to share my experience.

Are libertarians pro-union? A Union destroyed my grandpas company and his retirement, and they famously led to the American car manufacturers going under—but under “hands off” free market theory would they correct themselves or somehow end up making the economy better? Or are they in a similar category as monopolies and plagiarism—something that the government has to step in to promote Free market competition?
Banks, FDIC, the Fed, and Socialism Talks are happening about putting no ceiling to FDIC deposit limits to all individual banks for at least 2 years (insert "temporary government program" quote from Reagan here)- help me out here.   Isn't that equivalent to collectivisation of risk, therefore all actors in the system are now backing up the bad actions of a few with no consequence of singular action? Shouldn't failure be a required option in "freedom", as painful as it may be? Wasn't one of the lessons of 2008 about systemic risk of bad actors wielding too much market share?  Isn't this basically placing the banking system under a socialist style of management? The banking system becomes socialist - controlled and managed by the solely by the Fed, whose head and vice chair is appointed by the executive branch and approved by congressional majority  authority?  Is this a "checks..." knocked out from under the "...and balance"?  Where the market goes - so does policy?

Party Principles What is the principle that underlies the Republican Party?  I’d say there really isn’t one.  Big government, religion-based censorship, huge spending, authoritarian tendencies, no need for ethics, honesty, integrity.  Minimize freedom in many cases, except for complete freedom regarding guns, to the point of lunacy.  Similarly, what is the principle that underlies the Democratic Party?  They don’t have one either.  Huge government when it serves their agenda.  Massive spending everywhere despite huge debt which we just ignore.  Enforced speech, censorship, cancel culture, serious authoritarian tendencies.  But suddenly believe in small government with the Freedom to smoke weed, get an abortion, gay marriage.  It’s all over the place.  This is the reason Libertarianism has an advantage.  We actually do have a single unifying principle.  I’d state it simply: maximize individual freedom wherever possible.  The government should be used only for those scenarios where the “maximize freedom” solution fails.  This is where good people can disagree about the details, but the principle is solid.

Can abolishing minimum wage work in America? I've read that the only (DEVELOPED) countries with no minimum wages are Sweden, Denmark, Iceland, Norway, and Switzerland but these countries have high union participation rates, collective bargaining, and strong welfare states. Can abolishing minimum wage work to provide higher, market based wages in a country like America, where private sector unions lack members and participation to call for good wages? I support the concept behind abolishing minimum wage but I'm a little concerned about whether its implementation will harm the wages of american workers.

Vice Advertising Bans? The libertarian argument for legalizing vices such as drugs, sex work, and gambling is pretty clear: 1) Consenting people should be allowed to spend their money how they want and 2) People are going to do these things whether or not it's legal, legality makes things safer at least.  What are people's thoughts on either banning or limiting in some way advertising of these vices as a compromise to allowing them to be legal?  People will make arguments "this advertising is predatory so it's not real consent" and the ads provide something tangible for the anti vice crowd to rally around.  It just seems like without ads the anti-vice crowd doesn't get quite as worked up as they're not always thinking about it, I've been seeing a lot of negative reaction towards the recently legalized sports gambling here in NYS and I think the ads are a big contributor as they often get brought up.  I don't gamble myself but I am worried about us backsliding on this and gambling being made illegal once again, which I think would be a grave mistake.  I realize it's not the most libertarian take (shouldn't people be allowed to spend their money on ads?) but if that compromise allows us to live in a more libertarian society with long term legalized sex work, sports betting, and drugs I'm all for it.

Libertarian message of Netflix “Street food” Has anyone here watched the series “Street Food” on Netflix? I’ve only seen the USA series but I felt there was some distinctly libertarian messaging. They talk about libertarian themes like costs of overregulation and benefits of open immigration. The interviewees are all self made entrepreneurs and usually immigrants. The food is delicious precisely because it draws on multiple interacting cultures as well as individual creativity. What do you think?

What are the major contributors to loss of purchasing power? I’ve seen many instances where lefties blame “greedy” corporations, “late stage capitalism”, and the mega-wealthy for the wage gap and loss of purchasing power.  There may be some truth to that, but what are the major contributors to the loss of purchasing power of USA wages?  Thoughts on these, or others?:  Inflation from government budget deficits, overspending, fiat currency, etc. lowers purchasing power of the dollar.  Oversees labor and production, especially in manufacturing, are cheaper than US based production.  (Cheaper labor should lower the cost of goods and services for the consumer, and could be attributed to the rise in standard of living for people living in emerging economies, but harmful to the wages of US based labor).  Collusion between corporations and government to create monopolies and barriers to entry for potential competitors.  Government regulations that inhibit a true capitalist system.  Respectful and thoughtful replies welcomed.

The Thirty-Two Hour Workweek Act would amend the definition of the workweek in the federal Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. It would require overtime pay at a rate of time and half for any employee who works more than 32 hours in one week. It becomes cheaper for a business to hire more people than pay an individual for 40 hours of labor. Which, inneffect, would reduce an hourly worker's pay by 20%. Would likely not impact a salaried worker's pay as employers are not legally required to pay overtime for salaried emoloyees.

the automation question I'm curious as to what the libertarian approach to the handling of the upcoming "next industrial revolution" caused by artificial intelligence, which is becoming more intelligent at exponentially increasing speeds, is.  Artificial intelligence is already extremely smart and accessible. It is incredibly efficient at data processing and can already program a relatively well. In the future it will be able to replace most office workers and programmers who's primary job is data processing. This will leave many people unemployed. It could however, if handled correctly, be an extremely beneficial tool for humans by, for example, decreasing work hours without laying off employees. How do you think this will affect the economy? How do you want it to be handled, if at all?

This is a gigantic bailout, do not be confused by the governments wording. Functionally a bank and hedge fund are practically the same. When you deposit at a bank it is no different than investing in a hedge fund.  You get a return rate even though it is stupidly small, but it is guaranteed and you are allowed to withdraw whenever you like. They take your money and leverage 30x to do whatever dumb shit they want that regulators tell them is allowed.  A hedge fund will also take your money and leverage it 30x to do whatever dumb shit they want with less regulations.  The biggest difference is that 250k of your investment is covered through insurance. If you have more than 250k in a bank you should already know that the money can be lost.  What should happen is that SVB should have all assets immediately sold at auction, pay out the 250k from the insurance fund and whatever is left to the rest of the depositors.  If some random hedge fund went busto, is it fair at all that the government steps in and gives investors all their money back?  Not to mention a guaranteed loan to smaller banks is a big bailout by definition. Doesn't matter if the government says backstop or whatever bullshit they come up with, it's literally a textbook definition of bailout. If you were a smaller bank and realized you were in trouble you would have taken steps to mitigate the risk but now with the government loan you can continue doing dumb shit.  People complain a lot about capitalism and free market when in reality it is the government that is giving free hand outs to these big companies. Higher risk means higher rate of return but if the government won't let you fail you will always take higher risk and smaller companies can never compete with that.

Bipartisan Legislation Would End the Worst Abuses of Federal Forfeiture Federal law enforcement's standard forfeiture practice is to seize property and then make the property owner prove their innocence. Forfeiture notices refer indirectly to dozens of different federal crimes without saying exactly what someone did wrong. It happened to Linda Martin, whose $40,200 in home savings is in government hands.  But there is real bipartisan recognition that civil forfeiture is unjust and unconstitutional. A newly introduced bill would stop federal law enforcement from getting to decide how to spend forfeiture funds, end bureaucratic approval of forfeitures, and ensure property owners have access to an attorney.  More on Linda's story and the bill here:  [https://www.forbes.com/sites/instituteforjustice/2023/03/14/the-fbi-took-her-life-savings-but-wont-say-what-she-did-wrong/?sh=37fcccd55eea](https://www.forbes.com/sites/instituteforjustice/2023/03/14/the-fbi-took-her-life-savings-but-wont-say-what-she-did-wrong/?sh=37fcccd55eea).

When is war applicable? I've been a libertarian for most my life. As an economics student it makes the most sense to me. However, as I am as antiwar as the other libertarian, when do we need to go to war?  I only ask because when we say we stand for liberty and justice but certain countries deprive others of those liberties, when is it appropriate to step in. Like when certain countries limit women's rights or sell children into slavery or murder gays or lesbians, at what point do we say enough is enough?  Was WW2 justified? I don't want to police the world, but at some point you can't let atrocities take place, just wanted another perspective.
Stop blaming everything that goes wrong in America on the current leaders in power If you complain that the failure of the SVB is the government's fault, or a trail derailment is the government's fault then that implies you think the goverment can have power to stop bad things from happening or that they should have it.   We should be honest in holding the people to account who are actually responsible for problems and stop trying to centralize power to solve our problems. That is all.

$9.7 Trillion Dollar Government Spending in 2023 9.7 trillion-that is the estimated spending by federal, state, and local governments in 2023. That’s 40% of the entire economy spent by the government. And what do we get?! Trillions spent on pointless wars in Middle East, wasteful spendings all over the government from education to infrastructure, subsidies for college loans, government induced monopolies in healthcare that has deprived us from benefiting from price reductions happening in free market, … Almost $30k per every single man, woman, and child in America and still millions of people living in poverty.

Freedom and Egality the definition of Liberty is acting according to one plans without the interference from government as long as the action does not arm others freely.   Libertarians seek to maximize autonomy of choice and political freedom. And political freedom is  freedom from oppression, coercion or any condition that would alter one's capacity to act freely.  Because no one lives alone on this planet we all interact each other in the functioning Society. When resources are the ownership of a man directly that person acquire a certain level of power depending on the importance of his possession for the others members of a given group.  From that point on the relation of equality required to be free is broken because one depend on another in order to for security and food.  Libertarianism without a governing body in the market to pass law for workers is Anarchocapitalism  If no organization re-establish balance of bargaining power in the social relationship of the owner with the labourer. We get the return of serfdom because one person can basically decide to change  one economical condition from day to night.   The Logical argument against that would be tell the worker to move into a different company. As we live in the free market system are incentivized to provide the cheapest possible therefore if one organization decides to cut the salary employee the others would have to follow sooner or later in order. Cohersion between employers at the sest scale and corporation have always been existant.  Libertarian society have exist. In the past in Spain Anarchosyndicalist revolution of the 1930s were direct democracy and workers control of the means of production was introduced in the country of Spain. Some individuals obviously had role that provided them with more power than others. How did everyone make sure for the bureaucrate to not accumulate all the power ? Direct democracy were everyone vote is equal and temporary stance in a position of power like bureaucrate or  director of operation.  TLDR; Liberty and equality go hands in hands. human are always finding ways to increase their bargaining power and position and if no governing body is balancing this power inequality that made one's loss their freedom we are in a relationship of serfdom. We can all agree the feudalism was not the model of personal freedom or the libertarian paradise.  Interaction, debate and more activities that elevate the collective intelligence are encouraged.

Amash non-partisan angle If we take Justin Amash’s call for not being partisan seriously, do you all agree? - meaning, we all know the principles the libertarian party stands for. However, in the future if we have one or more elected representatives in power, it seems like the non-partisan take would be to work with both repubs and dems to strengthen whichever position is most likely to pass (obviously in the libertarian direction).  - the counter view would be to always push for our most extreme takes in a no-compromise fashion.

Are more Americans actually Libertarians? I’ve often thought about this question myself. I feel as though if properly shown the facts and researched more into Libertarianism, more Americans may feel as though they agree with the party platforms. From even personal experience I’ve found Libertarians are sometimes thought to be “extremists” or the “anything goes party”. However I feel as though if shown the facts and properly explained, more people may find themselves agreeing with Libertarianism. Just curious what other Libertarians think of this idea.
Why is it that in the US there is such a push against “authoritarianism”, and yet people want to “compel” other to do what they think is morally right, using authoritarianism? The whole thing seems like a conundrum.  Let’s say I come to the idea that “I’m going to reserve money for my family and neighbors when they get sick”.  I put away 5% of my earnings every month for this.  I’m being socially active and productive.  Yet some people say “there’s people all over the place that need money, you must contribute or be punished”. This is authoritarian.  Yet it’s perceived as a pseudo-morality being “we’re all chipping in”.   Yet, I’m already chipping in for society by helping my neighbor and family.  It’s true that others might not be chipping in, but who wants these people to chip in if they don’t love you??????  If someone doesn’t love you, or care about you, why are they expected to chip in?  Does it help their soul? If they have to chip in but don’t want to, it doesn’t have any moral feature of benefit for them.  It’s just an authoritarian measure

How should I respond to this? I’ve been debating a socialist on property rights, and they had this to say:  “If you have an ultimate right to property, that means that stealing is worse than a human being dying. In fact, by your logic it would seem, ANY amount of humans dying. If I have a button that, if pressed, prevents a natural disaster that would kill every single human on earth, is someone justified in stealing my button? I put my labor into making the button, so by your logic stealing it would be immoral. If human lives are always less important than property rights, then the world is going to end because I don't feel like pressing a button. I don't want to hear "no one has a right to my property because they want it" for the millionth time, just asserting it doesn't make it true, explain why your property rights are more important than someone's life.”  I have typed up the following response, but am a bit unsatisfied with it. Is there anything else you guys would add or say?  “You’re asking “should you steal a person’s property if it will result in saving lives?” This question is very similar to Dan Barker’s “should you rape someone if it would save the human race?” Not because being stolen from is just as traumatic as being raped (though trauma is very subjective and relative), but because both questions are essentially “should you do \*insert immoral thing\* if it will lead to \*insert good thing\*?” I would say no and that to suggest otherwise would committing a “ends justifies the means” fallacy. I’m not even necessarily opposed to the idea of someone stealing the button to save the human race. I just don’t think it should be free of consequences. Stealing doesn’t retroactively become justified just because it happens to lead to something beneficial. I am preempting you will say that stealing is alright in this case because the harm experienced by everyone on the planet is worth more than the inconvenience felt by the person being stolen from. Firstly, there is no universal calculus that can calculate and measure harm compared to other harms, especially since harm is very subjective and differs from person to person (what one considers an inconvenience, another person considers traumatic). To complicate your hypothetical, what if the person has a seizure if the button is pressed? How does their harm measure up against the lives of everyone else?”

Wanting there to be mass surveillance is anti-libertarian? I am from Mexico and as you know, there is too much crime and violence, there are robberies, assaults, kidnappings, extortions, murders and rapes. I think a solution to this is to put a camera in every corner of the country so that people are always watched and criminals think twice before committing a crime. Obviously I believe in economic freedom and individual freedom (abortion, homosexuality, drugs, etc) but wanting my country to be filled with cameras makes me anti-libertarian?

Honest question: what is the libertarian take on the use of US military against foreign organized crime using terror like tactics. Elaboration in body text. Inspired by recent calls for military mobilization against the cartels, but follow me on a hypothetical. Imagine if organizations with access to the same resources as the cartels were running a similar organized criminal enterprise, but was using violence and terror more frequently and readily inside the US, similar to ISIS or the Taliban at their worst. For the sake of the hypothetical, let's ignore the war on drugs or other externalities, I'm just trying to figure out if it would be considered a valid military mission from the libertarian perspective.

What's with all the complaints of neoliberalism, like healthcare workers in the Netherlands striking from low pay because of the gov slowly 'adoping' the US system? I've heard that with more competition, free-market healthcare would work fine, but it seems like there's always some issue everywhere that they attempt to privatize it. They say the devil's in the details. What exactly are the details? Not just in Holland but anywhere privatization's attempted. I think the UK's NHS has been dealing with stuff too, but some say it's mostly because of old people and some drug addicts overwhelming the system, corrupt admins and Tories making cuts. Maybe the Swiss system has a better public/private balance?

What professions, if any, should be required to speak English? Edit: Thanks for all the responses. I made this post knowing the Libertarian stance, no legal requirement. Unfortunately the only recourse I have is, well nothing.  Context: I work somewhere that gets deliveries on 53 foot enclosed trailers. We don’t have a dock so theres a specific way we have to have them park. Nothing crazy just they usually try to back in to our phone booth of a parking lot and we tell them to park on the street on the curb. Sometimes they have a machine that can be driven and they don’t have ramps so they have to call a flatbed tow truck.   Well when they can’t speak English. They get very frustrated when we say we can’t unload them there. They call their broker and they usually have to translate. Now it is my understanding that the DOT requires them to be able to “communicate in English” mostly for law enforcement.   So the question remains are there professions that should be required to know English or at bare minimum be able to ACTUALLY communicate in English in order to be able to perform their job responsibilities?

What are your thoughts on Adam Conover? Mostly know for his web series, Adam ruins everything, he’s been a vocal critic of American corporations and government for years, he recently started making videos on YouTube mostly staring just himself to basically vent about how corporations should be stopped and that the government should intervene more to bring the money this rich people hold back to to “us”  [here’s his most recent video as of late](https://youtu.be/ayrVYwoe-DY)  His does bring a lot of good points but I feel like he missed out on a lot information in the video that explains why things are different now, like for example how the Cold War influence the anti-big government sediment that started during the mid 20th century among others   So I’m curious on what you think of him and/or his content because I want hear from people with a different perspective and belief for Adam

Need help understanding the internet issue in the US. Hello there! Among libertarians it is often said that there is no such thing as a free-market monopoly. But weren't internet providers also in free market?   I am not an american myself and all I know about this story is that several big providers divided the country in parts where only one of them is allowed to provide internet service and thus most if not all of them started providing poor service with connection speed worse than in some third-world countries, while people didn't have any alternative.   If you are from the US or know about this issue, could you explain to me, how could that happen? Are there still no alternatives? I know you could count Starlink as an alternative, but what about more conventional options?

Runaway juvenile laws are counterproductive and generate a ton more harm than good. From personal experience I was a foster kid, I was "abused" and "treated" horribly in the system meant to protect and love me. I ran away at 15 and began working, but I was never able to truly escape all the arrests and juvenile detention time because I had to go to school with my work. At 17 I was set free, I guess because I was too old and inconvenient.   I really don't see the point of trying to return any teenager 13 or above, toddlers run away unintentionally, and teenagers typically have good reasons. Besides anecdotal experience, there are studies that show these laws do more harm.   [https://rhyclearinghouse.acf.hhs.gov/blog/2019/03/facts-and-figures-about-runaway-and-homeless-youth-0](https://rhyclearinghouse.acf.hhs.gov/blog/2019/03/facts-and-figures-about-runaway-and-homeless-youth-0)  \- A recent study found that 79% of homeless youth reported experiencing multiple instances of childhood abuse.[3](https://rhyclearinghouse.acf.hhs.gov/blog/2019/03/facts-and-figures-about-runaway-and-homeless-youth-0#_ftn2)  \- According to [Missed Opportunities: Youth Homelessness in America](http://voicesofyouthcount.org/brief/national-estimates-of-youth-homelessness/), around one in 10 young adults ages 18 to 25 and at least one in 30 youth ages 13 to 17 experienced unaccompanied homelessness within a 12-month period. This equates to an estimated 4.2 million youth and young adults in the U.S., about the same as the population of Los Angeles or the combined populations of Houston, TX, Seattle, WA, Washington, DC, and Atlanta, GA.  I know some common arguments are going to come in and I'll address them beforehand.  "What about lack of employment or schooling?"  Kids who end up in juvenile detention don't get schooling, or jobs either. They're locked in a vicious cycle of homelessness worse than that of most homeless adults. Homeless adults by far in the population are less than that minors because it's easier to get a job and lift yourself on your feet.  "What about kidnapping and sex trafficking?"  Most kidnapped people were not originally runaways, and what is considered sex trafficking has a very low bar, for example, if you were under 18 and gave a blowjob willingly to someone over 18 for money that's sex trafficking.

What do libertarians think of socialists? Hello, I am not looking to start argument or convert you I just wanted to ask some questions. I’m a socialist and my dad is a libertarian so I wanted to learn more about the two of our ideologies agreements and disagreements about each other. what do we like and not like about each other?(not to say I’d stop liking my father over politics, him being a libertarian just made me curious about y’all’s)  On my side I haven’t seen much hate toward libertarians and most western socialists probably have libertarian friends. me and other socialists I know of, see you guys as equals albeit slightly misinformed, do you guys think the same about us or do you guys feel more harshly towards us?  from my point of view it seems like the biggest difference between us is our positions on private property, where all socialists think it should be abolished but libertarians don’t think it should be abolished, do you guys agree that, that is the biggest difference or do you have bigger grievances with socialist?(by private property I mean the Marxist definition of private property, as property that can be used to extract capital, such as a field of wheat, don’t worry, we commies don’t want you to communally share your tooth brush and handkerchief lol)  What other things may you guys like or dislike about us?  If I may ask, if you are kind enough to respond, just answer with things you think most libertarians would agree with. I tried not to say anything that most socialists wouldn’t agree with in my question because of course, a Marxist-Leninist has very different opinions than an anarchist even though they are both socialists just as I’m sure is the same with X libertarian and Y libertarian having very different opinions despite being both libertarian. Thank you
Honest Question I got this quote from lp.org “Libertarians strongly oppose any government interference in your personal, family, and business decisions. Essentially, we believe all Americans should be free to live their lives and pursue their interests as they see fit as long as they do no harm to another.”  And yet the majority of comments I see on Reddit, or social media that claim to be from libertarians always goes something like “I’m a libertarian but wow the left is crazy I agree more with the right every day” and it’s just like a video/article about inclusivity to trans people or something like that. The right constantly speaks of not allowing of trans rights and as simple as not even considering a trans man can get pregnant like it affects their lives so deeply (which, who cares is my position), abolishing abortion, making sure marijuana (that doesn’t kill like alcohol) stays illegal, and yet no joke every libertarian comment says the left is insane.  Perhaps it’s taxation that drives libertarians more right, and that’s fine, that’s actual policy opinions, but all the social/cultural stuff seems to drive libertarians to the right even though on their party website that quote doesn’t seem to add up.  Why is that?  UPDATE: I read all the comments thus far (167) and I appreciate the input! Though I don’t agree with all that was said there were great points and I appreciate y’all’s POV of your stances, it was good to not just look at this from an outsiders perspective and get actual opinions from libertarians instead of just speculation about y’all.

East Palestine Chemical Train Spill Incident Genuine question for libertarians to consider. How can we trust corporations to do the right thing to update the safety of their vehicles, upgrade train rails, and protect the safety of their workers without regulation? The rail industry made billions in profits with a B. They could have afforded to take a years cut of profits to ensure the next few decades they were good, but instead, willfully ignored it. In addition, the rail workers were denied the ability to strike with their union for better pay, sick days, and safer working conditions since they’re such a vital part of the economy according to the US government.  The derail accident has caused massive ecological damage by killing off fish in rivers, killing peoples chickens, and pets. We got contaminated waters, and air isolated in the region. To add, there were pictures taking of a chickens eggs being produced much weaker than a weeks prior to the incident. If that wasn’t enough, we have all home owners in the area who have to suffer the affects because it is difficult to move locations, especially if you’re waiting for someone to buy your property, or you abandon your multi-thousand dollar to million dollar properties. If this catastrophe has damaged animals so much, I can only imagine the impacts on the peoples DNA over the course of time being damage and causing cancer over time.  TLDR; With everything we know about East Palestine, Ohio, how can libertarians defend deregulation of all markets when the deregulated train corporation resulted in the catastrophe we see today from simply ignoring all safety concerns? How can we trust a Laissez-faire corporation/capitalist owner to spend profits to prioritize the safety of their workers, equipment, and communities rather that profits alone?

A Way Around Qualified Immunity. I've Never Seen This Angle Discussed I listen to lots of Libertarian podcasts and read Reason Magazine cover to cover every month.   Qualified immunity, as it's currently practiced, is clearly a travesty.   That said, minimizing frivolous lawsuits is a legitimate competing issue.   In the vast majority of qualified immunity abuse I see/listen to, the action by the government, particularly law enforcement, is actually criminal.   The problem is that the prosecutors can't, or won't, prosecute.   It seems that a reasonable legal theory would be that a suit, for violation of rights, could go forward if the plaintiff could show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the actions of the government agent met all of the elements of a felony.   This provides the wronged citizen with recourse, while minimizing openings for frivolous lawsuits.

Serious Question: When can a person's Second Amendment rights be constitutionally limited based on the public's right to Life? For example: A 2A absolutist would say that my right to bear arms includes my right to stockpile C-4 explosives. If I live in a 16-unit apartment building, my C-4 stockpile could potentially obliterate the entire 16 unit building and kill everyone inside. I promise to be safe and, if an accident happens, I promise to take personal responsibility for my actions (but of course, I'll probably be dead.)   Can government tell me I'm not allowed to stockpile C-4?
I agree with almost 70% of the principles of libertarianism, however, I just feel that it's a bit cruel or idealistic when taken to the extreme. Is this really the case or am I misunderstanding some things? First, English is not my native language, so please don't confuse any possible grammar/spelling mistake with lack of education. Second, by extreme I do not mean Anarcho-Capitalism. I am talking about something like a limited government whose only role is to protect the individual rights, and does not provide any kind of welfare programs or public services, such as education, healthcare, or Social Security. The arguments I keep reading and hearing usually boils down to the idea that private institutions can provide similar and better services at a low cost, and that the free market will lift so many people out of poverty as to render programs such as Social Security unnecessary.  Honestly, though, I never really bought into these arguments for one simple reason: I am never convinced that poverty will ever be eradicated. Claiming that in a fully libertarianism society, everyone will afford good education, healthcare, and so on, no matter how poor they are, just reminds me of the absurd claims of communism, such as that, eventually, the communist society will have no private property, social classes, money, etc. Indeed, competition will make everything as cheap as possible, but not cheaper. Some surgeries and drugs will always cost hundreds of dollars, and no amount of competition will make them free in the literal sense of word.  The cruelty part comes if you admit the that poor will always exist, yet we can do nothing about this. That is, some people will always be unlucky to have terrible diseases that need treatments they can't afford, or who won't be able to go to a university due to their financial circumstances, and the government should provide no help to them whatsoever.  So, what do you think? Am I right, or am I just misrepresenting the facts? Or maybe the above examples are just strawman arguments. Just to make it clear again, I agree with almost 70% of libertarianism principles, and I'm in favor of privatizing as much services as possible, from mail to transportation to electricity and so on. However, for me education, healthcare were always kind of exceptions, and the libertarianism argument have never convinced me when it comes to them, especially when counterexamples such as Sweden, Norway, and Finland exists and are successful by most standards.

What's your (libertarian) opinion of universal basic income (UBI)? UBI can be thought of as a negative income tax  below a certain income level, beyond which you switch to a positive income tax.  A UBI has some advantages over the current system,  - It's simpler. The current system of the welfare state dealing with poor and underprivileged is a mess of subsidized services/in kind benefits/conditional transfers etc. This has the additional benefit of minimizing bloated bureaucracies surrounding these programs (efficiency) - It's not paternal, poor people are given the freedom  to do what they want with the money they receive (self agency) - Welfare has positive externalities (eg. both person A and person B can benefit even if only person A donates, as was argued by Milton Friedman), which effectively means the market alone is insufficient to provide charity (market failure)   "... We still have millions of people without comfortable retirements, without adequate health care, and living in poverty. Only a government can spend so much money so ineffectually.

Why in the libertarian party there isn’t much discussion on exclusionary zoning laws and regulations? I tried following several libertarian accounts on Twitter and what to me would seem like a fundamental issue in the United States a lot of people seem to not care or just brush it off. Exclusionary zoning laws creates an artificial housing scarcity which effects numerous ongoing issues we have here in the US. From poverty, homelessness, the environment, to inequality and systemic racism, and the economy.

Libertarianism is not liberal, conservative, neither, or both. In fact, what's considered liberal or conservative changes every decade and is very vague and arbitrary. Libertarianism is pretty straightforward (not arbitrary at all) and has never changed.  Some say libertarians are "socially liberal", but we don't like gun control, hate crimes, pandemic laws, ext. Also, some libertarians are pro-life.  Some also say libertarians are "economically/fiscally conservative", but we don't like our tax dollars being spent on a border wall, crony capitalism, or a lot of our tax dollars being spent on the military.

Palestine, OH I don’t know if a lot of people are aware of the situation in Palestine, OH as there is not a lot of coverage on what is going on. But, a train carrying vinyl chloride derailed. Causing a spill of all of the chemical. They decided to ignite a controlled burn of the chemical to prevent an explosion. By doing so they are releasing phosgene gas (a gas that was used as a weapon in WW1). The environmental effects of this event will be astronomical. Yet it seems that a lot of people do not know about this event. But, everybody knows about the UFOs that we are shooting down. I know the UFOs are a concern and a national security concern. But they are pushing that story to keep this train derailment hush.   I don’t even know what to think about all of this. Most of my life I have known that our government has issues as every other government that has/is existed. But this is unacceptable and I am truly saddened to see the governments handling of this situation. This past week has really opened my eyes to the lack of transparency from the government. I love this country and our people. So many people have and will make sacrifices for this country, and even with all of that the government will lie and push narratives to cover their own ass.   Rant over. Needed to get that out. Stay safe everyone.  Edit: Sorry this is East Palestine, OH not Palestine, OH
socialist friend basically shoots his ideology in the foot So, we were both drunk discussing socialism, and i said that one of the major red flags of socialism is the fact that  it wouldn't be implemented if there isn't an autuoritarian government in charge of it, and he said that it was true, and he thinks that way, but he ain't scared of the authoritarian socialist because is a dictatorship that he would aprove, anyway, just thought it was funny and made me wonder if more socialist are ok with the fact that any socialist government is an authoritarian one

Given that speech in the US is and should remain as free as possible. What are your ideas for a better educated, critically thinking public? What are some libertarian approaches to fighting disinfo?

The story of 2 neighboring states New Mexico, minimum wage $12, paid family and medical leave, generous vacation time, and very generous social welfare and unemployment benefits.  .  Texas, minimum wage $7.50, very low labor regulations and one of the least generous states when it comes to government help such as unemployment benefits etc  .  You would think poor people would be running from Texas to New Mexico, but no, its the other way around. Im from New Mexico and i've watched all the friends i grew up with move to texas for a better life. Im about to move to Odessa too for a new job that will double my income. The business friendly Texas system of low regulations and low taxes has attracted businesses to the state of Texas and allowed Texans to more easily open and grow their businesses, making Texas a huge economic success. Meanwhile in my beloved New Mexico our government has overregulated our businesses, and is making it harder and harder to open new ones.  .  What good is a high minimum wage when there are no jobs? We all move to where the jobs are, Texas. And we dont get paid 7.50/hr, we get $20+, because the government doesnt decide our wages, the market does. So growing up in New Mexico/west Texas has taught me that the best way out of poverty is not regulations and welfare, but jobs and capitalism. People prosper when the government gets out of the way

They got pretty upset when I mentioned that I built my 1100 sq ft house myself and spent less than half the cost than buying one and with no mortgage required.   I also mentioned that I was thinking of doing build-to-rents and that sent him off the deep end. He thinks renting to people is evil and that I was somehow taking housing away from people who needed it. Like.. no asshole… the house wouldn’t exist otherwise if I don’t build it to begin with. He then told me I should be building houses at cost for people to live in and that I was “over privileged” for even knowing how to build houses… wtf?
Other Options to Taxes What are some other effective ways for the government to get money instead of taxes?

Why do bans on sales/possession of items or of medical practices in individual states not violate the commerce clause? I thought the purpose and interpretation of the commerce clause was that only Congress has the authority to regulate something if it affects interstate or international trade.  States banning possession of an item that is legal in some states would significantly prevent interstate trade because you then cannot transport those items through those states (forcing you to go around them, or to not trade at all if there is a wall of states banning possession.) States banning sales could also affect interstate trade by significantly shrinking markets for items and by dividing the country (causing large gaps between where things can be sold legally, increasing shipping costs.)  By this notion, how are state controlled substance acts (at least for things that aren't federally illegal), bans on certain firearms or firearm accessories, bans on building new buildings with gas stoves, bans on medical practices, bans on medicinal mushroom spores, etc. not all in violation of the commerce clause?  I know that controlled substances are federally illegal but I was thinking about how my state has legal weed, but there is no way that I could legally buy things from any other legal state and have it delivered or bring it back myself, even if the feds made it legal.

Crime Squad: Episode 5 (real crimes, puppet cops)
Unions and minimum wage I understand that in traditional libertarian/classical liberal thought, unions would basically legislate wages for workers since workers banding together gets around the massive disadvantage a single worker would have in bargaining power. However, what is the libertarian solution for our current markets, where lots of labor is so unskilled (mcdonalds, walmart, amazon, etc.) that the employer can find someone new in a day? Doesn’t this significantly reduce bargaining power for the workers? Also it seems that unions even in other fields don’t always seem to do much for the workers and are often corrupt. Any way to increase competition in that field?

A Critique of Georgism
I know a few specific taxes that only contribute certain services, such as gas taxes being responsible for roads. With so many types of taxes out there do they all pay for specfic services or do they end up in some large pool of federal funds? I would really like to know more about this. Whenever I see an argument online about taxes it's always one guy saying "but we need police, fire, ambulance, roads and schools." I know enough to know those essential services do not require the level of taxation today to fund them but I do not know which ones are necessary and which ones are not.
Usage taxes only? Just a question I would like to discuss because I generally feel alone in this opinion. Taxes are always a sticky subject.  I vehemently oppose income tax and taxes in general but barring a fully libertarian government the question of tax remains.  I would personally advocate for widespread usage taxes instead of income tax. Sales tax, gas tax, toll roads, etc.  What are people's thoughts on this?
The new Jeffersonian manifesto. Thomas Jefferson for all his faults was right about a few things(which shall be discussed throughout) the thing he was right the most about however was the quote “The best government is the government that governs least”. The natural conclusion to this view was brought by Benjamin Tucker in saying that the best government was no government(Tucker called this view “Unterrified Jeffersonianism”). This post shall detail a new Jeffersonianism that I feel is the best way ensuring equality and liberty simultaneously.  The cruelty of wage labor and virtue of agrarianism:  Wage labor will always be at fundamental odds with natural rights and human nature, if the government were to have one job it would be ensure widespread property ownership making everybody apart of the petit-bourgeois. What Karl Marx failed to realize was that the only way to free the proletariat was to elevate them to petit-bourgeois. Natural rights guarantees every person’s right to property and this will happen by using the lockean proviso in an Anarchist society to guarantee every person’s right to property. I will preface by saying it would be best that all of this property be agrarian in nature as agrarian societies are naturally the most fulfilling. The best way to ensure liberty and equality is widespread property ownership in an agrarian society.  Market Socialism:   The best way to ensure economic liberty and equality is a form of market socialism. This market socialism shall include free labor unions not beholden to bureaucratic management of the government, completely free markets that the government shall have no business in, a rejection of central banking, and cooperative business ownership. While this can be achieved within the bounds of the government it is most in line with liberty in an anarchist context. This is similar to what Marx criticized as petit-bourgeois socialism which he associated with Proudhon but what Marx didn’t realize was that this socialism was more egalitarian than the scientific socialism he espoused.  Strategy:  The best way to implement this system and get rid of the government would be a system of nullification in the spirit of 1798, agorism that would only support democratic business, mass squatting in land uninhabited but owned by those elites and the government, labor strikes by free unions not constrained by bureaucratic management, and insurrection where need be.  Conclusion: While many of these thoughts are scattered and incomplete(to the point of me possibly doing a part 2), it provides a guideline for a new unterrified Jeffersonianism. Also this was constructed on a mobile device so don’t be to Reddit about my grammar. Share your thoughts if you want.

Reminder to Left Libertarians: It's impossible to redistribute the means of production without the force of arms comparable to an authoritarian state. You're all still filthy authoritarians Idiotic leftists like to regurgitate this meme "socialism is when the government does stuff" and that statement goes to show just how little they understand about their own ideology and general lack of intelligence.  They don't understand that the government has to do stuff  in order to enact socialism, it's like they expect to give an impassioned speech on the merits of socialism in front of all the capitalists and business owners and at the end they'll all applaud and cheer while giving away everything they own, when in reality they're going to have to violently take over every single form of property making a profit.  This is why every historical example of Socialism has always devolved in to an impoverished tyranny.  Now, the brainless counter argument leftists like to give is that "huuurrr duuurrrr capitalism relies on violence to"  expect the major difference is that capitalist violence is merely the defensive violence used to prevent thugs from waltzing in and claiming 'dibs', while like I previously said socialism requires the initiation of violence on any and all forms of property making a profit, one is clearly more violent than the other.  Now all the leftist cowards here will just whine and down vote while also deny soviet atrocities the same way holocaust deniers do for the Nazis.  But you've just gotta accept it, there is nothing liberating or prosperous when it comes to Left Libertarianism, at the end of the day you're all pathetically educated and just not bright, grow up and accept the capitalism as the superior system.

Is it possible to dissolve a county in the USA? Say a group of like minded individuals obtained seats in a local county board and they cast a unanimous vote to dissolve the county. This would mean a total removal of all local government and bureaucracy, liquidation of all government assets, firing all employees, ceasing all property taxes, dissolution of all local ordinances and regulations where it would basically become a "territory" of some sort within a state.  Is this even possible in the USA?
The Two Parties The other day I came to the conclusion that the Democratic Party is best understood as a powerful political machine poised to ally with the majority of corporate-media power to become the dominant political power in America. They are likely to build a highly regulated social democrat government system with support from entrenched economic elites who can adapt to and profit from that system at the expense of dissidents and small economic actors. They will probably increase speech restrictions while monitoring individuals activities and finances electronically on a level we can hardly imagine, but the Republicans will present such an awful alternative they will act as a welcome force driving majority support to the Democrats.  The Republican Party is best understood as a weakening political force with shrinking, but highly committed, support from certain geographic areas and corporations. They are positioned to become more violent, undemocratic and irrational as a victimized perpetual opposition party. Rather than offering a functional alternative to the Democrats' vision they will simply criticize and undermine it while drawing support from whatever groups suffer materially or ideologically from the Democratic Party's agenda. Through internal squabbles, Democratic propaganda and a likely increased alliance with bigots and extremists they will fail to gain sufficient support to win the presidency or control the House or Senate.  This has convinced me that supporting either party will feed into one or the other side of a struggle that could easily end in a Republican-led coup or Democrat single party rule given enough time and dysfunction. The only hope is that the Republicans completely reform as a viable modern alternative to the Democrats, something they have no indication of doing, or a new party rises to better challenge the Democrats.   I apologize for the long ass post, but I think this is important to think about. I really do think a third party is the best option, but I doubt the Libertarian Party or Greens have what it takes. Do you see a way the Libertarian Party could reform to be viable? Do you have any ideas about how we can prevent my prediction from coming true? Or am I just a crazy pessimist who worries too much (most likely option tbh)?
US intervention question... If the President swears to uphold, protect, and defend the Constitution  and his job is to defend the rights laid out AND the Constitution lists rights endowed to everyone, wouldn't it make sense that the commander-in-cheif should fight to bring those rights to everyone around the world?

What efforts and laws do you think is acceptable for the government to deal with invasive species? I think that the government should push for the creation of a market for wild caught lion fish meat and other invasive species. Similar to how the got milk. Only issue is making sure it’s wild caught. People start breeding them instead. I’m against laws that out law ownership of animals. I know some people catch invasive frog species and then sell them in colder states where they can’t survive in the wild. What are your thoughts
Gov Crimes Against Humanity - Fentanyl/Xylazine/Tranq [(1) Emerging drug 'Tranq' leading to amputations - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y02VSuntfFk)    This drug has taken over the streets all because the over controlling government needs to regulate the poppy. Not a single person would have necrosis or limbs amputated if morphine was legal. The only reason people do *flesh eating* fent is because they can't get heroin.   We need to stop the government, this is insane. This is beyond manslaughter at this point because this isn't about safety, this is about money. If it was about safety they would just legalize morphine again. They just want to make money through big pharma and keeping morphine regulated is how to do that. No country can join the U.N. unless they regulate morphine. This needs to change. Legalize morphine/heroin. Let people grow the poppy.   We are entangled with this plant. We have been living together for a long time. We evolved together. To take it away is abusive. There are opioids in mothers milk to help a newborn baby. People go through hard times that require them to use this plant/drug.  It's unnatural to not have access to it.  Edit: Buying opium should be a human right just like condoms and syringes.
Why is the Federal Reserve a problem? How should monetary policy be handled?
How the German Government is destroying private Investing and Wealthbuilding. This is a personal Statement with some philosophical views on how society and the individual in it should resonate. I'm writing this in Regards to the Law for Private and Institutional Investors in Germany which has been revisioned in 2018 by the Social-Democratic-Party (SPD) and the Christian-Democratic-Party (CDU). For transparency reasons I want to explain, that I myself am Mmber of the Free-Democratic-Party (FDP) (Our views are mostly concluded out of the "Classical Liberalism") and do act as a minor Figure in a Board for a Federal State of Germany in that Party. Before we dive in further, I want to apologise for spelling or grammar issues and I am happy about every correcting comment, I'll try and find this as a way to improve my English further.  The Laws for Investing in the EU in General are far more regulatet then in the US, there are benefits from that, but what it mostly does is forbidding the small individual access to Markets like the US (at least on an easy way.). This did happen far more after the Housing Crisis 2008 and the following Euro-Crisis from 2009-2013. In this time there where some Laws passed which generally made sense.    But in the last legislature, 2018 in fact, there where passed the entioned revision through the "Bundestag" in this there is stated, that every investor which is "Generating" Revenue through ETFs or diversified Funds has to Pay a new Federal Tax: Called the "Vorabpauschale" (You could translate that with "advance fee"). This Tax is determined in seven different Steps and I do not recount them here because this is not an investing feed. (For everyone who is interested in Details either way:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBKI29k4nIQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBKI29k4nIQ) (The Video is in German, unfortunately))  In simple Words im a young Man with an Investmentportfolio which concludes in no more than 6000 Euros, with Inflation going on and on without a real sign of stopping in the near future, the "Base Interest" which is determined by the German National Equivalent of the Fed (Deutsche Bundesbank) s growing with it.  The thing that I am basically trying to say is: I have to Pay 20% of my UNREALISED earnings to the State, which get another 26,5% if I REALISE!   This is an existential Problem for everyone who is trying to participate in the market to secure their pensions in the future (The German System is mathemaically screwed, so private prevention through the market is advised.). I am just devastated and don't know what to say anymore. While studying im trying to save some money and im Parking it in the Stockmarket, but with Inflation an the rise.  I could lose my whole paycheck only to save my Stocks from being liquidated for an advance fee enrolled by my own Government.  I am open for Discussion, thanks for your attention.  With kind regards.

Does being a "bad neighbor" when it comes to property maintenance violate NAP? Now I will self admit I'm not the most organized or motivated person around. I also have a pretty large anti authority streak in me. I own a house, and I specifically bought outside of an HOA specifically because I did not wish to be Lorded over. However, my neighbor is upset that my lawn and exterior is a mess (and NGL...it is). He is threatening to call the county to have it condemned because he wants to sell and claims it's hurting his value. I say tough cookies. My property is mine to do with as I see fit. I'm also living with no one else and have no intentions of selling. Who is right?

The vast majority of the US and Canada arguably isn't "stolen land" if we apply the principles of Lockean homesteading So it's a common claim amongst progressives that the territory of the US and Canada was "stolen" from American Indians. I think this is BS.   The Americas, especially north of the Rio Grande, were rather sparsely populated prior to European settlement. [Estimates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_history_of_Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas#Estimations) by scholars range from 1 million to 7 million for the land that now constitutes the US and Canada. It's safe to say that the vast majority of land was not occupied by American Indians, the vast majority of the land was undeveloped forests and grassland, not villages and farms. American Indians were not living on every single square inch of the land, far from it.   According to the principles of Lockean homesteading, resources can be claimed by combining them with your labor. This principle applies to land whereby land is claimed by significantly altering and developing it. Since most of the land was not developed.   Many progressives will object to this reasoning and say that land they used to hunt, fish, and gather was rightfully theirs. If they really, genuinely, believe this, then it just comes to down a difference in values and isn't really resolvable. Morality is normative.   However, I don't think they, or most people, genuinely believe this. Those who say think like this were probably just conditioned into being sympathetic towards American Indians and hostile towards Europeans. I think this stance would seem ridiculous to anyone if we took race out of it, let me give an example.  Let's say John is shipwrecked and washes up on an uninhabited island. He builds a cabin and farm on a small plot of land, and he hunts, fishes, and gathers on the rest of the island. A few years later, Jake is shipwrecked and washes up on the same island. He starts building a cabin and farm somewhere else on the island, far from John's house. John discovers this and objects to it, claiming that the whole island belongs to him because he hunts/fishes/gathers throughout the entire island. Jake says that it's his right to build a homestead there because the land is undeveloped.   Who is right? I'm very confident that if you asked 100 people on the street, most would side with Jake here, thereby tacitly accepting the principles of Lockean homesteading. Even if they don't know the term for it.   Discuss.

does Imperialism violate the NAP? Imperialism is a direct result of globalized markets. Wealthy first world capitalists buy out farmland and factories in small third world countries. They pay the governments to protect their property and ensure that the bulk of wealth generated in that country flows to them. All of this goes on without the workers consent. So this leaves these countries poor- without access to healthcare, clean water etc. This is why the countries that are the most resource rich tend to be the poorest. Along the equator and throughout the global south. I believe this is a form of violence. This system is enforced by the governments- and those governments are funded by multinational corporations.   So this brings up the question- do you believe the workers have the right to fight back? This typically takes the form of a Communist movement. Almost every third world nation (majority of countries in the world) have had some form of communist movement that rejects globalism and imperialism.   If your answer is no, they shouldn't be able to fight back- then how could you consider yourself a libertarian? Isn't libertarianism about letting people do what they want? And resisting violent oppression?   Countless times this has happened. When there is a revolution in these countries, the 1st world capitalists response is to fund a fascist coup in these countries to reinforce global commodity chains- to keep the profits flowing to them.   Call me crazy, but I think a country should produce for its own people. Not a single country in this world is content with producing for others and seeing no benefit. This is a parasitic and violently oppressive relationship.   Should they be allowed to fight back? Does global capitalism inherently violate the "NAP" ?

What is the general Libertarian opinion of the Land Value Tax (LVT)? (Also my criticism of the FairTax Act) I’ve been thinking more and more about the proposed FairTax Act being pushed by Republicans and how long it’s been promoted over the years. I notice a lot of posts on this sub praising the proposed FairTax, even though it’s an extremely regressive 22% sales tax that [raises the tax burden on 90% of taxpayers while only the top 10% receive a reduction in the tax burden](https://www.thebalancemoney.com/what-is-the-fair-tax-plan-pros-cons-effect-3305765#toc-studies-that-dont-support-the-fair-tax). And also, if we’re really concerned with purchasing power and cost of living given how bad it can be under big-government democratic policies, why are some on this sub so willing to let the price of goods across the board be automatically 14% higher after taxes (presuming current sales tax is roughly 8%)???  But perhaps my biggest question about the FairTax Act to Libertarians who support it is this;  **If we wanted to abolish the IRS and most taxes in favor of a single tax, why not go with the LVT?**   Unlike sales tax, it’s actually progressive and doesn’t need additional deductions or exemptions to make sure poor people aren’t unnecessarily burdened with the single tax. Also, [libertarian economists like Milton Friedman noted how the LVT is the most fair form of taxation that currently exists](https://www.econlib.org/land-taxes-the-return-of-henry-george/). Even if you disagree with other tenants of Georgism or geolibertarianism, why not capitalize on the LVT while you are marketing for a single tax?

Debate with leftist friend: Condensed version: My leftist friend says “The problem is that once you accept that liberty can be restrained if it is sufficiently "justified”, you have sacrificed liberty to preferences. Your liberty becomes just another trading card.”  Long version: I have an ongoing correspondence with an old friend from high school, who is a leftist.  He sends me “ah-ha” and “gotcha” problems, which I always find have already been dealt with by the likes of Mises, Hayek, Friedman, Sowell, the founding fathers, and philosophers etc. I realize that my friend is not asking in good faith; once I tackle his “gotcha”, he quibbles about definitions and semantics, goes down a hundred rabbit trails to change the subject, or does a pigeon on a chess board.  The only reason I entertain his questions is to broaden my own understanding of why I believe what I believe.  How would you answer this?

Main libertarian beliefs explained? So I've been interested in libertarianism for a while and think of myself as an old liberal but need some things ironed out.  1: Taxes 2: How to fund a government that protects the rights of the people 3: How to deal with monopolies in a free market 4: Treaties between nations and when it is appropriate for a nation to declare war against another nation.

Thoughts on using state ratifying conventions to abolish the individual income tax Should we use state ratifying conventions to amend the US constitution?  We could abolish the individual income tax with a amendment to the US constitution. What do you think?
What You Need to Know About Kosovo ft. Richard Cox | Ep. 243 Vital Dissent with Patrick MacFarlane
Hawks blow a lot of hot air over proposed budget cuts
I've been Disillusioned    Recently, I had a bit of an epiphany. Legitimacy, at least in relation to a government, does not exist. Governments are not "real" per say. Sure, there are buildings and people in those buildings, but those things aren't special. Those people only have power because other people say they can have that power, be it forced or otherwise. Government is a system that makes it's own rules, however the people in the system don't have to follow the rules, they just have to evade the consequences that other people might inflict for breaking the rules of the system. If enough people are breakings the rules that no one can instigate consequences, then the system falls into corruption. Then you have a social collapse.  TLDR  Governments only exist because people believe they exist.
Does Anyone Want to Participate In or Be A Speaker or Entertainer at the WA State Libertarian Convention in March? Is there anyone out there who wants to be part of the LPWA (Libertarian Party of Washington) state convention at the end of March?  It's a fun time of talking, games, food, drinks with some business and voting mixed in.  It is going to be held in East King County.  It is total of 3 days (Friday evening, Saturday all day, and Sunday morning and afternoon.  You will be able to buy tickets to any or all of the days.  Most of the business will be conducted Saturday and then fun festivities afterwards.  In order to vote you need to be a registered member of the LPWA (only $25 per year!) but you are welcome to buy tickets to the event regardless and just hang out with some fellow freedom fighters.  If you are politically active or publicly active in regards to upholding the tenants of Libertarianism and you would be willing to be a speaker (for 10 to 20 minutes) or engage in a friendly debate roundtable, they will most likely waive your ticket fee.  Also, if you have a band or you're a DJ or karaoke host or if you're a comedian and you support Libertarian ideas and you would be willing to perform then I'm sure they would be willing to waive your ticket, drinks, and dinner fee.  We are still working out details on pricing for each individual day but within the next few weeks tickets should be available on Eventbrite and if you would like to join the Libertarian Party of Washington for only 25.00, head to [lpwa.org](https://lpwa.org)     P.S.  We don't expect to win any major seats, especially with the machine slandering us and trying to keep us down at every turn.  But... I attended the last National Convention as a WA delegate and heard some of the most compelling and inspirational speeches I have ever heard in my life.  And I can't explain how good it felt to be in a room with a bunch of people who are well intentioned and well informed who all believe in liberty and justice for ALL.  Of course there are always some drama queens and squabbling here and there in any large group of people but the core tenants and message of this party needs to stay alive.    WE the people have to keep it alive for those who are politically homeless and need to find something resembling sanity to turn to.  Thank you for your time and I hope to meet a few of you at the convention!!

Strip searches and drug detection dogs in Sydney If you’ve got a minute, we’ve had a problem with police conducting strip searches at music festivals and other major events here in Sydney. We've got an election coming up this year and I’ve started a petition calling on the government to investigate the issue. The link is https://www.change.org/NSWPoliceStrip22 if you’re interested.   Back in 2001, New South Wales (state in Australia, Sydney is the capital) introduced a law giving police the power to deploy sniffer dogs at certain public locations, namely at major events such as music festivals, train stations and at venues that serve alcohol, such as pubs and clubs. No one voted for this but both major parties here supported it, so there was nothing anyone could do about it.  Fast forward to today and the dogs are a part of everyday life in Sydney. Every weekend you’ll have operations where at least half a dozen officers and a drug detection dog will randomly walk into clubs and bars and start sniffing patrons. Same deal at train stations. On any given day they’ll pick stations at random and you’ll have to walk past the dog with anywhere from 6-12 officers eyeing you off while you’re doing it. A lot of visitors from overseas seem genuinely shocked when they see this. Most people here just seem to have accepted it.  There are reports of people being stopped because the dogs have reacted to false positives such as food odours or prescription drugs. It’s not clear how common the practice is, but there are also reports of police dog handlers falsifying indications by instructing their dogs to sit, or by pushing on their dog’s backside or clicking their fingers to make the dogs react as well.  The biggest issue has been the presence of the dogs at music festivals. Back when they were first introduced, if you were unlucky enough to be stopped by one, the police would usually just pat you down and maybe go through your bag as well. It’s not clear when it started happening, but at some point NSW Police began using drug dog indications as a routine justification for conducting strip searches as well. We’re talking completely naked, squat and cough, spread your butt cheeks, guys lift your balls, girls lift your boobs type of searches.  At every festival, they’ll have a fenced off compound where these searches will be conducted. Depending on the event, a person will be taken into some sort of makeshift structure like a ticket booth or a tent. In other cases, they’ve been known to use partitions made from temporary fencing as well. Once the dog has stopped you, that’s it, you don’t have any agency or say in the process anymore. If the police want you to get naked there’s nothing you can do about it. Most of these searches don’t find any drugs either, and you’ve got reports of people being left crying, shaking etc after this has happened to them.

Cousin of Black Lives Matter Founder Dead After Being Tased by Los Angeles Police This story might blow it because it involves the cousin of a Black Lives Matter co-founder. Seems to me like the use of force was excessive even though the officer was using a taser. But he also had cocaine in his system. The toxicology report has not yet been released, but if it comes out that the taser caused, or contributed to, his death, it will be a huge story.

What’s in a Name? Why the Definition of Capitalism Matters
Does nobody else find it totally expected that politicians with no culpability have been holding onto classified documents stored in dodgy ways with no repercussions? All of Congress should be audited and have their home offices searched with the finding that the last two presidents are holding onto classified documents outside of National Archives approval. Why would anyone think that the members of Congress would be doing anything different?
Assault Weapons and Amusement Parks. So Illinois just passed a sweeping set of gun 'reforms' via HB5855 and SB2226.  Pritzger signed it into law.  Anybody else catch that SB2226 is an Amusement Park Safety Law?  They literally attached a copy of the gun reforms to an amusement park law as an amendment...  How the fuck does this make sense?  Am I over thinking it?

Read this and honestly tell me you trust them...  [FDA is Corrupt](https://www.reddit.com/user/DeadEndFred/comments/okzzjh/fda_corruption/) it is another fed agency bought out by the very people they are supposed to regulate  [Covid-1984 Requiem for a Scam](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/k9adfg/covid1984_requiem_for_a_scam/)  Rockefeller Syndicate and Covid-1984  Another good read here. As you can see so far the Rockefeller Syndicate took over large swaths of the medical industry a long time ago to peddle his OIL-based medications. Then used the power of the government he bought off to crush anyone who disagreed with the Rockefeller version of Health. It has only made us much unhealthier. There are much much better treatment options for many diseases that are being crushed because Pharma can't patent and profit from natural plants.  These posts are just on the Medical industry in America and the West. This goes FAR FAR Beyond just this industry. Everybody Fed Agency that is supposed to regulate an industry has been bought off. There is a revolving dooring between industry and regulators in Finance, Health, Environment, and the list goes on and on. For the best example of the capture in Finance watch The Big Short about the lead-up to the GFC in 07-09.  We have to get beyond the red vs blue teams or we are DOOMED and the uber-wealthy will continue milking taxpayers by using the "government" to do THEIR bidding. Both sides have their masters and we are left to suffer...  The people in congress who have been there for 30-40 years and have done nothing but make matters worse have to go. 3 decades and what do any of them have to show for it? Nothing. Each side stirs up its base by blaming the other team and behind the scenes, they vote to fleece us of our hard-earned labor. Each one selling their vote by adding more pork to bills no one reads...  We have to come together and work to turn this ship around or were in trouble they all seem hell-bent on starting WW3 now so please WAKE UP ALREADY. I'm trying to show you the truth while you soak in every lie the TV says
Where did the idea of small government originate? Hey all, I'm just wondering where the idea of small government, or even no government originated. I was watching Ben Shapiro on Joe Rogan and he seemed to intimate that it came from the founding of the U.S. but that seems kinda of far fetched considering the massive government that the constitution created. Was it just certain founders who were in favor of it or did the idea originate at some other time?  Thanks for reading!

Taxes. oh taxes.. I don’t know how anything works. What do big businesses get taxed and what do middle class americans get taxed? Why aren’t big businesses and industries paying all of the tax leaving lower class people to pay little to no taxes? Would that be a good thing? I could see it as a burden to big business not allowing them to grow and make better/more efficient products or services. But then this would be allowing more people to have money to put into the economy. What is the general opinion on this?
Libertarians Win With McCarthy's Concessions For Speaker [https://thelibertarianrepublic.com/libertarians-win-with-mccarthys-concessions-for-speaker/](https://thelibertarianrepublic.com/libertarians-win-with-mccarthys-concessions-for-speaker/)  I wrote a guest post for The Libertarian Republic and wondering what if what you think.
Why don't people get it??? Seriously I so not understand how people can't see the government over reach into our lives is what is causing issues.   Why do they think health care is so high?  -it is insurance companies and forcing things such as Obama care.   Why do they think college is so expensive?  -it is the same concept. If the colleges know the federal government will give out money to ANYone in ANY amount for college they will charge insane prices.  Why do they think that the government having access to any weapons but the people need to be restricted? -people are happy to sacrifice freedom for convenience.  How can we help people understand the government isn't our friend and needs its power reigned in?

What would the 10 Commandments be if they were based around libertarianism? Asked AI to write the 10 Commandments based on libertarianism in the same biblical language and here’s what it came up with. What do you guys think? Anything missing?  1. "Thou shalt not use force or deception to harm thy fellow man."  2. "Thou shalt honor the rights and property of thy fellow man."  3. "Thou shalt not speak falsely to thy fellow man."  4. "Thou shalt fulfill thy pledges and agreements."  5. "Thou shalt not take what belongs to thy fellow man without their consent."  6. "Thou shalt not silence the words of thy fellow man."  7. "Thou shalt not raise thy hand against thy fellow man in anger."  8. "Thou shalt not show favoritism to thy fellow man based on their appearance or background."  9. "Thou shalt not seek to dominate thy fellow man through unfair means."  10. "Thou shalt respect the independence and dignity of thy fellow man."
Now that McCarthy is speaker...

Is Amash's public standing improved?
Help prevent AWB in WA state! Washington State Weapons Sales Ban - Protect Minorities and the Working Class! Individual Activism Needed  For those of us in Washington state: Many of you already know there are now TWO bills on the docket in the WA House and Senate.  [HB1180](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1180.pdf?q=20230106112727) An "assault" weapon sales ban, and [SB5078](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5078.pdf?q=20230104123811) firearm industry member "responsibility" bill. Those links are to the bill text. Here are links to the STATUS of those bills in the process:   [HB1180 Status](https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?billnumber=1180&year=2023)  [SB5078 Status](https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?billnumber=5078&year=2023)  I understand many of you may be represented by republican members of the legislature and senate, but it is still important those members hear you early and often. As a former activist and campaign volunteer I can tell you it takes very little effort on our parts, and it is critical we mobilize at this early stage. Investors say it isn't about timing the market but time in the market. That is also true for activism. We can't think that this will be defeated in the courts, it just may never happen and even if it does it is **completely unclear** if it would beneficial.  If you reside in Washington, **ESPECIALLY if you are represented by a Democrat**, please follow these links and be heard.  1. [Go here to find your district.](https://app.leg.wa.gov/DistrictFinder/) You will need to enter your address. 2. You will have two legislators and one senator. You can click on any one of their names. It doesn't matter for this which you click, you can send them all the same message. 3. You will be redirected to a list of senators and legislators. click "EMAIL" 4. Fill in your info an email to verify your status in that district. Type in HB1180 and SB5078 and fill in any message you wish (don't threaten them, definitely be civil). 5. **DON'T FORGET** to click "oppose" as an option. 6. Click YES *"Would you like to send a copy of your email message to the other legislators in District X?"*  [Here is a list of Senators and their Olympia office.](https://leg.wa.gov/senate/senators/pages/default.aspx)  [Here is a list of Legislators and their Olympia office.](https://leg.wa.gov/house/representatives/pages/default.aspx)  If you can send paper letters to their office addresses listed in those links or call the legislative hotline (1.800.562.6000) and make a fuss, you will have earned extra credit.  If you don't think you're good at communicating (written or verbally), it's fine. Like Dad always said: "Keep It Simple, Son."   1. Introduce yourself very briefly (you are a law-abiding citizen!). 2. Tell them FBI and state statistics don't support the theory that Semi-automatic Rifles are not the problem. You know what is? mental health. education. political extremism and alienation. Semi-automatic rifles don't even account for 10% of the total weapons used in a commission of a crime. It's closer to 1%. 3. Politicians respond to incentives. Tell them you vote. You donate. Above all you **VOLUNTEER for campaigns, petition drives, and campaign fundraisers** and you have no issues doing so for any primary or general candidate that will tackle the real issues - republican or democrat. 4. Give them a way out. Tell them you can support them, even if they aren't a member of your party affiliation. Look, these people are paid 56k a year to start. They do this because they want to change the world for the better, not to get rich. They are reachable.  PLEASE share this any way you can. share it, take a screen shot, print and post it on your cork board at work, share to social media, whatever!
US Tax Confiscations in 2022 were the most as a % of GDP since 2001. Tax confiscations in Q1 and Q2 of 2022 exceeded 30% of GDP for the first time since Q2 of 2001. That is, the current receipts for local, state, and federal governments combined.  Current government receipts in Q1 2022: 7.5410 Trillion  GDP in the same quarter: 24.7405 Trillion  7.5410 / 247405 = 30.5%  And it was 30.2% in the second quarter.  The only other period in US history when taxes have exceeded 30% of GDP were from Q3 1997 - Q2 2001. The peak was 31.0% in Q1 2000.  I'm using data from the BEA for this: https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/?reqid=19&step=2&isuri=1&categories=survey  For tax data, click on Section 3 and then Table 3.1.
