What are the pros and cons of allowing a legislature to expel elected members? Recently, the House of Representatives in the US State of Tennessee [voted to expel two members for violations of decorum.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Tennessee_House_of_Representatives_expulsions)  One can argue over whether these members really violated the rules and whether the punishment fit the alleged violations, but the body's procedures allow for expulsion of any member on a two-thirds vote, so I'd like to set aside the specifics of this case and ask instead about the rule itself.  There have been cases of serious misconduct, including in Tennessee, where [the expulsion of members seems appropriate.](https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2023/04/04/tennessee-house-expulsions-history-legislative-members/70079648007/) Without that mechanism, how would a legislature sideline corrupt members and protect its legitimacy? How do legislative bodies in other states and countries handle it when one of their own elected members violates internal rules? In a democratic institution, when does the will of the body to expel a member justifiably outweigh the will of the people who elected them as a representative?

What are the arguments, for and against, President Biden’s 2021 executive order on the disclosure of ESG risks? In 2021, President Biden announced an executive order to build upon “[the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC or Commission) on-going efforts to develop a disclosure framework for environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risks, particularly climate change-related financial risk”](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/biden-administration-esg-activity-accelerates).

What enforcement mechanisms are available to the ICC when issuing a warrant? What is the precedent for issuing a warrant and what were previous outcomes? The Intentional Criminal Court or ICC states that they are  >The  Court is participating in a global fight to end impunity, and through  international criminal justice, the Court aims to hold those responsible  accountable for their crimes and to help prevent these crimes from  happening again.   >   >​​The  Court cannot reach these goals alone.

Mr  Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin, born on 7 October 1952, President of  the  Russian Federation, is allegedly responsible for the war crime of   unlawful deportation of population (children) and that of unlawful   transfer of population (children) from occupied areas of Ukraine to the   Russian Federation (under articles 8(2)(a)(vii) and 8(2)(b)(viii) of  the  Rome Statute). The crimes were allegedly committed in Ukrainian   occupied territory at least from 24 February 2022. There are reasonable   grounds to believe that Mr Putin bears individual criminal   responsibility for the aforementioned crimes, (i) for having committed   the acts directly, jointly with others and/or through others   (article 25(3)(a) of the Rome Statute), and (ii) for his failure to   exercise control properly over civilian and military subordinates who   committed the acts, or allowed for their commission, and who were under   his effective authority and control, pursuant to superior  responsibility  (article 28(b) of the Rome Statute).

The [State of Texas](https://apnews.com/article/houston-schools-texas-takeover-eae680bec5fbd3b419c2583fb850d42e) recently announced it will be taking over the Houston Independent School District (HISD), a move that started following allegations of misconduct by school trustees, including inappropriate influencing of vendor contracts, and chronically low academic scores at Wheatley High.

Is Florida's crackdown on drag shows and the targeting of Hyatt Regency Miami's liquor license legally justified? The DeSantis administration in Florida is [seeking to revoke the Hyatt Regency Miami's liquor license](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article273137760.html) due to the hosting of a Christmas-themed drag queen show, "[A Drag Queen Christmas](https://www.dragfans.com/tour/drag-queen-christmas-2022/)," in which minors were present. The show was held at the James L. Knight Center, a 4,500-seat auditorium affiliated with the hotel. State regulators claim that the admission policies allowed minors to attend the event, leading to their exposure to performers in "sexually suggestive clothing and prosthetic female genitalia."  The decision to target the Hyatt Regency Miami's liquor license has sparked debate over whether the administration's actions are legitimate enforcement of the law or a political maneuver targeting drag performances. This comes amid a [larger crackdown on drag shows](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/21/anti-drag-show-laws-bans-republican-states) that permit minors in the audience, as the Republican-led Legislature and the DeSantis administration intensify their efforts.  The legal filing can be found [here](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/23707305/dbpr-complaint.pdf).  In light of this recent action and the broader crackdown on drag shows:  * Is the DeSantis administration's targeting of the Hyatt Regency Miami's liquor license a justified enforcement of existing laws? * Are there any legal precedents or arguments supporting or opposing this action? * In particular, what constitutional arguments are there for or against this action, especially regarding the first amendment?
What are the policy implications of Covid-19 mortality rates? Tomorrow will mark three years since the WHO [declared Covid-19 to be a pandemic.](https://www.who.int/europe/emergencies/situations/covid-19)  Due to variations in methodology and the prevalence of testing, it has been [difficult to compare straight Covid mortality rates](https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/estimating-mortality-from-covid-19) between countries, but a strong case has been made that comparing [*excess mortality*](https://ourworldindata.org/excess-mortality-covid) (total deaths above expected) is [a good way to assess how different countries handled the pandemic.](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/07/excess-deaths-mortality-coronavirus-covid-19/)  [This page has an interactive chart to show excess mortality](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/excess-mortality-p-scores-projected-baseline) by country as a percentage difference.

Others visitors may select different parameters.  Based on comparisons of excess mortality between countries, what, if anything, can we tell about which policies worked and which ones failed? If some jurisdictions performed markedly better or worse than others, can those differences be attributed to specific policy choices?

How and why do US intelligence agencies draw different conclusions about the same issue? There has been some debate within the US intelligence community about the [origins of Covid-19.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigations_into_the_origin_of_COVID-19#United_States_government)  In August of 2021, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released an unclassified [summary of its findings](https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/Unclassified-Summary-of-Assessment-on-COVID-19-Origins.pdf) (PDF) saying intelligence agencies were divided on the question, with four intelligence community (IC) elements and the National Intelligence Council assessing "with low confidence that the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection was most likely caused by natural exposure to an animal infected with it or a close progenitor virus," one IC element assessing "with moderate confidence" that the first human infection was "most likely was the result of a laboratory-associated incident," and analysts at three other IC elements remaining "unable to coalesce around either explanation without additional information." Last week, one of those elements, the Department of Energy’s Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence, [updated its assessment,](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/26/politics/covid-lab-leak-wuhan-china-intelligence/index.html) shifting from "undecided" to "low confidence" in favor of a laboratory leak.  That's nine government agencies, all drawing their own conclusions about the same issue. The last source says there are a total of 18 government agencies that make up the intelligence community, all of which are under the umbrella of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI).   The ODNI was [created in the wake of the September 11th attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_National_Intelligence#History) with a specific goal to address the lack of integration and cooperation among the various US intelligence agencies. It was then [reformed in 2007 to improve that integration](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/Newsroom/Press%20Releases/2007%20Press%20Releases/20070913_release.pdf) and had its role [strengthened in 2008.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_13470) The [DNI's website](https://www.odni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/organizations) says its mission "is to lead and support IC integration..." and their [Mission page](https://www.odni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/mission-vision) says they do this by:  > ...effectively operating as one team: synchronizing collection, analysis and counterintelligence so that they are fused. This integration is the key to ensuring national policymakers receive timely and accurate analysis from the IC to make educated decisions.  So, what is preventing the US intelligence community from presenting an integrated and unified analysis of the origins of Covid-19? Does this issue present a particular challenge to ODNI's goal of integration?   More generally, is the ODNI fulfilling its integration role? What other issues, if any, has the US intelligence community been divided on since the formation of the ODNI?

What was the main cause of the poor performance of nationalised industries in the UK post WW2? Britain is well known for having a shift towards nationalisation and the creation of the welfare [state](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/mar/14/past.education). This included the nationalisation of The Bank of England, railways, heavy industry, coal mining as well as the British Leyland Company in [1975](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/277158/ep2-government-policy-since-1945.pdf) (pp.23).

But given the repeated interest, we've been putting up our own version [for the last few years,](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/sbn76h/biden_so_far_a_special_project_of/) so here is this year's version...  --------  There are many ways to judge the chief executive of any country and there's no way to come to a broad consensus on all of them. As of today, **US President Joe Biden has been in office for [two years.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden) What are the successes and failures of his administration so far?**  What we're asking for here is a review of specific actions by the Biden administration that are within the stated or implied duties of the office. Through the sum total of the responses, we're trying to form the most objective picture of this administration's various initiatives and the ways they contribute to overall governance. **This is not a question about your personal opinion of the president.**   We're handling this a little differently than a standard submission. The mods have had a chance to preview the question and some of us will be posting our own responses. The idea here is to contribute some early comments that we know are well-sourced and vetted, in the hopes that it will prevent the discussion from running off course.   Users are free to contribute as normal, but please keep our [rules on commenting](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_comment_rules) in mind before participating in the discussion. Although the topic is broad, please **be specific** in your responses. Here are some potential topics to address:  * Appointments * Campaign promises * Covid policy * Criminal justice * Defense * Economy * Education * Elections * Environment * Foreign policy * Governing style * Healthcare * Immigration * Rule of law * Public safety * Social issues (i.e., abortion, gun rights) * Tax policy * Tone of political discourse * Trade  Let's have a productive discussion on this question.
What evidence exists demonstrating the effectiveness of the Austerity Measures imposed by the EU and IMF in helping bring Greece out of it's 2008 debt crisis? In 2008 there began a Debt Crisis in Greece. In 2010 the county required bailout loans from the EU, IMF and others. Some of these loans required Greece to implement austerity measures. At the time these measures were hotly debated as to their effectiveness. In 2018 Greece exited the bailout program and some have hailed the project as a success.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_government-debt_crisis  https://www.cfr.org/timeline/greeces-debt-crisis-timeline  What is unclear to me is whether these austerity measures were effective in achieving the goals obtained to this point, and should they be considered effective in any future crisis.
What support, if any, do other states provide to border states? [Several states with different political views share borders with other states.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_border_states_of_the_United_States)  Currently there is attention on the Southern USA border with Mexico due to r[ecord numbers of crossings](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/why-are-migrants-crossing-us-mexico-border-record-numbers-2023-01-08/).  I'm aware of the existence of interstate mutual aid for emergencies and disasters and the use of EMAC, Emergency Management Assistance Compact, [allows states to request and respond to requests for aid.](https://www.mass.gov/service-details/interstate-mutual-aid)  I am wondering, what support, if any, do non boarder states provide to southern border states?
What factors account for the difference in the government's response to the Jan. 6 attack on the US capitol as opposed to the recent attack on Brazilian government facilities? On January 8th, [Pro-Bolsonaro rioters stormed Brazil’s top government offices](https://apnews.com/article/jair-bolsonaro-brazil-government-caribbean-0c03c098a5e2a09ac534412c30ae8355). U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez drew comparisons to January 6th, stating: “Two years since Jan. 6, Trump’s legacy continues to poison our hemisphere.”  My question concerns the differences in the US and Brazilian government responses to these actions.  For example, one of the differences has been that [hundreds of people were quickly arrested in Brazil](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/01/09/world/brazil-congress-riots-bolsonaro?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare), while almost no one was arrested in the US on January 6th itself, and while over [900 people have since been charged](https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/24-months-january-6-attack-capitol), that has been the result of multiple years’ worth of investigations.  There was also a difference in the immediate response as the [Brazilian police were described as “passive” in suppressing the protest, as opposed to the USCP, who tried and were overrun.](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/01/09/supporters-of-jair-bolsonaro-mount-an-insurrection-in-brazil)  So what factors account for the difference in the government’s response to the Jan. 6 attack on the US capitol as opposed to the recent attack on Brazilian government facilities?
What is known about the reasoning for so many rounds of public voting to elect the new House Speaker? And what is the reasoning for holding the election prior to House members swearing in? [Newly elected Speaker Kevin McCarthy had been the Republican's House Minority Leader since the departure of Paul Ryan at the end of 2018, and was House Majority leader under Ryan, before that.](https://rollcall.com/2018/11/14/kevin-mccarthy-elected-house-minority-leader-over-jim-jordan/)  [This term's House Speaker election required 15 rounds of voting.

Currently there is a [delay](https://www.npr.org/2023/01/05/1146841362/house-speaker-vote-struggle-100-years-explainer) and members have yet to [be sworn in](https://history.house.gov/Institution/Origins-Development/Oath-of-Office/). Once sworn in, House GOP members [indicated](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/12/08/house-gop-plans-many-investigations-next-year-senate-democrats-say-they-do-too/) their investigation plans. To me, investigations are different than policies/legislation so with this extra time, I'm wondering what is known about the policy goals and proposals of the new GOP House majority?

Can release of Trump's tax returns potentially lead to prosecution of people who executed it? Considering US taxpayer bill of rights provides for prosecution of people involved in unlawfully releasing taxpayer information  [https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/taxpayer-bill-of-rights-8](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/taxpayer-bill-of-rights-8)  "Taxpayers have the right to expect that any information they provide to the IRS will not be disclosed unless authorized by the taxpayer or by law. Taxpayers have the right to expect appropriate action will be taken against employees, return preparers, and others who wrongfully use or disclose taxpayer return information."  EDIT: correction: the IRS taxpayer bill of rights quoted above is an internal IRS document that does not apply to congress. However the right to confidentiality it refers to was implemented in 1976 Tax Reform Act which is an actual bill https://www.congress.gov/bill/94th-congress/house-bill/10612  Which "Makes tax returns and return information confidential, and provides that, except as permitted by this title, no officer or employee of the United States, any State, or any other person shall disclose any return or return information in connection with his duties under this title."  &#x200B;  And considering Trump's tax returns were released not as part of a legal framework (e.g. some new law making returns of presidents or presidential candidates automatically public), but as part of a House committee vote on dealing with this specific information https://edition.cnn.com/2022/12/20/politics/house-trump-tax-returns/index.html  Is there a potential criminal or other liability for people involved in releasing these tax returns?

New York Cities' Mayor Eric Adams [directed the police and emergency medical workers to hospitalize people they deemed too mentally ill to care for themselves, even if they posed no threat to others](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/29/nyregion/nyc-mentally-ill-involuntary-custody.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare)  This forced removal has been [decried by advocacy groups as a violation of rights?](https://www.ktvu.com/news/homeless-advocates-say-court-ordered-mental-health-treatment-violates-civil-rights)  What evidence supports Mayor Adam's assertion that this could reduce crime and overall rates of homelessness?
What is the current status of national nuclear power programs? What proposals are being considered? As another winter approaches in the EU and experts warn that the [energy crisis could last for years](https://www.ft.com/content/6c0b645f-2507-4b85-8c15-9b660adad324) countries like [France are keeping nuclear reactors online](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/12/15/the-french-exception) despite massive budget overruns, maintenance issues and in some cases plants not even generating electricity.   Nuclear seems like a good solution however how what policies help France fix these ongoing issues? What has shown to work for programs in other countries?
What is known about the effects to a nation's defense industry once they join a military alliance? [Sweden is in negotiations to join NATO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden%E2%80%93NATO_relations#Membership_timeline), although [they do already cooperate to some extent](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_52535.htm).  * In the past, I have seen claims that Sweden's defense industry does certain things differently from those in NATO countries (examples [here](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/europe/industry-se.htm), [here](https://breakingdefense.com/2022/11/made-to-take-on-russia-swedish-gripen-fighter-jets-should-go-to-ukraine-report/)). * As I understand it, [NATO encourages or requires lots of standardization and interoperability](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_69269.htm) among its members.  So I have three questions:  1. **Are there comparable past cases of a country with a large defense industry joining a military alliance, and what were the effects on those countries' defense industries?** 2. **Are there comparable past cases of big defense systems trying to integrate into even bigger systems? What were the effects?** 3. **Have credible sources made predictions of what might happen to Sweden's defense industry if Sweden joins NATO? What have they predicted?**  When I refer to "effects" on defense industries or defense systems, I'm especially interested in the effects on the resiliency of those industries/systems.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  Thanks to mod u/canekicker for being very nice and thorough to help me make this post neutral enough and not too rambly.
Is there a precedent for US state legislatures to take action that can bypass assertions by the state courts that such actions violate their own state constitution? If so, what was the outcome? The Supreme Court is currently hearing a case where North Carolina’s Republican legislative leaders are claiming that state lawmakers throughout the country could have exclusive authority to structure elections, even if their State court has ruled that they are violating voter protections enshrined in their State constitutions.  Without speculating on the outcome of [Moore v Harper](https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/moore-v-harper-2/), that led me to wonder:  * Is there precedent for US state legislatures to take action that can bypass assertions by the state courts that such actions violate their own state constitution? If so, what was the outcome? * Given that the NC legislatures all swore to ["endeavor to support, maintain and defend the Constitution of said State"](https://www.ncleg.gov/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/ByChapter/Chapter_11.pdf). And presumably legislatures in other states swear a similar oath regarding their state constitutions. Have any state legislative members ever been found to have violated their oath? And if so, what were the consequences?

How is the spending on state projects (especially by opaque governments) for things like the FIFA World Cup estimated? What can it be meaningfully compared to? According to Bloomberg:  > The 2022 football World Cup gets underway Sunday, with hosts Qatar taking on Ecuador. In the 12 years since the tiny gas-rich country was awarded rights to the event, it has spent $300 billion preparing for kickoff. Doha has been transformed, with the capital now dotted with new stadiums and hotels built to accommodate more than a million fans over the next month.  https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2022-what-qatar-built-for-the-world-cup/  Front Office Sports claims $220 billion  https://frontofficesports.com/the-most-expensive-world-cup-in-history/  However, the World Bank claims that Qatar's GDP peaked in 2014 at $206 billion and that it was $168 billion, when Qatar's rights to host the cup was announced, in 2011. Even the lower figure, $220 billion, would be an average of 11.5% GDP invested in the project, each year. Is that plausible?  https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?end=2021&locations=QA&start=2011  Much of the infrastructure may have been built anyway, but what is the best counter-factual infrastructure plan for comparison? What other state projects can these sorts of investments be compared to?
How are requirements to hold public office arbitrated and enforced, in the USA? The US Constitution includes a small number of requirements for federal office in the respective Articles, [I](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei) for Congress and [II](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii) for the Presidency, but no specific arbitration or enforcement mechanism. What happens if a candidate or elected officer's claim to meeting these requirements is in dispute? Do any of the States have set processes for this?

When are the results of a US election historically known? This [Vox article](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23445541/midterm-elections-2022-results-election-night-mail-in-ballot) gives some reasons why the results of an election are not available on Election Day. For example, some states can't start processing mail-in ballots until Election Day, automatic recounts, challenges to results etc. While the article does mention 2020 results like the fact Arizona's results weren't called until nine days after Election Day, it does not go into the broader history of when elections are called.  * When are the results of a US election historically known?

What is the history of a party promoting opposition candidates they deem to be unelectable? During the 2022 midterm primary, the Democratic party promoted opposition candidates they deemed to be [unelectable](https://www.vox.com/23274469/democrats-extremist-republicans-mastriano-cox-bailey). There was a lot of [back and forth](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/tamara-keith-and-amy-walter-on-the-end-of-primary-season-and-midterm-messaging) about the wisdom of such a strategy, as well as the ethics of purposely elevating these individuals on the state and national stage. [But the gamble seems to have paid off.](https://news.yahoo.com/democrats-risky-midterm-strategy-elevate-170030916.html?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9kcnVkZ2VyZXBvcnQuY29tLw&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACixHEaaJgz9xQSgO9nvhZzBVUjMEaQ5EPore-p0qYQS1gnNiqgIkqOuJm6M1T2xRcjxBOdAXRylnB5_Y5MWnNTOLUSSwnOrXDwUBFMO10t9u5pMWcyQNjTtqMF-vyxNw9rJ9VZHlhgoCSdTYe7wY1OAvbgTB7ZFEu9IU6TzEWDg&_guc_consent_skip=1668089038).  I am aware of smaller scale examples of this, such as the semi-recent [Kanye West](https://www.thedailybeast.com/kanye-wests-independent-campaign-was-secretly-run-by-gop-elites) and [Scott Taylor](https://www.pilotonline.com/news/crime/vp-nw-petition-investigation-continues-20210629-ebefjkgzr5holiklaoibxldlsq-story.html) controversies, which obviously failed to achieve their goals in any way, and at least in the latter case, involved criminal acts.  However I'm curious about what other examples are there of this tactic being used in US elections in the post-war period?

What are the pros and cons of a federal government in the USA with one-person-one-vote for national policy and elections regardless of one's zip code, as envisioned in the proposal below? [https://harvardlawreview.org/2020/01/pack-the-union-a-proposal-to-admit-new-states-for-the-purpose-of-amending-the-constitution-to-ensure-equal-representation/](https://harvardlawreview.org/2020/01/pack-the-union-a-proposal-to-admit-new-states-for-the-purpose-of-amending-the-constitution-to-ensure-equal-representation/)  The article's authors begin with the premise that members of the American electorate have vastly unequal representation in the federal government, which results in an undemocratic, and thus unfair form of governance.  >Just as it was unfair to exclude women and minorities from the franchise, so too is it unfair to weight votes differently.      Some may call theirs a radical solution. Is it that much more radical than adding Nevada as a state with a population of only 10,000-ish when it needed 60,000 \[[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada#Statehood_(1864))\]\[[2](https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/decennial/1860/population/1860a-41.pdf)\]?

Is the sub-minimum wage / tip credit system in the US ultimately beneficial or harmful for the servers themselves? There are a number of referendums to remove the sub-minimum wage/tip credit system on the ballot this year (in [Portland](https://www.mainepublic.org/business-and-economy/2022-09-13/restaurant-owners-staff-launch-campaign-against-portland-proposal-to-end-tip-credit) and [DC](https://www.axios.com/local/washington-dc/2022/10/25/initiative-82-tipping-dc), for example).  What surprises me the most is that servers are [generally on the side of keeping the sub-minimum wage](https://voteno82.com) as is.  My question is, are servers better off with the sub-minimum wage system (lower wage / higher tips), or is the concern of tips disappearing either overblown or a part of a larger misinformation campaign? I can easily see the concern by the business owners (burden of paying their employees is shifted back to them, rather than on the consumer), but I want to know what the impact to the servers would be.  Are there tangible examples and studies of when this occurred in the past? What was the outcome?
What, if any, is the effect of government cash payouts on inflation? Many countries during the COVID pandemic [encated stimulus measures](https://www.investopedia.com/government-stimulus-and-relief-efforts-to-fight-the-covid-19-crisis-5113980) to help offset the effects of COVID on their economies. California is now giving [cash payouts](https://www.ktvu.com/news/california-inflation-relief-payments-heres-when-youll-get-the-money) to people who qualify, to help offset inflation.   Some argue that these [measures actually increase inflation](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/10/12/californias-inflation-relief-payouts-are-a-bad-idea).

Others see these subsidies as providing [critical food security](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1755-1315/548/2/022077/meta) and ensuring there remains a supply chain of foodstuffs within nations.  * So my question is, what mechanisms are available to a large nation (say >10mn people) to ensure diverse food security without significant subsidies or large-scale protectionism? * Do any countries employ such mechanisms and if so, what is the result?
What procedural actions can the US President use to loosen cannabis restrictions across the country? Last week US President Joe Biden [announced](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-overhauls-us-policy-marijuana-pardons-prior-federal-offenses-2022-10-06/) major steps toward reforming US policy on marijuana (cannabis). Biden said he is issuing presidential pardons to thousands of people convicted for possession of the drug, which is illegal at the federal level and in some states, and directing his administration to review the classification of the drug. How far can the Biden administration push these changes alone, or where would the involvement of other levels or branches of government be required?  * What is the process by which a drug's federal classification is reviewed, what are the consequences of reclassification, and how much influence does the president have over this process? * How is the Executive Branch's marijuana policy constrained by federal legislation, i.e. how much could the White House change direction without requiring Congress to pass new legislation? * Are there constitutional debates about Biden's announced or potential steps forward that could require the judiciary to resolve? * Biden urged governors to take similar action at the state level; are there methods beyond the bully pulpit that the president can use to press state governments toward reforming their policies?

In recent years, the political right has been [gaining popular support in Italy,](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/06/its-the-right-wings-italy-now/562256/) supposedly "swept in on a wave of anxiety about immigration and the economy" and then [broadening its support with a more tempered message.](https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/06/29/italy-far-right-brothers-fratelli-giorgia-meloni-salvini-league/)  The most recent milestone in this trend is the [electoral victory of an alliance of politically right parties,](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/09/25/europe/italy-election-results-intl/index.html) clearing the way for Giorgia Meloni to become prime minister. She has been characterized in the English-language press as "the most far-right prime minister since Mussolini."  What policies, if any, does this coalition support that makes it "far-right"? What is behind the rightward political shift of the Italian electorate?

[META]User Feedback Solicitation - How Can We Be Better Over the past year we've perceived  both an increase in frequency of rule breaking comments as well as a shift in the type of rules being broken. Removals were once primarily driven by sourcing violations (rule 2), but now appear to have shifted to issues with users directly addressing each other (rule 4) and off-topic/low effort replies (rule 3).  As such, comment sections are becoming more barren, which can be a disappointing experience for users who have worked hard to bring their submissions into compliance.   As such, we wanted to solicit some feedback to better understand the user experience with this subreddit, including but not limited to discussions concerning :  * [Commenting rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_comment_rules) * [Submission standards](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_submission_rules) * Moderation of both submissions and comments * Overall user experience  The intent of this is to have a productive discussion to both alleviate user frustration while still maintaining evenhanded, empirical discussion of political issues.

What are the effects of states using migrant drop-offs as a means to protest border policy? Immigration from the United States' southern neighbor has been a [continued election issue](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/immigration-shaped-united-states-history) over the years with many on the right [blaming democrats for increased illegal immigration](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/republicans-seize-on-bidens-border-challenges-to-reframe-the-immigration-debate) or campaigning on [migrant caravans](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/10/23/trump-caravan-midterm-elections-875888).   Certainly, this isn't a new issue, but recent events have seemed to escalate when in August Texas governor Greg Abbott [began bussing migrants](https://abcnews.go.com/US/texas-gov-greg-abbott-doubles-busing-migrants-nyc/story?id=88541210) to [sanctuary cities](https://cis.org/Map-Sanctuary-Cities-Counties-and-States). The issue has only continued to grow as Florida politicians make [claims that the federal government is sending thousands of migrants into Florida communities at night](https://www.news4jax.com/news/local/2021/10/20/trust-index-are-thousands-of-illegal-immigrants-flying-into-jacksonville-in-the-middle-of-the-night/), and while this assertion [rates as mostly false](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/mar/16/tyler-kistner/claims-biden-secretly-flying-immigrants-us-cities-/), it has been used to justify further escalation in the immigration fight by Florida governor Ron DeSantis where he has decided to send migrants to [Martha's Vineyard](https://www.npr.org/2022/09/15/1123109768/migrants-sent-to-marthas-vineyard), and has moved migrants [outside of Kamala Harris's residence](https://www.fox5dc.com/news/2-buses-of-migrants-arrive-outside-vp-harriss-residence-in-dc-fox-news#amp_ct=1663249108155&amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&aoh=16632491018182&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fox5dc.com%2Fnews%2F2-buses-of-migrants-arrive-outside-vp-harriss-residence-in-dc-fox-news).   In these recent incidents, states targeted by Florida and Texas claim no prior warning was given in order to prepare funding and supplies, forcing them to scramble for resources. Certainly looking at [recent challenges](https://www.law.georgetown.edu/salpal/the-right-to-travel-and-national-quarantines-coronavirus-tests-the-limits/) for interstate travel, questions about controlling travel is murky, and the constitutional authority  [only addresses interstate travel in terms of US citizens' right](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/amendment-14/section-1/interstate-travel), whom these migrants may not yet be.  Are there any legal avenues that states can take to stop, prevent, or receive restitution for other states sending migrants to them? In the case where individual people, such as Harris, are targeted, does this open any new legal avenues? What kinds of relief or restrictions can the federal government provide? What kinds of restrictions can targeted states put in place themselves to prevent these actions?
What are the known policies that have the greatest effect on US worker productivity? [Worker productivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workforce_productivity) is an economic's measurement that is defined as  > the amount of goods and services that a group of workers produce in a given amount of time.  Last year, [the Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/08/18/us-productivity-boom/) noted Federal investment in digital and physical infrastructure as a source of optimism for a potential productivity boom.   However this "boom" did not come to pass as according to the US Department of Labor, productivity per worker is down [2.4% from the previous year](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/revisions-confirm-steep-decline-us-productivity-second-quarter-2022-09-01/), marking the second straight quarter decline and the steepest year-on-year decline since statistics on productivity have been captured.   While acknowledging that worker productivity is affected by [employer policies](https://www.ottawa.edu/online-and-evening/blog/december-2020/ways-to-increase-employee-productivity-in-2021) and [individual actions](https://www.nytimes.com/guides/business/how-to-improve-your-productivity-at-work), there still remains the question about the role of governmental policies.

What are the pros and cons of US Democrats promoting Republican primary candidates they view as extremists? Today is the [last day of Congressional primaries](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/3634677-campaign-report-last-primaries-of-the-year-set-for-tuesday/) in the US.   The season has been marked by incidences of Democratic party campaigns and groups using a [controversial strategy](https://www.vox.com/23274469/democrats-extremist-republicans-mastriano-cox-bailey) of promoting specific Republicans with the expectation that they'll be easier candidates to defeat in the general election.  Tamara Keith of NPR [highlighted two of the risks](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/tamara-keith-and-amy-walter-on-the-end-of-primary-season-and-midterm-messaging) of this strategy last night. First, it could backfire:  > Democrats are getting the opponents they want, largely. But be careful what you wish for. There were a lot of Hillary Clinton supporters who wanted Donald Trump as an opponent. And they got Donald Trump as president.  and second, it looks hypocritical:  > ...this is happening at a time when Democrats, most notably President Biden, are shouting from the rooftops about the risk that these candidates pose to American democracy, that the idea that people will deny election outcomes, that that is a danger to America, at the same time that some Democratic outside groups are boosting these candidates. [Note that the Vox article above demonstrates it's not just "outside groups," but the DCCC and some actual Democratic campaigns too.]  As part of this strategy, Democrats [contributed to the defeat](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/07/democrats-boosted-extremists-republican-primaries-was-that-wise) of Michigan representative Peter Meijer, one of the few Republicans who voted to impeach Donald Trump over January 6, by funding his election-denying opponent John Gibbs. Rep. Adam Kinzinger, the retiring Republican who is on the January 6 committee and has been strongly outspoken against Donald Trump, [criticized that particular tactic](https://www.axios.com/2022/08/03/kinzinger-dccc-meijer-gibbs) this way: "Don’t keep coming to me asking where are all the good Republicans are that defend democracy and then take your donor’s money and spend half a million dollars promoting one of the worst election deniers that’s out there."  On the other hand, the Democratic party faces [structural biases in the House](https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/the-houses-republican-bias-does-it-exist/) and particularly [strong headwinds](https://wtop.com/congress/2022/06/democrats-face-political-headwinds-in-midterm-elections/) this year. They're also historically [criticized](https://news.yahoo.com/democrats-must-play-hardball-survive-100016745.html) for not playing electoral "hardball" like the Republicans.  So, what are the pros and cons of this strategy of funding primary opponents believed to be easier to defeat? What have been the results of such strategies in past elections?
What is known about the current state of Brexit? In one of her final acts as Queen, the recently passed [Queen Elizabeth II](https://www.cnn.com/uk/live-news/queen-elizabeth-death-reaction-news-09-09-22/index.html)  appointed a new Prime Minister in [Liz Truss](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-09/the-city-donors-who-backed-britain-s-new-prime-minister).

Does a demise of the crown require the dissolution of the UK Parliament? There is reporting today that Queen Elizabeth II [is under medical supervision](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/uk-62834633) and that her family is coming to Balmoral Castle to be with her.  Given the circumstances, I wanted to ask about the legal effects of a demise of the crown.  From what I can find on [Wikipedia,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succession_to_the_Crown_Act_1707) the Succession to the Crown Act of 1707 provides that Parliament can sit for 6 months following a demise of the Crown.  Is that a maximum limit?  Currently the [legal limit on the length of the current Parliament is until January, 2025.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_United_Kingdom_general_election)  If the Queen were to pass shortly, that would then be sometime around March 2023.  Is the Wikipedia summary accurate that a Parliament would need to be dissolved within 6 months, forcing a snap election?  If so, would the current Parliament be able to change that in that interim period, assuming they want to avoid a general election?  **Edit**  There is a clear answer to this question: [No.](https://erskinemay.parliament.uk/section/6505/demise-of-the-crown/)  It's also mentioned on the Wikipedia page and I somehow missed that.
What legal or unenumerated rights, if any, does the monarchy currently have over the UK government? Today the British monarchy accepted [Liz Truss](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/who-is-liz-truss-britains-new-prime-minister/) as the new Prime Minister of the UK. [This article](https://www.history.com/news/what-is-the-queens-role-in-british-government) gives an overview of the British Monarch's role in the UK government over the past 300 years or so. To quote,  >"the representative government is said to govern 'in her name,' and her formal assent is still required for many of the functions of state, but for the Queen to criticize, impede, or fail to assent to the will of Parliament would be a violation of over a century of tradition."  Note the article states "tradition" rather than a requirement by law. So the question is, what legal or [unenumerated rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unenumerated_rights), if any, does the monarchy currently have over the UK government? What are the potential impacts of exercising those rights? When (if any) has the monarchy done this in the past?
What are the pros and cons of appointing a special counsel to oversee the investigation of former President Trump? The [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/29/us/politics/trump-justice-department-documents.html?smid=nytcore-ios-sharehttps://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/29/us/politics/trump-justice-department-documents.html?referringSource=articleShare) laid out the challenges the Department of Justice faces in the current investigation of the former President. Added to this complexity per the article is the potential of a Criminal referral from the House January 6th committee.   [200 CFR 600.1](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/28/600.1) states that a special council may be appointed if there exists a conflict of interest or extraordinary circumstances and that it would be in the public interest.   It appears the prerequisites exist to appoint a special counsel  but what are the pros and cons of the DOJ choosing this option.
What are the potential legal/political avenues to challenge or defend Biden's proposed college loan debt cancellation plan? President Biden recently announced a [three-part plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/08/24/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-student-loan-relief-for-borrowers-who-need-it-most/) for addressing student loans. The most high-profile and contentious parts of these and the one I'd like to focus on is the $10-20K in debt cancellation:  > Provide targeted debt relief to address the financial harms of the pandemic, fulfilling the President’s campaign commitment. The Department of Education will provide up to $20,000 in debt cancellation to Pell Grant recipients with loans held by the Department of Education, and up to $10,000 in debt cancellation to non-Pell Grant recipients. Borrowers are eligible for this relief if their individual income is less than $125,000 ($250,000 for married couples). No high-income individual or high-income household – in the top 5% of incomes – will benefit from this action. To ensure a smooth transition to repayment and prevent unnecessary defaults, the pause on federal student loan repayment will be extended one final time through December 31, 2022. Borrowers should expect to resume payment in January 2023.  Some, like [Mark Joseph Stern](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2022/08/biden-student-debt-relief-legal-supreme-court.html), believe that SCOTUS may end student debt relief while others, like [Jack V. Hoover](https://www.virginialawreview.org/articles/standing-and-student-loan-cancellation/), argue that no one has standing to challenge the plan.  The title refers to political avenues as well. Given that Democrats hold both [houses of the Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/117th_United_States_Congress), it's unlikely they would oppose the head of their party.   * If Congress changes parties, is there a precedent for the GOP to follow in challenging the bill if they win one or both chambers of Congress?   * Is there a precedent for the Democrats to pursue to defend the plan if they were to lose one or both chambers of Congress?  * Any insight into the relevant precedent and/or legal theory that could be used to challenge/defend Biden's debt cancellation plan would also be appreciated. This would include may have a plausible argument for standing.   ___  This submission was posted at the request of /u/IcedAndCorrected
What is known about the procedures and mechanisms when a "none of the above" option wins an election? The ["none of the above"](https://www.votenone.org.uk/none_of_the_above.html), is a ballot option designed to allow the voter to indicate disapproval of the candidates in a voting system. Such an option exists in places like [Nevada](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/not-fan-candidate-nevada-can-vote-none-candidates) while other states like [California](http://www.smartvoter.org/2000/03/07/ca/state/prop/23/) have attempted to add it.

How is extremism defined in political parties/candidates? This [study (PDF warning)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0963721418817755) published in the Association for Psychological Science journal, ([7.29 IF](https://academic-accelerator.com/Impact-of-Journal/Psychological-Science)) list four factors that are common among politically extreme groups:    * psychological distress  * cognitive simplicity * overconfidence * intolerance  Sometimes these are clearly obvious as in the case of the Illinois race with Arthur Jones [who is a self-admitted neo-nazi](https://www.npr.org/local/309/2020/03/06/812648554/illinois-g-o-p-makes-a-rare-primary-endorsement-to-stop-a-neo-nazi-candidate), who was actively campaigned against by his own party in the election.

What is the relevant law surrounding a President-elect, current President, or former President and their handling of classified documentation? "[The FBI executed a search warrant Monday at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida](https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/politics/mar-a-lago-search-warrant-fbi-donald-trump/index.html), as part of an investigation into the handling of presidential documents, including classified documents, that may have been brought there, three people familiar with the situation told CNN."  Now, my understanding is that ["Experts agreed that the president, as commander-in-chief, is ultimately responsible for classification and declassification."](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2017/may/16/james-risch/does-president-have-ability-declassify-anything-an/)  This would strongly suggest that, when it comes to classifying and declassifying documentation, if the President does it, it must be legal, i.e. if the President is treating classified documentation as if it were unclassified, there is no violation of law.  I understand that the [President-elect](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/nongovernment-national-security-experts-brief-biden-as-trump-resists-transition.html) and [former President](https://news.clearancejobs.com/2020/11/30/former-presidents-and-eligibility-to-access-classified-information/)s are also privy to privileged access to classified documents, although it seems any privileges are conveyed by the sitting President.

What is known about the political context and reasoning behind the decision to restrict abortion after 10-14 weeks of pregnancy for many European countries? The Dobbs decision [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392\_6j37.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf) finds that the U.S. Constitution "does not confer a right to abortion." This decision has sparked discussion of new legislation that would delineate abortion rights and restrictions. For example, the governor of Viriginia has proposed a rule that bans most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/06/24/virginia-youngkin-abortion-15-week-ruling/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/06/24/virginia-youngkin-abortion-15-week-ruling/).  Most countries in Europe also restrict abortion (in various ways) after about 12 weeks of pregnancy [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion\_in\_Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_in_Europe). What is history and reasoning behind this common time limit?

Did the national committees of the two major American political parties release post-election reviews after the last two Presidential Elections? If so, what is known about the plans and their effectiveness? This is a mod rework of a user submission ___   Following the 2012 Presidential election loss of [Mitt Romney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_United_States_presidential_election), the Republican National Committee released a post-election review titled the ["Growth and Opportunity Project"](http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/documents/politics/republican-national-committees-growth-and-opportunity-project-report/380/?itid=lk_inline_manual_1), more commonly known as the [autopsy](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/rnc-completes-autopsy-2012-loss-calls-inclusion-policy/story?id=18755809).

How does France practice neocolonialism in former African colonies? What is known about the effects of this practice? [Neocolonialism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/neocolonialism), a term that emerged after World War II, is defined as   > the control of less-developed countries by developed countries through indirect means.... Neocolonialism has been broadly understood as a further development of capitalism that enables capitalist powers (both nations and corporations) to dominate subject nations through the operations of international capitalism rather than by means of direct rule.  France had an [extensive colonial empire in Africa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_French_possessions_and_colonies#In_Africa) and ["has maintained a privileged sphere of influence, the so-called 'pre carre', in sub-Saharan Africa, based on a series of family-like ties with its former colonies.

What are the historical reasons for the lack of Federal success of third-party candidates in the United States? This is a mod rework of a user submission ___  Historically, United States [third party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_party_(United_States\)) candidates have performed poorly in [Presidential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_third_party_performances_in_United_States_presidential_elections#Major_third_party_performances_(1788%E2%80%93present), [Congressional House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_third_party_performances_in_United_States_House_elections) and [Congressional Senate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_third_party_and_independent_performances_in_United_States_elections#Senate_elections) elections : currently there are only [two third party members](https://ballotpedia.org/Current_independent_and_third-party_federal_and_state_officeholders) in each chamber.

What are some real or proposed alternative models for a national high court compared with the design of the US Supreme Court? The US Supreme Court has [made](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-gun-law-new-york-second-amendment/) [headlines](https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/24/politics/dobbs-mississippi-supreme-court-abortion-roe-wade/index.html) [repeatedly](https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-coach-prayer-2981a8073ea82a1a688c367270c941aa) over the past week with rulings overturning decades-old precedents and changing the way certain fundamental civil rights are interpreted across the country. Critics have [proposed](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/democrats-introduce-bill-expand-supreme-court-9-13-justices-n1264132) reforming the Court by adding new Justices.  Under the US Constitution, [the Supreme Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States) consists of Justices who are nominated by the President and confirmed by a majority vote of the Senate. Each Justice has lifetime tenure, meaning they leave office only by resignation, retirement, death, or removal by impeachment. The number of Justices is not specified in the Constitution but since [1869](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary_Act_of_1869) Congress has chosen to keep it at nine. A special power of the courts in the US, over which the Supreme Court has the final word, is [judicial review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_review_in_the_United_States): the court may strike down legislation, executive actions, and treaties (acts of the other branches of government) if it finds them in violation the Constitution or other law and precedent.   Aside from the number of Justices, how do these constitutional features of the US Supreme Court compare with the high courts of other countries, or of states within the US? And have specific revisions been proposed for the design of the US Supreme Court itself?

The US Supreme Court has found there is no inherent right to privacy in the Constitution, thereby overturning the Roe v. Wade decision that guaranteed a right to abortion. How does this decision impact other privacy-related rights? The Supreme Court in its decision on Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization said that has conferred that there is no right to privacy, ["Indeed, the 78-page opinion, which has a 30-page appendix, seemingly leaves no authority uncited as support for the proposition that there is no inherent right to privacy or personal autonomy in various provisions of the constitution."](https://www.npr.org/2022/06/24/1102305878/supreme-court-abortion-roe-v-wade-decision-overturn).   Which rights in the US are predicated on a right to privacy? How does today's ruling affect those rights? Can the government now make legislation about monitoring speed limits with devices in cars by Federal Law for example?

What legal and procedural mechanisms within our Governments framework - whether it be at the federal, state, or local level - exist that would stop a losing candidate in a Presidential election from seeking to overturn the result ? (Reposting via Moderator's edit and adding sources)  In the wake of the 2020 election, former President Donald Trump reacted to his electoral loss by declaring that the result of the election were illegitimate and rigged, based on an unproven theory that there was widespread election fraud ([source](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/06/13/trumps-election-fraud-claims-were-false-here-are-his-advisers-who-said-so-00039346)).

What are the pros and cons of codifying rights through legislation rather than constitutional interpretation and vice versa? [Roe v. Wade](https://supreme.findlaw.com/supreme-court-insights/roe-v--wade-case-summary--what-you-need-to-know.html) was a 1973 decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in which the Court ruled that the Constitution of the United States protects a pregnant woman's liberty to choose to have an abortion without excessive government restriction. Recently, a leaked draft opinion shows that the Supreme Court may overturn the 1973 ruling [(source)](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473)  In a opinion piece, constitutional law professor [Akhil Reed Amar](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-end-of-roe-v-wade-11652453609?mod=article_inline) argues that   > ruling in the case was simply not grounded either in what the Constitution says or in the long-standing, widely embraced mores and practices of the country.

Who benefits from the existence of the USA's Controlled Substances Act and Drug Enforcement Agency? [The Controlled Substances Act](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-84/pdf/STATUTE-84-Pg1236.pdf) (pdf) created drug "schedules" determining how a drug could be used or research, based on medical and abuse potential. Schedule I precludes both medical use and research, except with permission from the DEA, based on the following criteria:  * The drug or other substance has a high potential for abuse.  * The drug or other substance has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.  * There is a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug or other substance under medical supervision.  The [Drug Enforcement Administration](https://web.archive.org/web/20161020143354/http://resources.learningforlife.org/exploring/scholarships/pdf/dea.pdf) (pdf) is the primary federal law enforcement agency charged with the responsibility of enforcing narcotics and controlled substance laws and regulations. The DEA was established July 1, 1973, by Presidential Reorganization Plan No. 2. It resulted from the merger of the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, the Office of Drug Abuse Law Enforcement, the Office of National Narcotics Intelligence, and elements of the Bureau of Customs and the Office of Science and Technology.  The USA did not always have Federal drug laws and specialized drug law enforcement; who benefits from this statutory and enforcement scheme?
What actions have been adopted by countries to reduce domestic terrorism? What data exists demonstrating the effects of these actions? Earlier this year, a paper by the Center for Strategic and International Studies appears to [demostrate](https://www.csis.org/analysis/evolution-domestic-terrorism) the growing threat of domestic terrorism in the United States. Currently, 18 U.S. Code § 2331 ["domestic terrorism"](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2331) as :  >(A) involve acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any State;  >(B) appear to be intended—  >(i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population;  >(ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or  >(iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and   Some notable recent events have been characterized as such. For example, following the [January 6th U.S. Capital Insurrection](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2021/jan-6-insurrection-capitol/), FBI Director Christopher Wray characterized the insurrection as domestic terrorism and [warned of a growing threat of home grown violence extremism](https://apnews.com/article/fbi-chris-wray-testify-capitol-riot-9a5539af34b15338bb5c4923907eeb67).

Is there a precedent for holding public officials accountable for public health failings? A recent [editorial](https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n314) by Dr. Kamran Abbasi, the [executive editor](https://www.bmj.com/about-bmj/editorial-staff/kamran-abbasi) of [the BMJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_BMJ), argues that politicians who  > wilfully neglect scientific advice, international and historical experience, and their own alarming statistics and modelling because to act goes against their political strategy or ideology  may be guilty of ["social murder"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_murder). The concept of social murder was created by German philosopher Friedrich Engels and can be [characterized](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/27/the-failings-behind-the-uks-abysmal-death-toll) as  > forcing sections of the population to live in conditions which have inevitably led to avoidable, premature deaths, and will continue to do so.

Is there a neutral watchdog/organization/website that monitors state legislation and proposed bills that are likely to be unconstitutional? This is a resource request.  In recent years, there seems to be a trend for state legislatures to file and/or pass legislation that may be unconstitutional at the time it is passed. For instance, the [2021 SB 8 / HB 1515 Texas Heartbeat Act bans abortions after six weeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Heartbeat_Act), which appears to be in direct conflict with multiple SCOTUS rulings such as Roe v. Wade that have previously established that women have a right to abortion up until viability.  Another example is [HB 813 Abolition of Abortion in Louisiana Act](https://legiscan.com/LA/bill/HB813/2022) (2022), which is set up to [ban certain contraceptives](https://www.arklatexhomepage.com/news/local-news/will-hb-813-end-emergency-contraceptive-access-in-louisiana/) if it passes, which is in direct conflict with [Griswold v. Connecticut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griswold_v._Connecticut) that established that Americans have a right to contraceptives.  A third example is [HB 675](https://legislature.idaho.gov/sessioninfo/2022/legislation/h0675/) in Idaho (2022) which [criminalizes parents of transgender youth for seeking out-of-state gender affirming medical care](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/idaho-trans-health-care-youth-bill-rcna19287), which from my (limited) understanding of Constitution may violate the [Interstate Commerce clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce_Clause).  This is a non-exhaustive list, and I find it very difficult to track all these instances of legislative bills that have are probably unconstitutional (as of May 2022). In the year of 2022, [546 abortion restrictions](https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2022/03/2022-state-legislative-sessions-abortion-bans-and-restrictions-medication-abortion) were introduced by state legislations and 37 were enacted. Dozens of local and district courts have moved to [temporarily block such legislation](https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/state-policies-later-abortions) on the basis that they are currently unconstitutional.  I was wondering if anyone knew of any neutral and nonpartisan resources that compiled and monitored legislation that has a high likelihood of being unconstitutional.

What are the pros and cons of banning dual citizens from running for federal public office in the United States? [Some countries](https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/politics/federal/wa-senator-resigns-after-realising-he-s-a-dual-citizen-20220415-p5adrb.html) bar dual citizens from holding public office. Currently, the United States is not one of them.   There is, however, a brewing controversy surrounding Dr. Mehmet Oz, candidate for the United States Senate for the state of Pennsylvania. While he was [born in the United States](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Mehmet-Oz), he holds [Turkish citizenship acquired through his parents](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/senate-dr-oz-turkish-citizenship-b2037497.html), who are Turkish immigrants.  The controversy arose when Senator Dan Sullivan (R-AK) said that intelligence reports may not be shared to Dr. Oz when he is elected to the Senate, citing his Turkish citizenship and adding that Turkey "[isn't part of a group of nations that the U.S. shares more closely held intelligence with](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dr-mehmet-oz-will-renounce-turkish-citizenship-if-elected-to-senate/)". This was amplified by David McCormick, another Republican candidate for the Senate seat, who said:  >""To me, it's just inconceivable that you would make a decision that somehow would limit your access to this kind of intelligence that you need to do the job," Sullivan told reporters. "My view is you need full access to all the intel that the different intelligence agencies provide us senators."  Normally speaking, [Members of Congress are presupposed to be trustworthy enough to be granted intelligence information so that they can more properly oversee national security-related processes](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/informing-congress-intelligence-activities), presumably, this also applies to other federal positions. However, is this no longer operative, especially if the country that conferred the citizenship to the candidate is not a close or traditional ally of the United States? Are there arguments for or against the limiting of public office to people who are not dual citizens? Does this negatively affect the quality of the pool of candidates from which voters can choose from? Is this a reasonable restriction or not?
What is the constitutional basis for protection of same-sex marriage and sexual relations in the US? [The leak of a draft majority opinion](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473) from the US Supreme Court this week gave more support to [widespread expectations](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/04/25/if-roe-v-wade-is-overturned-whats-next) that the Court will reverse its 1973 *Roe v. Wade* and 1992 *Planned Parenthood v. Casey* decisions, resulting in swift or immediate abortion bans in many parts of the country. However, in a less clear sign for the future, Justice Samuel Alito also [finds weakness](https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000180-874f-dd36-a38c-c74f98520000#page=32) in a list of other civil-rights decisions including [*Lawrence v. Texas* (2003)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_v._Texas), which prevents governments from banning same-sex sexual intercourse ("sodomy"), and [*Obergefell v. Hodges* (2015)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obergefell_v._Hodges), which requires governments to give equal recognition to same-sex and opposite-sex marriages:  > These attempts to justify abortion through appeals to a broader right to autonomy and to define one's "concept of existence" prove too much. *Casey*, 505 U.S., at 851. **Those criteria, at a high level of generality, could license fundamental rights to illicit drug use, prostitution, and the like.** See *Compassion in Dying v. Washington*, 85 F. 3d 1440, 1444 (CA9 1996) (O'Scannlain, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing *en banc*). **None of these rights has any claim to being deeply rooted in history.** *Id.*, at 1440, 1445.  (emphasis added)  So if their lack of deep historical roots is a flaw and the "broader right to autonomy" is not a solid foundation, what is the remaining constitutional justification for the *Lawrence* and *Obergefell* decisions? How is a right to same-sex relations better supported than a right to illicit drug use or prostitution? Assuming the Supreme Court majority ultimately adopts something similar to the reasoning in this draft, how much of its reasoning in *Lawrence* and *Obergefell* is potentially subject to similar reconsideration?
What are the arguments, for and against, the idea that a federal law on protecting or restricting abortion access would violate the 10th Amendment?  Supreme Court Chief Roberts has [confirmed](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/03/supreme-court-says-leaked-abortion-draft-is-authentic-roberts-orders-investigation-into-leak.html) that the recent leak regarding the draft for the repeal of Roe v. Wade is real. [In response](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-draft-opinion-abortion-reactions-00029518), and even prior to this, Democrats have argued that Congress should pass laws affirming the right to access abortions across the nation. Such proposals have [already passed](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-61311966) through the House of Representatives but failed in the Senate.  Some, like former Texas Governor Perry have argued that a [Constitutional amendment](https://blog.chron.com/texaspolitics/2011/07/despite-states-rights-stand-perry-supports-federal-amendment-ban-abortion/) is required for any federal action on abortion, specifically referencing the need to amend the [10th Amendment](https://www.annenbergclassroom.org/10th-amendment/).  What are the arguments, for and against, the idea that a Federal law on protecting or restricting abortion access would violate the 10th Amendment? Are there other Constitutional hurdles to consider, e.g. [Commerce Clause](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/commerce_clause)?
What is known about current State-level proposals to limit or expand abortion rights? On May 2, 2022, [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473) released a [leaked draft](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/read-justice-alito-initial-abortion-opinion-overturn-roe-v-wade-pdf-00029504) opinion by the [Supreme Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States) written by Justice Alito. This leaked opinion overturns [Roe v. Wade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade), the landmark  court decision that protects a women's right to abortion and instead returns the decision on how to regulate [abortions](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/roe-reversal-alito-writes-manual-conservatives-reshape-court-rcna27039) back to the States.   Currently, states like [Oklahoma](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/28/us/oklahoma-abortion-legislature.html) and [Texas](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/04/18/texas-abortion-law/) have laws restricting abortions to before 6 weeks while [Maryland](https://www.npr.org/2022/04/11/1091967163/abortion-rights-health-insurance-larry-hogan-maryland-veto-fetus) expanded who is allowed to perform abortion. [13 other states](https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/03/us/state-abortion-trigger-laws-roe-v-wade-overturned/index.html) have "trigger laws" designed to take effect if Roe v. Wade is overturned.   That led me to wonder what **State-level proposals** exist that could expand or restrict abortion access if Roe V. Wade is overturned?
Under the rationale employed in the Supreme Court draft striking down Roe v. Wade, what other implicit rights are also vulnerable to being overturned? On May 2, 2022 [Politico reported that the Supreme Court has voted to overturn Roe v. Wade](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473) and a leaked version of the draft majority opinion has been disseminated. [Roe v. Wade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade) was a 1973 Supreme Court decision that ruled that the Constitution protects the right of a woman to have an abortion. In December 2021, the [Supreme Court heard arguments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women%27s_Health_Organization) on the constitutionality of a 2018 Mississippi state law banning abortion (*Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization*), and the case is currently pending.  In the leaked ruling published by Politico, Justice Samuel Alito writes:  >The Constitution makes no reference to abortion, and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision.   >   >\[...\]   >   >The inescapable conclusion is that a right to abortion is not deeply rooted in the Nation's history and traditions.   >   >On the contrary, an unbroken tradition of prohibiting abortion on pain of criminal punishment persisted from the earliest days of common law until 1973.   >   >\[...\]   >   >We can only do our job, which is to interpret the law, apply longstanding principles of stare decisis, and decide this case accordingly. We therefore hold that the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion.   >   >Roe and Casey must be overruled, and the authority to regulate abortion must be returned to the people and their elected representatives.  Under the reasoning employed in this leaked ruling, what other implicit rights similar to a "Right to Abortion" are vulnerable to being overturned?

In the past few days, [Joe Biden](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-24/biden-says-to-expect-real-food-shortages-due-to-ukraine-war) and [Justin Trudeau](https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/trudeau-warns-of-difficult-time-food-shortages-due-to-covid-19-122033000102_1.html) have warned the public within their respective countries that there is a very likely chance that food shortages could occur soon due to aftermath of the covid-19 pandemic, supply chain issues, inflation, rising gas prices, and war in Ukraine. Both in historical and modern times, rising food prices have been very disruptive. I'm making this post to begin a conversation around this topic, and ask the following question:  1. What evidence is there that there is a real risk of North Americans experiencing a food shortage due to ongoing crises? 2. Historically, what impacts has food shortages had on society? 3. What can the governments of these nations do to stop / weather such a crisis?
Why is tuition in Florida so low? Tuition at Florida colleges and universities is lower than in any other state of comparable size and economy. Annual tuition ranges from $5646 (Florida Polytechnic) at the lowest to $6590 (University of North Florida) at the highest^(1). Tuition at the University of Florida is $6380^(1).  This actually compares really favorably with college costs in the 70s and 80s! From the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), the average in-state tuition cost at a public university in 1976 was $1210^(2), which the BLS inflation calculator puts at $6174 in today's dollars^(3).  What's also interesting is that Florida higher education funding, measured by state support per full-time equivalent student, is completely unexceptional. According to the NCES, it is *literally* the average^(4).  What is Florida doing to keep tuition low? Is the Florida higher education system failing on any key metrics (research output or educational outcomes) due to low tuition revenue? If other states wanted to bring tuition costs down, would Florida's approach work elsewhere?  1: [https://www.flbog.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Cost-of-Attendance-2021-22.pdf](https://www.flbog.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Cost-of-Attendance-2021-22.pdf)  2: [https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d07/tables/dt07\_320.asp](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d07/tables/dt07_320.asp)  3: [https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation\_calculator.htm](https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm)  4: [https://ncses.nsf.gov/indicators/states/indicator/state-support-for-higher-education-per-fte-student](https://ncses.nsf.gov/indicators/states/indicator/state-support-for-higher-education-per-fte-student)  &#x200B;  Edit: I do want to clarify, based on some of the responses I'm getting, that I'm specifically interested in *how* tuition is so low in Florida *compared to other states.* That is, I want to know what is unique about Florida's situation, whether in terms of concrete policy or demographics, that allows them to keep tuition so low. I could have phrased my question a little bit better, since a few people have responded with answers about *why* Florida might want to keep its tuition low.  I've often heard people describe individual states' ability to operate as "testing grounds" for national policy as a core benefit of the America federal system, and I'm essentially interested in whether that model applies here. Could other states just copy Florida's higher education policy to keep tuition costs down?  Edit 2: I've lied to you all! Check out /u/lokujj comment below. The presentation for the table in source two is a bit confusing, and I didn't read it correctly. The actual averages for in-state tuition before and after inflation in 1976 were $689 and $3515, respectively. Obviously, Florida's costs today still compare really favorably to other states, but they can't compete with the past.

What effects have been seen from single use plastic bans? Single use plastic bans (such as on plastic drinking straws and plastic grocery bags) [have now been established in many jurisdictions for some time](https://www.ncsl.org/research/environment-and-natural-resources/plastic-bag-legislation.aspx) and have been the subject of [significant controversy.](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/12/27/21030090/straw-ban-environmental-regulation-plastic-ocean)  Given that these are no longer new and untested policies, I am trying to find information on how effective or not they have been in their goals surrounding litter and environmental harm.

What evidence is there, or lack thereof, that the energy policies of Joe Biden's administration caused the current increase in gas prices? When Biden took office, the national average price of a gallon of gasoline for the week of Jan. 18, 2021, was **$2.38.**  The week of 3/7/2022, [national prices hit 4.25$](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2022/03/09/gas-prices-diesel-record-high/9433436002/), a 79% increase.   The GOP believes that cancelling the Keystone XL pipeline and tightening regulations on the oil and gas industry contributed to the problem. "Republicans and other Biden critics say his actions and proposals since taking office –[such as canceling the Keystone pipeline, suspension of new federal oil and gas leases, higher drilling fees on federal land](https://nypost.com/2022/03/09/why-biden-energy-policies-have-contributed-to-surging-oil-prices/) and a Democratic-led push for the Federal Reserve to implement climate change policies – have sent a clear signal to US producers."

In their [most recent explanation](https://usun.usmission.gov/explanation-of-vote-at-the-third-committee-adoption-of-the-combating-glorification-of-nazism/), Nicholas Hill, the Deputy US Representative for [ECOSOC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Economic_and_Social_Council), states    > Today, however, the United States must once again express opposition to this resolution, a document most notable for its thinly veiled attempts to legitimize Russian disinformation campaigns denigrating neighboring nations and promoting the distorted Soviet narrative of much of contemporary European history, using the cynical guise of halting Nazi glorification.  > The United States Supreme Court has consistently affirmed the constitutional right to freedom of speech and the rights of peaceful assembly and association, including by avowed Nazis, whose hatred and xenophobia are vile and widely scorned by the American people. We nevertheless firmly defend the constitutional rights of those who exercise their fundamental freedoms to combat intolerance and express strong opposition to the odious Nazi creed and others that espouse similar hatreds.

What was the stated reason for NATO expansion following the dissolution of the Soviet Union?  In 1990 during the reunification of Germany, Secretary of State James Baker and leader of the communist party Mikhail Gorbachev reached an agreement, known as the Gorbachev-Baker Pact, which stated following the reunification of Germany, NATO would not expand its borders. Since that treaty was signed NATO has expanded into the Eastern Bloc. It's also important to note that Gorbachev disputes these claims, later stating     The topic of ‘NATO expansion was not discussed at all, and it wasn’t brought up in those years.

What are "full blocking" sanctions and how do they harm the Russian economy? Recently,  the U.S. announced a series of sanctions against the Russian Federation  as a result of the latter's invasion of Ukraine.

Does military action against EU members outside of NATO trigger a NATO response?    Sweden  and Finland are not signatory to NATO, but are members of the EU. The  majority of the signatories of the EU are members of NATO. The EU has clauses for mutual  aid and assistance (1) in the case of territorial aggression. Russia has  made vague threats against Finland and  Sweden should they join NATO,  including "serious military-political repercussions" (2).

What are the major events in the Ukraine–Russia border conflict since the end of the Soviet Union? The world is watching the [tense situation in Ukraine](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-56720589) as 150,000 Russian soldiers are positioned near its borders in Russia and Belarus, with the Russian government claiming it has no plans to attack while members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), with which Ukraine is informally aligned, claim Russian president Vladimir Putin is taking a belligerent posture and may have already decided to attack. This comes eight years after previous tensions in 2014 when the Russian government supported Russian-aligned separatists in eastern Ukraine and, in NATO's view, annexed these regions, which remain out of the Kyiv government's control to this day.  Looking farther back, Ukraine was one of the newly independent states that left the Soviet Union when it dissolved in 1991. How were its borders set and what was its relationship with the new Russian Federation at the time? Since then, what were the significant diplomatic or military engagements between Ukraine and Russia?

What are the practicalities of interstate extradition in the USA? The Extradition Clause of the U.S. Constitution ([Article IV Section 2](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/article-4/section-2/clause-2/)) requires that:  > A Person charged in any State with Treason, Felony, or other Crime, who shall flee from Justice, and be found in another State, shall on Demand of the executive Authority of the State from which he fled, be delivered up, to be removed to the State having Jurisdiction of the Crime.  &nbsp;  What are the practicalities of interstate extradition in the USA? As this may vary from state to state, let's use a concrete example for discussion: say a county grand jury in Georgia [indicts](https://www.justice.gov/usao/justice-101/charging) a resident of Florida for a felony.  1. Who is the "executive Authority of the State from which he fled" (Georgia, in this hypothetical)? The governor? The County DA? Someone else? 2. Who in Florida is notified, and how? Do they fax the local police? Do they send a telegram to the governor?  3. Under typical circumstances, who is responsible for taking the alleged felon into custody? Local police? State police? The FBI? 4. How is the alleged felon delivered to Georgia? Do they fly with a US Marshall? Do the local police drop them off at the border? 5. If the governor is resistant to surrendering a Florida citizen to another state to face justice,   * a) Are there any legal precedents for ignoring the Extradition Clause of the U.S. Constitution? * b) How would a situation like that proceed through the courts? Does it go directly to the US Supreme Court? * c) Might Georgia enlist some federal organization, e.g., the FBI, to deliver the alleged felon to Georgia if state officials in Georgia are uncooperative? Would that require the involvement of the US Department of Justice?
What is known about the current influx of migrants at the US Southern Border? How does the current deployment of the national guard compare to previous deployments? The current governor of Texas is facing backlash over issues arising from the mobilization of 10,000 national guard troops to the US Mexico border in Texas.   The Wall Street Journal is [reporting](https://www.wsj.com/articles/texas-gop-governor-faces-backlash-over-problems-with-national-guard-deployment-at-border-11643461204?st=alklpx59zfogbga&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink) that the deployment was hasty and troops and leaders are saying that it was unplanned and there is a lack of a clear mission.   *"“The biggest takeaway is that there’s a lack of mission,” Mr. O’Rourke said."...."A large part of the problem with the troops stems from boredom, say Texas National Guard members deployed at the border. Many members of the National Guard, who don’t have authority to enforce immigration laws, say they do very little during the day, and frustration has risen amid difficult living conditions, financial stress and months away from their families. Some have been on the mission longer than overseas deployments, without the same support resources, they said."*   The troops have redirected some 100,000 migrants to other agencies. The main reasoning for their presence is that there is a "surge" at the border:  *"Mr. Abbott has said the mission is necessary. “The mission for the National Guard and Texas DPS has been clear: deter and prevent immigrants from entering Texas illegally, including building barriers to achieve those goals, and to detain and arrest those who are violating Texas law,” Mr. Abbott’s office said in a statement this week."*  There have been prior National Guard Deployments under both the [Obama administration](https://www.texastribune.org/2010/05/25/obama-sends-1200-national-guard-troops-to-border/) where 1,200 troops were sent along all states that border Mexico, and the [Trump Administation](https://www.texastribune.org/2018/04/06/texas-national-guards-sets-us-mexico-border/) where 4,000 troops were sent along the Texas border.   Is there any proof of this influx of migrants? How has the trend looked historically, and leading up to this? Is there proof that the current large deployment is needed?
Resource Request : What resources exist describing the scope and outcomes of these Soviet economic experiments that occurred after World War II but before 1985? In his 2021 book "Collapse: the Fall of The Soviet Union" Yale historian Vladislav Zubok describes, among other things, the failed Soviet efforts at economic reforms. In the "Misguided Reforms" sections which begins [at the end of page 27](https://books.google.com/books?id=Bq9FEAAAQBAJ), Zubok states (emphasis my own):  >In early 1987, Gorbachev urged Rhyzkhov and his economists to produce a radical comprehensive reform of the Soviet economy. The key reform was Law on Socialist Enterprises. This document was the consummate product of the reformist cohort of Soviet economists, who sought to combine "socialism" with a state-regulated market...Gorbachev admitted that the passivity of people bothered him. Nobody could explain to him why, in those segments of the Soviet economy where **self-financing and self-governance had been experimentally** tried, production declined rather than increased.

What US State regulations exist that could prevent a Presidential candidate from appearing on a ballot? While the [US Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artII_S1_C5_1/) clearly lays out the qualifications for who can run for US President in Article II, Section 1, Clause 5,  [Article I, Section 4, Clause 1](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artI_S4_C1_1_1_1_1/)  leaves the administration, aka "the  times, places and manner",  of elections in the hands of  the States.

What are the advantages and disadvantages of a supermajority requirement in a legislative assembly? This week the US Senate and President [debated](https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/13/politics/kyrsten-sinema-filibuster-voting-rights/index.html) a potential reform to the Senate's rules of order: elimination of the "filibuster". Unlike a conventional [filibuster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filibuster), in which a member speaks continuously and blocks all action by the assembly, since the 1970s Senate rules have allowed a ["silent filibuster"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filibuster_in_the_United_States_Senate#The_two-track_system,_60-vote_rule_and_rise_of_the_routine_filibuster_(1970_onward\)) by which members can indefinitely block a specific action without holding the floor while the rest of the Senate's business continues unimpeded. Under current rules a vote of 60 out of the 100 Senators is required to end "debate" and proceed to the final vote, so this unusual "cloture" requirement behaves similarly to a standard [supermajority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority) requirement  in other systems. However, certain categories of motions, such as budget reconciliation, executive and judicial nominee confirmations, and emergency powers, are [effectively exempted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filibuster_in_the_United_States_Senate#Exceptions) from this process in the US Senate and require only a simple majority of 51 votes to pass.  What are the effects of supermajority requirements where they are used in other parliamentary bodies? Do they also have categories of items that require a simple majority instead? Are there notable motions in the history of the US Senate that narrowly failed because of the supermajority requirement, or that narrowly passed with a simple majority and would have failed if the current system had been in use at the time?
What legislative mechanisms exist, aside from the potentially ousted filibuster, to restrict majority party rule in the United States Senate?

The DoJ today indicted a number of Oath Keepers members for seditious conspiracy. What is the history of this law and its use? Today the DoJ [unsealed an indictment](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1462481/download) alleging among other crimes that  11 members of the Oath Keepers militia group engaged in a conspiracy "to oppose the lawful transfer of presidential power by force, by preventing, hindering, or delaying by force the execution of the laws governing the transfer of power, including the Twelfth and Twentieth Amendments to the Constitution, and Title 3, Section 15 of the United States Code."  The [seditious conspiracy statute](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2384) reads:  >If two or more persons in any State or Territory, or in any place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, conspire to overthrow, put down, or to destroy by force the Government of the United States, or to levy war against them, or to oppose by force the authority thereof, or by force to prevent, hinder, or delay the execution of any law of the United States, or by force to seize, take, or possess any property of the United States contrary to the authority thereof, they shall each be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both.  My questions are:  * Are there prior examples of prosecutions for seditious conspiracy?  If so, how do they compare to the indictment brought today by DoJ?  * How does the seditious conspiracy charge relate to the nearby codified crimes of  [rebellion or insurrection](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2383) and [treason?](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2381)  Do the facts alleged in the indictment also include the elements necessary for either of those crimes?

The Senate and House of Representatives shall meet in the Hall of the House of Representatives at the hour of 1 o’clock in the afternoon on that day, and the President of the Senate shall be their presiding officer. Two tellers shall... make a list of the votes... which announcement shall be deemed a sufficient declaration of the persons, if any, elected President and Vice President of the United States".  What happens if - e.g., due to natural disaster or civil unrest - the electoral votes are not counted on the sixth of January?

"Constitutional sheriffs" contend they have the power to determine what the law is and believe that they have the right to determine which laws to enforce and which ones to disregard. What, if any, are the plausible legal basis for this assertion? In an op-ed piece for the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/12/17/constitutional-sheriffs-extremist-dangerous-unconstitutional/), Georgetown Law Professor [Christy E. Lopez](https://www.law.georgetown.edu/faculty/christy-e-lopez/) characterizes the belief of "constitutional sheriffs" as having  >the power not only to enforce the law but to be the ultimate arbiters of what the law is in their counties.

What are the successes and failures of the Biden administration in handling the COVID-19 pandemic? Today the op-ed section of the Washington Post features [a piece](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/12/22/president-biden-is-failing-covid-19/) by [Gregg Gonsalves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregg_Gonsalves), a Yale epidemiologist who before the COVID-19 pandemic was known as a leading AIDS activist, criticizing the White House's handling of the current crisis: "President Biden is failing on COVID-19." Gonsalves accuses the president of unwillingness to change course and "reset" his policy, with a stronger push for mass vaccination as well as complementary measures including mass distribution of rapid tests and high-quality masks, in light of the rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant.  Omicron was first detected [only a month ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-2_Omicron_variant) but Biden has been in office for [eleven months](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inauguration_of_Joe_Biden).

What are the arguments, for and against, the assertion that the press should be partisans for democracy? In a recent [opinion piece ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/12/03/biden-media-coverage-worse-trump-favorable/) for the Washington Post, Dana Milbank argues the press should be  partisans for democracy, stating  >We need a skeptical, independent press. But how about being partisans for democracy? The country is in an existential struggle between self-governance and an authoritarian alternative. And we in the news media, collectively, have given equal, if not slightly more favorable, treatment to the authoritarians.

How do US States ensure that students in rural areas have access to public education? While the [Constitution](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript) does not directly address education,  [many](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/11/lawsuit-constitutional-right-education/576901/) interpret the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to apply to [educational issues](https://www.concordlawschool.edu/blog/constitutional-law/14th-amendment-protects-rights-education/).  The Supreme Court is [currently](https://www.npr.org/2021/12/08/1061996765/supreme-court-weighs-mandating-public-funds-for-religious-schools-in-maine) weighing in on a case in which the state of Maine pays the tuition of students attending nonsectarian private schools in rural areas where a vast majority lack public schools. This program is unique to Vermont and Maine but other states like [West Virginia and Mississippi](https://stacker.com/stories/2779/states-biggest-rural-populations?page=5) also have  large rural populations. Even states like California have a portion of the population that is classified as rural. This led me to wonder  - How do US States ensure that students in rural areas have access to public education? - Have any of these other methods been challenged in court? If so, what was the outcome - What is the federal role, if any, in this matter? If there is a federal role, what standards do they set? - What kinds of enforcement powers can be levied to ensure educational goals are duly provided?
Are there any countries that prohibit politicians from trading stocks and/or funds? What policies exist, both in and outside of the United States, that limit politicians' abilities to trade stocks and funds?

What are arguments and counter-arguments for Universal Child Care in the United States? Child care in the United States is expensive. The [average cost of annual childcare in America is nearly $11,000 per year, which constitutes over 20% of the income in a third of American families](https://www.neighborschools.com/blog/what-is-universal-child-care/).

This led me to wonder whether there's little popular consensus to be found across party lines supporting anything whatsoever, or do any issues, goals, or policy ideas exist that are supported by significant majorities of the electorate in aggregate, regardless of partisan ideology or affiliation, yet which remain neglected -- i.e., largely unaddressed in public policy despite broad and popular bipartisan voter support?  What data exists to identify any such popular consensus yet neglected issues?  Is there any evidence for seemingly "conservative" ideas also supported by majorities of Democrats, or seemingly "progressive" ideas also supported by majorities of Republicans, or neglected ideas that neither major party takes any position on despite majorities of support and agreement among voters across party lines?

There is currently a [climate summit happening in Glasgow](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/04/cop26-live-updates-from-climate-summit-in-glasgow.html) with plenty of world powers planning policy to reduce carbon emissions.   Because of this, my question is threefold:  1. What national policies have been adopted in an effort to reduce a nation's (or the globe's) carbon footprint? 2. What evidence exists on the effectiveness of these policies? 3. What, if any, were the consequences associated with failing to meet these policy goals?

What are the arguments for and against the idea that elections are oligarchic? For many, "fair and free elections" are synonymous with the word democracy. As the [UN Declaration of Human Rights](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights) states,  >The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government; this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or by equivalent free voting procedures.  John Stuart Mill argues  > The only government which can fully satisfy all the exigencies of the social state is one in which the whole people participate; that any participation, even in the smallest public function, is useful, that the participation should everywhere be as great as the general degree of improvement of the community will allow; and that nothing less can be ultimately desirable than the admission of all to a share in the sovereign power of the state. But since all cannot, in a community exceeding a single small town, participate personally in any but some very minor portions of the public business, it follows that the ideal type of a perfect government must be representative. [2, pp 95, 3]  However, some philosophers have claimed that elections are a tool of "oligarchy". For example in *The Social Contract*. Rousseau [writes] (https://www.bartleby.com/168/315.html),  > The moment a people allows itself to be represented, it is no longer free: it no longer exists.” (Social Contract, III, 15). [1]  Aristotle also [stated](http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/politics.4.four.html),  >The appointment of magistrates by lot is thought to be democratic, and the election of them oligarchic.   Finally [Robert Michels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_law_of_oligarchy) suggests that as no sufficiently large and complex organization can function purely as a direct democracy, power eventually is delegated. For Michels, such organization inevitably leads to oligarchy.    So are elections tools of "natural aristocracy" or "oligarchy", or are they the best practical system for scaling democracy to a state?     # References  1.

What is publicly known about the history of these negotiations? What are the positions and proposals of the major factions? What partial agreements have already been reached and what items are still in contention? How do the debt-ceiling and shutdown disputes fit into the recent context of previous times when these deadlines loomed, and how does the scope of the funding bills compare with regular Congressional budgeting?

What precedent exists for governments to seize private property to use for public housing? Recently a proposal passed that would result in the Berlin city government taking over about 240,000 apartments from private corporate owners \[1\].   For the sake of conversation, let's define public housing as housing either owned or subsidized by a government. \[2\]  I had a couple of questions regarding that policy proposal:  1. Is there a precedent for this activity in Germany or elsewhere in the world? What was the context behind the action? 2.

Was John Eastman's six-step plan to overturn the 2020 presidential election constitutional? On January 4, 2021, then-President Donald Trump asked his Vice President Mike Pence to consider a memo written by John Eastman, a noted law professor and member of Trump's legal team. [**That memo**](https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/21/politics/read-eastman-memo/index.html), which [was obtained last week by CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/20/politics/trump-pence-election-memo/index.html), sets out a six-step plan for the Vice President, presiding over the Jan. 6 counting of electoral votes, to override the [Electoral Count Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_Count_Act) ("which is likely unconstitutional") and ignore the electoral counts from seven states whose election results were disputed. Trump held a majority of electoral votes among the remaining states so the VP would then declare him the winner.  Eastman wrote "The main thing here is that Pence should do this without asking for permission - either from a vote of the joint session or from the Court" and emphasized that "the Constitution assigns this power to the Vice President as the ultimate arbiter". However, Pence consulted other advisors who told him he could not intervene in that way and in the end he declared Biden the winner after counting all the electoral votes.  Eastman provided CNN [**a longer version of the memo**](http://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2021/images/09/21/privileged.and.confidential.--.jan.3.memo.on.jan.6.scenario.pdf) outlining the election controversies in the seven disputed states and several other scenarios in which the Vice President could raise those disputes in the Jan. 6 joint session.  ---  What are the constitutional strengths and weaknesses of Eastman's analysis? If a Vice President does override the Electoral Count Act and certifies a different winner of the presidential election, then as Eastman suggests "let[s] the other side challenge his actions in court", what is the procedure for that legal challenge and what is the power of the court to change the election result, before or after the inauguration only two weeks later?

What are the legal standards used to determine if a State law does or does not infringe on an individual's privacy? Certain conduct is protected by the Constitution, and rights to privacy are implicitly defended by some of its amendments, such as the [2nd's promised right to bear arms]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Bill_of_Rights#Second_Amendment) or the [4th's right to avoid searches/seizures]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Bill_of_Rights#Fourth_Amendment). The [9th]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Bill_of_Rights#Ninth_Amendment) and [14th]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_Amendments#Fourteenth_Amendment) Amendments outline the limits of what federal and state governments can outlaw.  [Section 1 of the 14th Amendment]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Section_1:_Citizenship_and_civil_rights) firmly declares that no state can “deprive any person of life, liberty, or property.” Cases such as *[Roe v. Wade]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade)* (right to abortion), *[Eisenstadt v. Baird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eisenstadt_v._Baird)* (right to contraceptives), and *[Lawrence v. Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_v._Texas)* (right to sodomize) argue that depriving citizens of access to abortion and contraceptives or interfering in consenting individuals’ sexual affairs amounts to an invasion of privacy that is implicitly prohibited by the 14th Amendment.  So states can't make discriminatory laws, and they can't make laws that would allow citizens to deprive other citizens of their life, liberty or property.

[This](https://www.newsweek.com/us-coalition-admits-killing-more-civilians-iraq-syria-activists-say-numbers-1003519) 2018 article from NewsWeek claims the number of civilian Yemeni casualties admitted by the US is off by as much as 1,000.

It also claims the JSOC and CIA are aware civilians were killed, but refused to publicly admit it. After the incident, Yemen temporarily suspended JSOC airstrikes, but allowed CIA strikes to continue.  &#x200B;  This is all related to Yemen alone, which got me wondering if there’s an estimated number of all civilian casualties inflicted by the US on foreign countries.

What factors led to US-Vietnam relations improving after the Vietnam War? Can the US learn from any of this within the context of withdrawals from Iraq and Afghanistan? The US pulled out of Vietnam in 1973, and the war formally ended in 1975. 40 years later, [polling](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/04/30/vietnamese-see-u-s-as-key-ally/) showed Vietnamese public opinion of America was relatively high.  > Today, the Vietnamese view the U.S. in a positive light. About three-quarters of Vietnamese (76%) expressed a favorable opinion of the U.S. in a 2014 Pew Research Center survey. More highly educated people (89%) gave the U.S. especially high marks. Young people ages 18-29 were particularly affirmative (89%), but the U.S. is seen positively even by those who are old enough to have lived through the Vietnam War. Among those ages 50 and older, more than six-in-ten rated the U.S. favorably.

Does Texas's new abortion ban violate Roe V. Wade? What are the arguments for and against? [A new set of abortion laws](https://apnews.com/article/texas-courts-78abf09bc505fd1b0a66502ff8202b79) took effect on Wednesday, September 1st in Texas.

In addition, rather than have public officials responsible for enforcing the law, private citizens are permitted to sue abortion providers and anyone involved in facilitating abortions. American Medical Association President Dr. Gerald E. Harmon stated the law  >not only bans virtually all abortions in the state, but it interferes in the patient-physician relationship and places bounties on physicians and health care workers simply for delivering care  In a statement, President Joe Biden questioned the constitutionality of the law, stating it  >blatantly violates the constitutional right established under Roe v.

What are the unilateral powers of the Governor of California? The "once long-shot effort" to recall the Governor of California, Gavin Newsom, is [now a "dead heat"](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/17/us/gavin-newsom-recall.html), with [polls](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/27x9k5qt) showing likely voters almost evenly split on whether to remove Newsom from office. Newsom is a Democrat, and among the 46 candidates to replace him if the Republican-led recall is successful, [the leading Republican is polling close behind the leading Democrat](https://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=36cdcb0b-7cfa-4b55-8704-d1f02a9fe6e5), while Newsom's campaign [is advising supporters to abstain on that part of the ballot](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-08-09/newsom-wants-voters-to-skip-the-recall-ballots-second-part-they-dont-have-to). So there is a realistic possibility that California could have a Republican governor later this year.  However, a maverick governor would still be leading a state with [a one-party supermajority in the legislature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Legislature), and their term would last little more than a year before the [regularly scheduled 2022 election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_California_gubernatorial_election). So any substantial move away from the Democratic trifecta's previous policies might have to come through the unilateral powers of the executive branch.  What are those powers? What can a California governor do to enact a different agenda without the support of the legislature? Have the candidates to replace Newsom, if he is recalled, articulated specific plans to change state policy unilaterally?
To what extent did the Taliban benefit directly or indirectly from United States training and arms supplied to mujahideen fighters in 1979-1992? **Questions:**  1. Did the Taliban directly benefit from US training and weapons? If so, in what ways? 2. In what specific ways did it benefit from them indirectly (ex. US-backed forces that later joined Taliban)? 3. (Most important) To what extent did it benefit (ex. portion of its forces that were trained/portion of its weapons of US origin) from 1994-2001? 4. (Bonus) To what extent has it continued to benefit in its current form (ex. 2020-now)?  As always, please answer all questions with supporting evidence from a trustworthy source.  Please keep answers as specific as possible: I am particularly interested in names of particular mujahid groups and/or leaders. I am not interested in Al-Qaeda except as they might be directly relevant to answers concerning the Taliban.  **Background:**  In 1979, the Soviet Union [invaded Afghanistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet%E2%80%93Afghan_War) in response to instability following a [communist revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saur_Revolution) there the previous year, and quickly installed a puppet government in Kabul. After some lobbying from Pakistan's intelligence agency (ISI), the US began to funnel billions of dollars to mujahid groups, initiating [Operation Cyclone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Cyclone#Background) with the aim of [stemming the tide of communism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reagan_Doctrine) and embarrassing the Soviets. Funding was mostly [routed through Pakistan, with each dollar matched by Saudia Arabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Cyclone#Funding). This ultimately contributed to a [mujahideen victory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_Civil_War_\(1989%E2%80%931992\)), and Soviet forces pulled out of the country in 1989, at which point US funding drastically decreased and fully ceased in 1992 with the fall of the puppet government.    Upon taking Kabul, mujahideen forces were not able to agree on a transitional government, and [fighting broke out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_Civil_War_\(1992%E2%80%931996\)) between the various forces. Two years into this conflict, the newly formed [Taliban emerged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban#Afghan_Civil_War_\(1992%E2%80%931996\)) in eastern and southern Afghanistan and thanks in part to [Pakistan ISI funding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_Civil_War_\(1992%E2%80%931996\)#Taliban_/_Pakistan), quickly gained ground.  The Taliban eventually won the war in 1996 with the capture of Kabul, while many remaining mujahideen forces worked together against the Taliban to defend the remaining [1/3rd of the country](https://www.ecoi.net/en/file/local/1154721/1226_1369733568_ppig1.pdf#page=42) they controlled.

President Biden defended his withdrawal [in a memo from the White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/08/14/statement-by-president-joe-biden-on-afghanistan/), stating: "One more year, or five more years, of U.S. military presence would not have made a difference if the Afghan military cannot or will not hold its own country.

Advantages/Disadvantages of Art.V Convention Of States There are two ways to amend the US constitution.  Congress can pass amendments, but a never before used power given to the states by the US constitution allows the states to directly amend the constitution.  34 states are required to call a convention of states, and 38 must approve any given amendment for it to pass.  This can be used by states to bypass congress, amend the constitution, and potentially restrict the powers of the federal government.  [Wikipedia for general background  info](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_to_propose_amendments_to_the_United_States_Constitution)  According to the national archives [here](https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/constitution)  >The Constitution provides that an amendment may be proposed either by the Congress with a two-thirds majority vote in both the House of Representatives and the Senate or by a constitutional convention called for by two-thirds of the State legislatures.   According to [conventionofstates.com](https://conventionofstates.com/states-that-have-passed-the-convention-of-states-article-v-application)  >States that have passed the Convention of States application (15): >Georgia March 6, 2014  >Alaska April 19, 2014  >Florida April 21, 2014  >Alabama May 22, 2015  >Tennessee February 4, 2016  >Indiana February 29, 2016  >Oklahoma April 25, 2016  >Louisiana May 25, 2016  >Arizona March 12, 2017  >North Dakota March 24, 2017   >Texas May 4, 2017  >Missouri May 12, 2017     >Arkansas February 14, 2019      >Utah March 5, 2019  >Mississippi March 27, 2019   We are slowly approaching the required 34 states needed to call a convention of states.

What is the role of federal courts in the implementation of public policy? As [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/19a785_j4ek.pdf) Justice Neil Gorsuch said in *Department of Homeland Security v. New York (2020)*:   >If a single successful challenge is enough to stay the challenged rule across the country, the government’s hope of implementing any new policy could face the long odds of a straight sweep, parlaying a 94-to-0 win in the district courts into a 12-to-0 victory in the courts of appeal.  A single loss and the policy goes on ice—possibly for good, or just as possibly for some indeterminate period of time until another court jumps in to grant a stay. And all that can repeat, *ad infinitum*, until either one side gives up or this Court grants certiorari.   Justice Gorsuch seems to be concerned that nationwide injunctions hinder the implementation of public policy at the federal level.  What, if any, evidence exists for his assertion that the power to issue nationwide injunctions potentially hinders the implementation of federal policy?
What, if any, national legislation regarding social, economic, or environmental issues was first enacted by California? In 1932 [Justices Brandeis and Stone opined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_State_Ice_Co._v._Liebmann) that states could function as legislative laboratories, where citizens could "try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country."   In some instances these state level experiments go on to directly influence or inspire legislation at the federal level; for example, the way that universal health care reform in Massachusetts [influenced the federal Affordable Care Act.](https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/10/23/451200436/mitt-romney-finally-takes-credit-for-obamacare)  In 1959, California passed the Fair Employment and Housing Act, [prohibiting discrimination in employment and housing practices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Fair_Employment_and_Housing_Act_of_1959) based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, and several other protected categories. In 1964 the federal government passed the Civil Rights Act [which also prohibited discrimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964) based on these same protected categories, among others. While the Civil Rights Act may not have been directly influenced by the passage of FEHA in California, it does share several similarities.  * Are there other examples of federal legislation that was first passed in a similar form by California?  * Are there any examples of federal legislation that were directly inspired or influenced by legislation that was first passed in California?

What are the pros and cons of a country having many-but-smaller or fewer-but-larger defense and aerospace contractors? Is there a "Goldilocks" number and size?

Which economic measures, if any, can be monitored by governments to determine the relationship between the availability of federal unemployment benefits and labor supply? Both the Wall Street Journal and New York Times have published recent articles focusing on the impact of unemployment benefits on labor supply. Both articles focus on Missouri, one of the first states to opt out of federal unemployment benefits as of June 12.  The NYT refers to "work-force development officials \[who\] said they had seen virtually no uptick in applicants since the governor’s announcement," while the WSJ cites Jefferies LLC economists claiming that the "number of workers paid benefits through regular state programs fell 13.8% by the week ended June 12". Despite approaching the question from different angles, both pieces also mention the same job fair held two weeks ago by the Element St. Louis Midtown Hotel to support their claims.  While it may still be too soon to draw any definite conclusions, this raises a couple of questions:  Which economic measures, if any, can be monitored by governments to determine the relationship between the availability of federal unemployment benefits and labor supply? What evidence supports the use of these measures ? What confounding variables may lead to incomplete or inaccurate conclusions?

What evidence exists concerning the effects of economic handouts on minimum wage jobs and rehiring? As the US reopens there has been slow job growth driven primarily by a lack of workers available for certain positions:  *"The Labor Department's closely watched employment report on Friday, which showed a plunge in temporary help jobs - a harbinger for future hiring - as well as decreases in manufacturing, retail and courier services employment, sparked a heated debate about the generosity of unemployment benefits."*  Some blame the economic benefits during COVID and some states are removing them:  *"The enhanced jobless benefits, including a government-funded $300 weekly supplement, pay more than most minimum wage jobs. The benefits were extended until early September as part of a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 pandemic relief package approved in March. Montana and South Carolina are ending government-funded pandemic unemployment benefits for residents next month."*  Source for both quotes [here](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-job-growth-far-below-expectations-april-amid-labor-shortages-2021-05-07/)  Is there factual evidence, either current or historical to show if they do or do not have any impact on job growth?

While forty-eight states and Washington, D.C., [already](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/06/15/juneteenth-2021-history-holiday-how-celebrate/7633328002/) recognize Juneteenth as a holiday, it has not to-date been universally provided as a paid day off to public and private employees.  Elevation to Federal status will undoubtedly result in an increase in the number of paid days-off provided to American workers.  With the current typical [2087 working hours per year](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/pay-administration/fact-sheets/computing-hourly-rates-of-pay-using-the-2087-hour-divisor/), this represents approximately 0.3% of total employment time in the United States.  In regards to the economic results of adding an additional paid holiday each year:  * What is the impact of this reduction in total working hours per year? *  Is it expected to make any measurable difference in overall worker productivity?   * Do employees and employers typically "absorb" a change like this by working more hours in the prior week?   * Or is any overall economic impact offset by increased spending on travel and leisure activities with the creation of a new 3-day weekend?
What are advantages and disadvantages of normalizing Cuban relations? Beginning in 2014, the Obama Administration began the process of normalizing relations between the U.S. and Cuba [1]. This was known as the "Cuban Thaw." It included lifting U.S. travel restrictions with Cuba [1], and re-establishing a U.S. embassy in Havana [1].  During President Trump's tenure, he signalled a reversal of the normalizing of relations and re-imposed some travel restrictions [2]. The embassies, however, remain open. In January 2021, the U.S. State Department added Cuba to its list of state sponsors of terrorism [3].

What is known about the effectiveness of national anti-corruption initiatives? The [World Bank defines](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/factsheet/2020/02/19/anticorruption-fact-sheet) corruption as   > the abuse of public office for private gain—covers a wide range of behavior, from bribery to theft of public funds.  It's not uncommon for leaders to run on anti-corruption platforms or implement anti-corruption programs once elected. For example, multiple Presidents ranging from [Bolsonaro of Brazil](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/brazil-bolsonaro-corruption-sergio-moro/2020/11/20/dfd4e9f0-282e-11eb-92b7-6ef17b3fe3b4_story.html), [Xi of China](https://www.npr.org/2021/03/04/947943087/how-chinas-massive-corruption-crackdown-snares-entrepreneurs-across-the-country) and [Lopez Obrador of Mexico](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-politics-corruption/mexican-presidents-anti-corruption-drive-buffeted-by-scandals-idUSKBN26Z1J4) have run on some kind of anti corruption platform or implemented anti corruption programs.   * What are some notable national anti-corruption programs?

What are the stated consequences from the PRC and the US were Taiwan to formally declare independence? [Article 4](https://law.moj.gov.tw/ENG/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?pcode=A0000001) of the ROC constitution, the governing document of Taiwan, states, "The territory of the Republic of China according to its existing national boundaries shall not be altered except by resolution of the National Assembly," which many accept to mean that [the ROC considers both mainland China and Taiwan to be part of its territory.](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/07/taiwans-status-geopolitical-absurdity/593371/)  The[ US's official position](https://www.state.gov/u-s-relations-with-taiwan/) is that "The United States does not support Taiwan independence".  The [PRC's official position](http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/zt/twwt/White%20Papers/t36705.htm) is that "Settlement of the Taiwan issue and realization of the complete reunification of China embody the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation."  Finally, Taiwanese demography shows a pronounced age gap regarding grassroots support for Taiwanese independence.  In 2017, a [Taiwanese news source reported](https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3065202), "For Taiwanese younger than 40, pro-independence support reaches 84 percent. Perhaps most startling, 43 percent of the under-40 generation would support independence even if it meant China would attack Taiwan under the risk of war."  Also, "Almost 70 percent of people younger than 40 consider themselves to be only Taiwanese, and not Chinese, while this figure runs up to 78 percent for people born after martial law ended in 1987."  Considering the ROC is still the governing body in Taiwan on a de facto basis, and that the [ROC constitution is still Taiwan's governing document](https://english.president.gov.tw/page/93), and that neither the US, the PRC, nor the ROC support Taiwanese independence on an official basis, and that the grassroots in Taiwan among its younger generations clearly favor independence, what are the stated consequences from the PRC and the US were Taiwan to formally declare independence?

What is known about the prevalence of critical race theory within American institutions ? **EDIT : This thread has been locked. Despite the explicit wording of the question and moderator warnings, the discussion has veered off into off topic replies and is no longer productive.**  ___  [Encylopedia Britannica,](https://www.britannica.com/topic/critical-race-theory) describes critical race theory (CRT) as an   > ...[intellectual](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/intellectual) movement and loosely organized framework of legal analysis based on the [premise](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/premise) that [race](https://www.britannica.com/topic/race-human) is not a natural, biologically grounded feature of physically distinct subgroups of human beings but a socially constructed (culturally invented) category that is used to oppress and exploit people of colour.

What evidence is there to corroborate the claim that China is committing genocide against its Uighur population? Under two successive US administrations, the SECSTATE has accused China of committing genocide against its Uighur population. ([1](https://www.npr.org/2021/01/21/959134663/pompeo-accused-china-of-genocide-experts-say-that-term-is-complicated), [2](https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/politics/2021/04/02/is-china-committing-genocide-what-you-need-know-uyghurs/7015211002/))  According to the NPR article about Mike Pompeo, "Numerous experts, as well as news reports on this program, have documented the widespread use of everything from detention camps to forced birth control," and according to the USATODAY article about Tony Blinken, "Uyghurs are being detained in camps and prisons," and that there is a "'Birth prevention' campaign" ongoing, however, the Chinese have used both of these methods extensively [against its own Han population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laogai), particularly the latter in the [context of the One Child Policy](https://www.npr.org/2016/02/01/465124337/how-chinas-one-child-policy-led-to-forced-abortions-30-million-bachelors).   This isn't to say that such measures are unimportant or insignificant, rather, that according to experts (again the NPR article), "The burden of proof in genocide cases is high," and "What the United States government did was a political declaration. It's not a legal determination."    For additional context, Adolf Hitler is known to have modeled his genocidal policies after studying the American treatment of its Amerindian population. ([1](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/04/30/how-american-racism-influenced-hitler), [2](https://indiancountrytoday.com/archive/ugly-precursor-to-auschwitz-hitler-said-to-have-been-inspired-by-us-indian-reservation-system), [3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Native_American_genocide))  Also, Marjorie Taylor Greene has recently received widespread condemnation, including from [leadership in her own party](https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/25/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-holocaust-remarks/index.html), for comparing mask-wearing to the Holocaust.

Earlier this month, the Supreme Court [ruled against police](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/20-157_8mjp.pdf) who seized a man’s guns without a warrant while he was in the hospital for a suicide evaluation.

What are the arguments, for and against, the idea that US Republicans are still a "Big Tent" party? As governor, Ronald Reagan [characterized](https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/archives/speech/april-1-1967-address-governor-ronald-reagan-california-republican-assembly) the Republican party as one with "... room in our tent for many views; indeed, the divergence of views is one of our strengths". Generally speaking the GOP ["big tent"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_tent#United_States) "encompassed a wide range of right-wing and center-right causes, including a wide range of politicians who were fiscally conservative and socially moderate or liberal and vice versa." This mentality was echoed by House Leader McCarthy who [stated in February](https://time.com/5956997/kevin-mccarthys-gamble-big-tent-republican-party/) his belief that "This Republican Party’s a very big tent."  This morning, House GOP [removed Rep. Liz Cheney](https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/liz-cheney-gop-vote-05-11-21/index.html) from her leadership position. Rep.

What gives states the legal authority to opt out of federal unemployment programs? So far, by Tuesday May 11th, [half a dozen states](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-unemployment-benefits-states-pushback/) have opted out of enhanced federal unemployment programs.

What are the advantages and disadvantages of a municipally vs federally mandated minimum wage? A federally mandated $15 minimum wage could become a reality in the U.S. However, in [about half of states](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/21/15-minimum-wage-wont-cover-living-costs-for-many-americans.html), the cost of living would still eclipse earnings for workers paid $15 an hour. At the same time, a minimum wage of $15 would cover the living wages of single childless adults in states like Kentucky and Arkansas.  Instead of mandating a $15 minimum wage, what would be the advantages and disadvantages of a federal law that mandates a minimum living wage for every municipality? Every municipality could have its own commission that determines what are the COLs (Cost of Living) for an average person in each area. That way rural Arkansas could keep a $15 an hour wage, but urban areas with higher COLs could have higher wages.

Do the constitutional rights of future generations impose obligations on the US government when it comes to climate change? The German supreme constitutional court [ruled](https://www.dw.com/en/german-climate-law-is-partly-unconstitutional-top-court-rules/a-57369917) today that the German government's climate protection measures insufficiently protect the rights of generations to come, by disproportionately burdening future generations with the actions needed to address climate change. Overcoming these burdens would likely require limiting the freedoms of everyone, and thus inaction now is viewed by the court as a threat to their constitutional freedoms.

A coup d'état in Myanmar began on the morning of 1 February 2021, when democratically elected members of the country's ruling party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), were deposed by the Tatmadaw—Myanmar's military—which then vested power in a stratocracy.

What evidence exists concerning the effects of foreign aid on a receiving country's economic growth? I have been interested in the question, "what helps poor nations grow its economy and facilitate human development?" In the [1960s, the idea that rich countries should help poor countries became popular](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/10/does-foreign-aid-always-help-the-poor/) in the form of foreign aid. But as the same article notes, over the years, [it has been shown](https://assets.weforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/151023-foreign-aid-Africa-Angus-Deaton-Wonk-Blog.jpg)that  as foreign aid per capita GDP increases, per capita growth decreases by  almost the same amount. The article gives an explanation to this:  >"Why  was this happening? The answer wasn’t immediately clear, but   Deaton and other economists argued that it had to do with how foreign   money changed the relationship between a government and its  people...'For instance, most governments depend on their people for  taxes in  order to run themselves and provide services to their people.   Governments that get all their money from aid don’t have that at all,   and I think of that as very corrosive.'"  Angus Deaton, Nobel laureate in economics, even goes on to argue that [more scrutinized foreign aid packages](https://www.cfr.org/event/angus-deaton-foreign-aid-and-inequality) are also not effective since each country is unique and foreign aid might not be effective at all. This article [documents how the Pakistani government is an endless cycle of taking money from the IMF](https://www.dawn.com/news/1439408). Nevertheless,[we do know how instrumental the Marshall Plan was](https://www.britannica.com/event/Marshall-Plan) for Western Europe in helping these countries get back to their feet.  This leads to the question, what evidence exists concerning the effects of foreign aid on a receiving country's economic growth?
Outside of passing new legislation, what mechanisms are available to the US federal government to block or ban a website or app?

What is the constitutionality of the bill, recently passed by the Arkansas legislature, restricting access to gender-affirming medical care for transgender youth? [On March 29th, Arkansas passed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2021/03/29/arkansas-passes-bill-restricting-access-medical-treatments-transgender-children/), by a vote of 28-7, [HB1570](https://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/Bills/Detail?id=HB1570&ddBienniumSession=2021%2F2021R&Search=) ([PDF of bill text](https://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/Bills/FTPDocument?path=%2FBills%2F2021R%2FPublic%2FHB1570.pdf)) (also known as the "SAFE" Act), which primarily prohibits "gender transition procedures" for minors, defined in the bill like so:  >"Gender transition procedures" means any medical or surgical service, including without limitation physician's services, inpatient and outpatient hospital services, or prescribed drugs related to gender transition that seeks to:   >   >(i)  Alter or remove physical or anatomical characteristics or features that are typical for the individual’s biological sex; or   >   >(ii)  Instill or create physiological or anatomical characteristics that resemble a sex different from the individual’s biological sex, including without limitation medical services that provide puberty-blocking drugs, cross-sex hormones, or other mechanisms to promote the development of feminizing or masculinizing features in the opposite biological sex, or genital or nongenital gender reassignment surgery performed for the purpose of assisting an individual with a gender transition.     There is contention between proponents of the bill (such as Republican lawmakers), who claim such practices to be problematic, and medical organizations (among other groups) who recommend such treatments be accessible to trans youth ([source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2021/03/29/arkansas-passes-bill-restricting-access-medical-treatments-transgender-children/)):     >During  Monday’s Senate vote, one of the bill’s Republican sponsors, state Sen.  Alan Clark, described gender-affirming treatments as “at best  experimental and at worst a serious threat to a child’s welfare.” He  argued the bill would “protect children from making mistakes that they  will have a very difficult time coming back from.”   >   >“I  know that their parents are looking for any kind of answer, and my  heart truly goes out to them,” he said. “But this is certainly not the answer.”   >   >But major medical organizations including the [American Academy of Pediatrics](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/142/4/e20182162) and [the Endocrine Society](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/102/11/3869/4157558)  have supported access to treatments such as puberty blockers and  hormone treatments for children diagnosed with gender dysphoria, defined  as the distress caused by a mismatch between one’s sex assigned at  birth and one’s gender identity.  In the above quoted article, another opponent claims that the bill itself is unconstitutional:     >“It violates the Constitution. It singles out a group of young people  solely because you do not understand them and because you find them to  be politically unpopular,” said Chase Strangio, deputy director for  transgender justice at the ACLU.     Is that this case? What are the arguments justifying why this law is unconstitutional (or is, in fact, constitutional)?
What are the implications and constraints of "vaccine passports" and vaccination requirements? The US Department of Health and Human Services [is working on](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/03/28/vaccine-passports-for-work/) a credential system for proof of vaccination, or "vaccine passports", to enable safe reopening of the country by making it convenient for businesses to allow only vaccinated people into their facilities. This comes after the state of New York [already launched](https://pix11.com/news/coronavirus/nys-launches-vaccine-testing-passport-excelsior-pass-for-use-at-venues-theaters-stadiums/) its own such system, "Excelsior Passes", last Friday.  How have US federal and state laws addressed vaccination status for other diseases in the past and what was the result? Beyond simply providing an authentication of someone's claim that they have been vaccinated, are there circumstances in which the law can bar unvaccinated people from certain locations or situations? Or conversely, could a state legislature with a different philosophy ban businesses or employers from asking about vaccination status, treating it as a form of discrimination? How do these legal concerns differ between public services and private businesses?
How does American nationalism strengthen or detract from national security? [Nationalism](https://www.google.com/search?q=nationalism+definition&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS834US843&oq=nationalism+definition&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l9.3166j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) - identification with one's own nation and support for its interests, especially to the exclusion or detriment of the interests of other nations.  [Nation](https://www.google.com/search?q=nation+definition&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS834US843&oq=nation+definition&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l9.1752j1j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) - a large body of people united by common descent, history, culture, or language, inhabiting a particular country or territory.  ---  In western political history, a common narrative is that [nationalism first arose during the 18th century in America and France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism#History), the latter especially under [Napoleon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_nationalism#:~:text=Napoleon%20Bonaparte%20promoted%20French%20nationalism,the%20French%20Revolution%20across%20Europe) utilizing the ability to increase conscription among the masses to gain political power.  One of [NATO's](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/declassified_139339.htm) key tenets is "forbidding the revival of nationalist militarism in Europe through a strong North American presence on the continent", the two above points demonstrating that nationalism and national security are closely intertwined.  In current American discourse, there has been much criticism of domestic terrorism threats emanating from ethnic Euro-centric nationalism, commonly called ['white nationalism'.](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/ideology/white-nationalist)  Another group that has risen to national prominence is the NFAC, a black nationalist militia group [which advocates for black liberation and separatism.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_Fucking_Around_Coalition)  Yet another view of nationalism is that it can be divorced from race and ethnicity and [based upon liberal ideology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civic_nationalism), an "inclusive form of nationalism that adheres to traditional liberal values".  Others point out that [such nationalism is oxymoronic](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/abs/great-delusion-liberal-dreams-and-international-realities-by-john-j-mearsheimer-new-haven-yale-university-press-2018-328p-3000-cloth/6FD4E7A143B7AE5086042C03F83F49C4), that "modern liberal ideology - a function of liberalism's commitments to individualism, inalienable rights for all humans, and state-led social engineering," is incompatible with "the more powerful and abiding forces of nationalism at the center of international relations."  Given the varying views of what constitutes American nationalism, along with nationalistic sentiments being closely tied to militaristic fervor, how does American nationalism strengthen or detract from national security?
What are the overall goals of hate speech laws and what are the established ways of determining their effectiveness? Over the last decade [hate crimes have been steadily rising](https://apnews.com/article/hate-crimes-rise-FBI-data-ebbcadca8458aba96575da905650120d).  Countries have different approaches, for example, Germany has had laws against "incitement of the masses" [*Volksverhetzung*](https://dejure.org/gesetze/StGB/130.html). Germany has recently expanded the [the network enforcement act](https://www.bmjv.de/DE/Themen/FokusThemen/NetzDG/NetzDG_node.html) which was aimed at social media platforms, making it mandatory for [companies to proactively report serious cases of hate speech to the authorities](https://www.politico.eu/article/german-parliament-moves-to-toughen-hate-speech-rules/)   In comparison, the US has many precedents of [protecting hate speech under the First Amendment to the consitution](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/09-751.ZS.html).  Given the two examples above, what are the overall goals of hate speech laws, and what are the established ways of determining their effectiveness?
Does ranked choice voting reduce polarization and lead to more democratic outcomes? Ranked choice, also known as [instant runoff voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting) (IRV), is an preferential vote counting method where voters can rank several candidates from most to least preferred. The algorithm works by eliminating one-by-one the candidate who receives the fewest 1st place preferences, and then transferring the eliminated candidates' voter preferences to the other candidates.   Ranked choice voting is used:  * To elect the members of the Australian House of Representatives  * To elect the president of India * To elect the president of Ireland * Used for elections in Maine and Alaska * Used in cities such as New York.  A multi-choice, proportional representation ranked method is also available called ["Single Transferable Vote"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote) (STV). STV adds a surplus reallocation step, where candidates who receive votes above a quota are elected to office. Then, surplus votes for that candidates above the quota threshold are transferred to other candidates. STV is used:   * To elect members of the Australian Senate * To elect members in various Australian territory local legislatures.  * Some territories in New Zealand * Senate elections in Pakistan * Dail general elections in Ireland * Malta  Proponents of IRV and STV, such as [Fairvote America](https://www.fairvote.org/), claim that ranked choice will "make democracy more fair  and functional", "discourage negative campaigning", "minimize strategic voting", and "promote reflective representation".   In contrast, other voting reform activists such as Warren Smith or the Center for Election Science (another advocacy group) oftentimes attacked instant runoff oftentimes as a sort of poison pill that would wreck voting reform enthusiasm by implementing a mediocre reform. If you go down the rabbit hole long enough, several other alleged better voting methods (in terms of democratic outcomes) come to mind - [Condorcet methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_methods), [STAR](https://www.starvoting.us/) voting, [approval](https://electionscience.org/) voting, etc etc.    -------------  How accurate are the claims made by Fairvote and ranked choice proponents, particularly when comparing to the countries that have implemented IRV and STV? For example how satisfied are Australian and Irish citizens with their parliamentary elections?
How successful have/are fascist governments been in implementing economic reform? How has this compared to their democratic counterparts during the same time period? Churchill once stated that [“Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others.” ](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/267224-democracy-is-the-worst-form-of-government-except-for-all). This had led me to wonder how well this quote holds up in the real world, specifically surrounding economic reforms.  So how have fascist states, both historically, and more recently/currently, fared in implementing economic reform compared to democratic counterparts? Are there any notable examples of one governing philosophy being better than the other at certain metrics, such as standard of living or equality of opportunity?  Note: the definition of fascism being used in this question is based on [what is described in this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics_of_fascism) or [this article](https://www.thebalance.com/fascism-definition-examples-pros-cons-4145419). Please abide as close to this definition of fascism and fascist economics as possible. And for democracy, the definitition is based on [Western/Liberal democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_democracy). Again, please try to abide by this definition as closely as possible.
Is there evidence that the People's Republic of China is preparing to invade Taiwan? Press reports [recently have indicated](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/15/china-growing-threat-taiwan-476170) that "top U.S. military officials are warning with increasing urgency that China could in the next few years invade Taiwan, the island nation whose disputed political status has long been a fraught subject of U.S.-China relations."

Included in the original version of the bill was an increase of the federal minimum wage to $15 over a period of years. President Biden [stated](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-trump-intelligence-briefings/) the minimum wage increase is "not going to occur because of the rules of the United States Senate," referencing the Parliamentarian's ruling.

Do the laws governing publicly funded broadcasters differ from their privately funded counterparts? In the UK, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) receives public funding through [licensing fees](https://www.bbc.com/aboutthebbc/governance/licencefee). Unlike [state media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_media) which are indirectly/directly under the control their governments, the BBC exists as a [statutory corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC#Governance_and_corporate_structure) and is independent of direct government intervention. At the same time, the BBC exists alongside other, privately owned broadcasters like [Sky News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_News) and [ITV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_(TV_channel).

Would government regulation of fact checking organizations be a violation of free speech laws/protections?

While subjective news is [protected under the First Amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment), the preface of labeling an article as a "fact-check" implies objectivity, despite there being no legal requirement of the author to remain objective (as far as I'm aware). In addition there are laws that exist to regulate certain types of speech. For example, [false advertising laws](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/advertising-marketing-internet-rules-road) regulate misleading phrasing to protect consumers from being cheated. With more people relying on these services to know what is true and what is not, would some sort of regulation/certification/verification of objectivity violate free speech laws/protections?
What are the pros and cons of eliminating individual income tax in the U.S.? What would be the effects of doing so? The Libertarian Party says that [no one should pay taxes](https://www.lp.org/issues/taxes/) (income and otherwise) unless they opt in. Arguably the biggest tax removal that the Libertarian Party is arguing for is the removal of the income tax [which is what Gary Johnson ran on in 2016](https://www.thestreet.com/politics/if-libertarian-gary-johnson-was-president-here-rsquo-s-what-would-happen-to-the-u-s-economy-13612038). However, the U.S. individual income taxes make up around [50% of the total U.S. revenue](https://www.thebalance.com/current-u-s-federal-government-tax-revenue-3305762) so its fair to say that removing this revenue source for the Federal government will result in vast change for the U.S. as a whole.  1.

[Hawley told Axios he also would support a $15 minimum wage for workers  of large corporations that generate at least $1 billion in annual  revenue.](https://www.axios.com/hawley-minimum-wage-tax-credits-2087ac1e-a007-4095-b2b8-c0aa6d202dc2.html)     Also he is proposing " The Blue Collar Bonus:"  a three-year program that would increase worker wages in 2021, paid by taxpayers rather than employers.      * Those making below $16.50 per hour would receive a refundable  tax credit worth 50% of the difference, paid out in quarterly  installments. The $16.50 could increase over time, as it would be tied  to the Consumer Price Index. * The credit would only apply to 40 hours or less of weekly work. * Only  American workers with valid Social Security numbers would be eligible,  meaning non-U.S. citizens and undocumented immigrants would be excluded.
What are the arguments, for and against, nationalizing the digital information systems of critical United States infrastructure? The United States continues to face digital attacks from many different fronts. From [2008 to 2019 there were 9696 data breaches amongst the various states](https://news.clearancejobs.com/2019/07/02/which-u-s-states-have-been-hacked-the-most-you-may-be-surprised/). And, more recently, there have been the [Florida water treatment hack](https://www.tampabay.com/news/pinellas/2021/02/08/someone-tried-to-poison-oldsmars-water-supply-during-hack-sheriff-says/), and the broader [Solar Winds attack](https://www.npr.org/2020/12/15/946776718/u-s-scrambles-to-understand-major-computer-hack-but-says-little).  Nationalization of industries is [not an uncommon practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nationalizations_by_country#Japan). For example, [the UK has a national power transmission network that serves the majority of Great Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Grid_(Great_Britain\)). Other countries have [nationalized their health care industries to varying degrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_health_insurance), including the US who has to an extent centralized its health care delivery [to veterans through the VA](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/tech/va-cerner-restart-16b-ehr-overhaul-planned-october-go-live#:~:text=end%2Duser%20training.-,The%20VA%20signed%20a%20%2410%20billion%20deal%20with%20Cerner%20in,integrating%20Cerner's%20MHS%20Genesis%20system.) and [has the federally-run exchanges under the ACA](https://www.peoplekeep.com/blog/bid/317011/how-the-affordable-care-act-aca-varies-by-state).  Given the [cyber attack vulnerabilities of critical infrastructure](https://www.cisa.gov/critical-infrastructure-sectors) and that these vulnerabilities exist at a local/State levels, what are the arguments for and against nationalizing the digital information systems of critical US infrastructures ?  - What mechanisms are available to the federal government to complete such a task? - Are there countries who have attempted to nationalize their own digital information systems? - What obstacles exist if the US Federal government attempted to nationalize this sector? - Are there examples in US History that are relevant to this idea?
Is Georgia's absolute majority requirement for statewide elections fair, appropriate and democratic? In [three U.S. states,](https://www.cbs58.com/news/these-states-have-unique-election-rules) candidates for most offices must receive over 50% of the votes to win the election. In two of those (Georgia and Louisiana), if no single candidate crosses that threshold, a runoff election is held between the top two vote-getters.  For the last election cycle, [both of Georgia's Senate races went to a runoff.](https://www.11alive.com/article/news/politics/elections/two-georgia-senate-races-head-to-runoff/85-072c7379-01d9-47c5-85f8-64ba1825c202)  In the [regular election,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020%E2%80%9321_United_States_Senate_election_in_Georgia) incumbent Senator David Purdue got 88,098 more votes than his challenger, Jon Ossoff. However, that only amounted to 49.73% of the total votes cast, so the election went to a runoff where Ossoff won by 54,944 votes, significantly less than Purdue's margin of victory in the general election.  In the [special election,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020%E2%80%9321_United_States_Senate_special_election_in_Georgia) challenger Raphael Warnock bested the second place finisher, incumbent Senator Kelly Loeffler, by 343,821 votes, but with 20 candidates in the field due to no primary contest in this race, that only amounted to 32.9% of the total vote, so it went to a runoff where Warnock won by 93,272 votes, a significantly closer outcome than in the general election.  As an interesting aside, races like this with no primary are susceptible to manipulation through the use of "shadow candidates." In neighboring Florida, a [local investigative report](https://www.local10.com/news/local/2020/11/11/evidence-suggests-several-state-senate-candidates-were-plants-funded-by-dark-money/) discovered a number of non-existent or disengaged candidates had been registered in open races in an attempt to siphon votes from the favorites. In states where an absolute majority is necessary to win, such a tactic could be even more consequential by forcing a runoff when there otherwise wouldn't have been one.  All this brings up a number of questions:  * What are the pros and cons of the absolute majority requirement for elections? * Does it result in elections that are more or less representative of popular will? * Are systems with this requirement more or less susceptible to fraud or abuse? * What was the Georgia legislature's stated reason for enacting the absolute majority requirement? * Has such a requirement been proposed in other states (not counting Louisiana and Maine, which already have it), and if so, what were the stated cases for and against it?
For Texas, what are the pros and cons of having its own power grid? There are three power grids in the 48 States of the continental US: the Eastern Interconnection, the Western Interconnection — and Texas.   For reasons related to its [desire for independence,](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2003/08/why-texas-has-its-own-power-grid.html) especially from Federal regulators, [Texas has remained mostly separate](https://www.ksat.com/news/local/2021/02/16/why-does-texas-have-its-own-power-grid/) from the larger electricity distribution systems shared across other states. Although it uses more electricity than any other state, the [Electric Reliability Council of Texas](http://www.ercot.com/) (ERCOT) has historically been able to provide cheap power with few service hiccups. In fact, the partially-deregulated system there has allowed the state to [build infrastructure to enable diversification of energy generation](https://www.pnnl.gov/main/publications/external/technical_reports/PNNL-25822.pdf) (PDF pg. 7):  > Where other states are limited by transmission constraints, ERCOT recently completed its CREZ project, which includes 3,600 right-of-way miles of new 345 kV transmission lines that allow significant amounts of wind energy to be moved from west Texas to the load centers in central and east Texas.   Presently, parts of North America are experiencing a [large winter storm,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_13%E2%80%9316,_2021_North_American_winter_storm) which has had a dramatic effect on Southern states that don't normally see this kind of weather. In Texas, this has resulted in [widespread blackouts,](https://abc13.com/texas-power-grid-outages-rolling-blackouts-brownouts/10344285//) blamed in large part on [poor preparation,](https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/local/texas/dallas-texas-electrical-power-outage-ercot-failures/287-50797307-0afe-43eb-8175-b78e7e4fc13a) despite detailed recommendations that were made after a similar 2011 incident.   Yet Texas isn't alone. Fourteen states that are part of an interconnected grid are also [experiencing blackouts due to the storm.](https://www.insider.com/texas-snow-storm-blackouts-states-power-grid-electricity-energy-emergency-2021-2)  This whole situation gives rise to a few questions:  * Are States with interconnected energy grids more resilient in extreme weather or demand conditions? * Is there evidence to suggest Texas would be less susceptible to blackouts if it integrated its systems with other grid operators. * Are there good policy reasons for Texas keeping its grid separate? * In what ways and to what degree does Texas staying outside the reach of Federal energy regulation help its residents?
How have the political views of Biden regarding crime and the law changed over his political career? Biden previously supported the [1994 crime bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent_Crime_Control_and_Law_Enforcement_Act), however that stance has been [criticised](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/20/18677998/joe-biden-1994-crime-bill-law-mass-incarceration) and argued for [having many negatives](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/race/news/2019/05/10/469642/3-ways-1994-crime-bill-continues-hurt-communities-color/). However, Biden more recently stated that it was “a big mistake” and supporting efforts to reel back those penalties.  1: How exactly has Biden's position regarding that particular bill changed over time? What are his stated reasonings for why his position changed? To what extent does he suggest "reeling in" the law, and what are his newer alternatives?  2: In a more broader sense, how has his position's changed over his career? From private prisons, to drug policy, to police immunity, to race inequalities etc. Are any of these positions drastically different from his previous stance on them; if so, how/why?  3: How has Joe Biden compared with the rest of the U.S. Senate regarding his position on crime and the law, and how has this changed over time?
What are the obstacles to indicting a former president for something they did while in office? The official policy of the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel is that a [sitting president cannot be indicted](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-indictment-explainer/can-a-sitting-u-s-president-face-criminal-charges-idUSKCN1QF1D3), but there has been talk of pursuing charges against Trump *after he has left office* [ever since Biden won the presidency](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/bidens-doj-must-determine-whether-trump-should-be-prosecuted) back in November. Biden said he'd leave it up to the DoJ's judgment to do so, but the January Capitol riot has seemingly stirred up a more serious and urgent discussion about it.^[1](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/533456-trump-in-new-legal-jeopardy-after-capitol-riots), ^[2](https://www.yahoo.com/gma/full-investigation-jan-6-capitol-142737592.html), ^[3](https://www.newsweek.com/mitch-mcconnell-warns-trump-didnt-get-away-anything-can-still-criminally-prosecuted-1569159)  [This source](https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/verify/do-former-presidents-have-immunity-or-can-they-be-prosecuted-if-a-president-leaves-office-can-he-be-charged-with-a-crime-explainer-fact-check/65-0ca56bc3-43c2-4bab-84ed-307bb4cae87c) theorizes it is possible, but also admits there's little precedent:  >"Everyone agrees that the president can be prosecuted after he leaves office for at least some acts that occurred before he left office, and obviously for acts that occurred after he leaves office," Prakash said. "The wrinkle is, can he be prosecuted for his official acts?"   >   >Prakash says the Supreme Court never answered the question, but said "no one denies that he can be prosecuted for his private acts. If he shoots someone in his private capacity as president, or if he shot someone before he was president, they can prosecute him after he leaves office.”  * Given that it seems legally possible, what are the obstacles to such a prosecution? Has there been anything close to precedent that would give us a clue as to the possibility of success? * If they can be indicted, can they be re-tried for similar charges that they were impeached, but acquitted for? In other words, does [double jeopardy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Jeopardy_Clause) come into play here? * Does it matter where they are charged? In other words, does the law view the situation differently depending on whether the charges are filed in a Federal, State or local court? * And, finally, [this article](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/10/01/after-trump-prosecute-president-office-bauer-goldsmith-book-424580) contemplates whether its worthwhile to pursue such a prosecution. What are the pros and cons of doing so?
What are the pros and cons of the 3 new farm bills passed in India? GOI passed 3 bills last year related to Farmers,  1. [The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020](https://www.prsindia.org/billtrack/farmers-empowerment-and-protection-agreement-price-assurance-and-farm-services-bill-2020) 2. [The Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020](https://www.prsindia.org/billtrack/farmers-produce-trade-and-commerce-promotion-and-facilitation-bill-2020) 3. [The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020](https://www.prsindia.org/billtrack/essential-commodities-amendment-bill-2020)  **Context**  Agricultural markets in India are mainly regulated by state Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) laws.  APMCs were set up with the objective of ensuring fair trade between buyers and sellers for effective price discovery of farmers’ produce.[\[1\]](http://164.100.47.193/lsscommittee/Agriculture/16_Agriculture_62.pdf)  APMCs can: (i) regulate the trade of farmers’ produce by providing licenses to buyers, commission agents, and private markets, (ii) levy market fees or any other charges on such trade, and (iii) provide necessary infrastructure within their markets to facilitate the trade.  The central government promulgated three Ordinances on June 5, 2020 [\[2\]](https://www.prsindia.org/node/845725/chapters-at-a-glance): (i) the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020, (ii) the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance, 2020, and (iii) the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020. The Ordinances collectively seek to (i) facilitate barrier-free trade of farmers’ produce outside the markets notified under the various state APMC laws, (ii) define a framework for contract farming, and (iii) impose stock limits on agricultural produce only if there is a sharp increase in retail prices.  The three Ordinances together aim to increase opportunities for farmers to enter long term sale contracts, increase the availability of buyers, and permits buyers to purchase farm produce in bulk.  **Highlights of the bills**  * The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020 allows intra-state and inter-state trade of farmers’ produce beyond the physical premises of APMC markets.  State governments are prohibited from levying any market fee, cess or levy outside APMC areas.  * The Farmers Agreement Ordinance creates a framework for contract farming through an agreement between a farmer and a buyer prior to the production or rearing of any farm produce.  It provides for a three-level dispute settlement mechanism: the conciliation board, Sub-Divisional Magistrate and Appellate Authority * The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020 allows the central government to regulate the supply of certain food items only under extraordinary circumstances (such as war and famine).  Stock limits may be imposed on agricultural produce only if there is a steep price rise.   What are the merits and demerits of the bills in their current state?
What rules and procedures, if any, govern the attendance of Senators during an impeachment trial? As many as 15 seats of Republican senators were empty during the first few hours of the trial Thursday, compared to just a handful of Democrats who were outside of the chamber, according to [pool reports](https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewsolender/2021/02/11/gop-senators-increasingly-absent-from-impeachment-trial-as-weariness-grows/) reports.  •	⁠What rules, if any, dictate the attendance of Senators during an impeachment trial?  •	⁠If such rules exist, what are the consequences of violating these rules?
Can the Senate compel testimony of its own members in an impeachment trial? Yesterday [there was a dispute](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/538357-impeachment-trial-descends-into-chaos-over-lee-objection) during the impeachment trial of Donald Trump related to Senator Mike Lee.   In particular, Sen. Lee objected to claims made by the impeachment managers  about a phone conversation he and Sen. Tuberville had with then-President Trump during the Jan 6 riots.  The impeachment managers based their claims on [press reports of quotes from Lee and his staff.](https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2021/02/11/what-sen-mike-lee-told-me/)  If there is a factual dispute about what Trump said to whom and when on Jan 6, and Sens. Lee and Tuberville are witnesses to it, can the Senate request or compel their testimony in the impeachment trial?  If so, what would be the mechanism by which the Senate would compel testimony of its own members?
How do the various proposals to expand/change the child tax credit compare? Right now there are at least two serious proposals being considered in Congress relating to the child tax credit.  Congressional Democrats [have drafted legislation](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/02/08/covid-19-relief-democrats-propose-3-600-per-child-tax-credit/4434504001/) which would change the child tax credit to give families $3600/yr for children under 6, and $3000/yr for children aged 6-17.  Currently the credit [tops out at $2000.](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/child-tax-credit-by-the-numbers)   Notably, the proposal would make the credit be paid monthly so instead of being part of a large tax refund, people would get monthly payments of $300 or $250 per child.  Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) has proposed [a system which would eliminate the Child Tax Credit and several other benefit programs](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/02/04/romney-child-care-benefit-democrats-465940) in favor of a child benefit paid out monthly through the Social Security Administration.  Romney's plan would involve a slightly larger benefit to families with young children ($4200/yr for children under 6), but also would eliminate some benefits that such families receive such as the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, and the Head of Household tax filing status.  What are the benefits or drawbacks of these proposals as compared to one another, and as compared to current law?
What is the stated reasoning behind giving intelligence briefings to former US Presidents?    President Joe Biden doesn't believe former President Donald Trump should receive classified intelligence briefings, as is tradition for past presidents, citing Trump's "erratic behavior unrelated to the insurrection."  [https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/05/politics/biden-trump-intelligence-briefing/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/05/politics/biden-trump-intelligence-briefing/index.html)  Additionally  * How does this work, does the former President request a briefing or do they receive regular briefings? Do they have access to any/all intel? * Is there a historical precedent of former Presidents using or acting on intelligence? * Is there a historical precedent of former Presidents leaking intel? * Have any other former Presidents been denied intelligence briefings? If so, what was the stated reasoning?
What, if any, are the proposed climate change policies of current members of Congress and how do they compare to President Biden's Plan? President Biden has proposed a climate plan that includes, among other things, rejoining [the Paris Climate Agreement, abandoning the Keystone Oil Pipeline](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/02/podcasts/the-daily/biden-climate-agenda.html?showTranscript=1), and the creation of [250,000 jobs in the oil and gas sector](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-climate-plan-to-get-a-boost-from-democrat-led-senate-11610981436).  However, critics like Senator Kennedy of Louisiana the Biden plan will [destroy jobs in his state](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/sen-john-kennedy-foolish-biden-executive-orders-gut-louisiana). Others have argued that the Biden plan will make the U.S. too dependent on China as China controls the [vast majority rare earths element production](https://www.realclearenergy.org/articles/2020/07/20/joe_bidens_climate_and_energy_plan_is_a_gift_for_china_499500.html) needed for “green energy” technology.  Are there any alternate climate plans being proposed in Congress and if so, what are they? What evidence exists supporting or refuting the claims of each of these alternative plans?

What is the Republican Party after the Trump presidency? In the 2016 primaries, Donald Trump's candidacy was blamed for ["sucking the oxygen out of the room"](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/trump-stealing-christies-thunder-msna635616) for all the other Republican candidates, and during his presidency he continued to [dominate much of the news](https://www.forbes.com/sites/andymeek/2020/11/08/this-is-the-end-of-an-era-for-the-us-news-media5-ways-it-will-change-post-trump/) in a way and degree that few other individual politicians have achieved. Now that he has lost his power in government and [his platforms](https://time.com/5927398/facebook-twitter-trump-suspension-capitol/) in social media, what is the state of the party without his leadership? Who are the major players now, whom do they represent, and what are their values and objectives?  Here are some specific questions of fact that might illuminate the topic:  * **Platform** - What are the key points of the national and state Republican Party platforms that distinguish their policy goals and political values? * **Actions** - Although Republicans have [lost their majorities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/117th_United_States_Congress#Party_summary) in both houses of Congress along with the presidency, they still have full control of [many state governments](https://ballotpedia.org/Gubernatorial_and_legislative_party_control_of_state_government): what policies are they enacting in those states? And with their limited power in Congress, what policies are national Republicans either blocking or cooperating on with the Democrats? * **Voters** - What are the demographics of Americans who voted Republican in the 2020 elections? * **Politicians** - Who are the prominent leaders in post-Trump Republican politics? Which Republicans embraced or condemned Trump, and did their positions change during or after his presidency?  * **The Trumps** - The president's daughter [Ivanka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivanka_Trump#Advisor_to_the_President_of_the_United_States) and son-in-law [Jared Kushner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Kushner#Senior_Advisor_to_the_President) served in his White House while his son Don Jr. [became an active political surrogate](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/24/donald-trump-jr-midterms-republicans-667186); are they continuing to participate in Republican politics?

What stated political ideologies are there behind the movements/parties that are pushing for forceful reunification in some countries? China [says](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-taiwan-president-inauguration-idUSKBN22W08X) reunification with Taiwan is inevitable. There’s a real threat of an [invasion](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/10/08/asia-pacific/china-taiwan-invasion-scenario/). Not too long ago, the [annexation](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2020/03/17/crimea-six-years-after-illegal-annexation/) of Crimea took place. Putin says Crimea is [part of Russia historically and forever](https://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-putin-insists-crimea-20141204-story.html). From what I understand, the historical aspect is important to both China and Russia.

On the other side, what are the political advantages/disadvantages for countries that choose to not pursue reunification?

What are some examples of a presidential campaign orchestrating a protest rally? On 22 January, the Center for Responsive Politics published a report, [*Shell companies and ‘dark money’ may hide details of Trump ties to DC protests*](https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2021/01/trump-tied-to-dc-protests-dark-money-and-shell-companies/) that states in part,   > Former President Donald Trump’s presidential campaign aides played key roles orchestrating a rally protesting certification of President-elect Joe Biden‘s victory in the 2020 presidential election before hundreds of rioters breached the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.    ...  > Trump’s campaign disclosed paying more than $2.7 million to the individuals and firms behind the Jan. 6 rally.  &nbsp;  What are some other examples of a *presidential campaign* orchestrating a *protest* rally?
What campaign finance reforms bills are being proposed by Congressional Democrats? Campaign finance reform has recently been an issue for both parties. Politicians from both the [Democrats](https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2019/06/2020-democrats-stands-on-campaign-finance/) and the [GOP](https://theintercept.com/2016/07/19/gop-platform-calls-for-elimination-of-almost-all-campaign-finance-laws/) have indicated support for reform, although [there is debate on what reform to implement](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/2016-campaign-finance-reform_n_578e67abe4b04ca54ebef3bf).  However as of yesterday, 01-20-21, there is now majority control of both the  [executive](https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-inauguration-a01d1ffa7862661914cb92b22e359854) and [legislative](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/democrats-control-senate-after-three-new-senators-are-sworn-n1255054) branches by a single party - the Democrats.  What are some examples of legislation that Congressional Democrats have proposed? And for these examples, are there any evidence of public support?
Does President Biden's new discrimination Executive Order allow transgender individuals to participate in sports leagues of their chosen gender identity President Biden's [Executive Order on Preventing and Combating Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual Orientation](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-preventing-and-combating-discrimination-on-basis-of-gender-identity-or-sexual-orientation/) expands protections against discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation. Section 1 states the policy the order is based on, and at one point states the following:  " Children should be able to learn without worrying about whether they will be denied access to the restroom, the locker room, or school sports. "  This sentence is being taken by some sources ([here](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-executive-order-schools-transgender-athletes-girls-sports), [here](https://www.heritage.org/gender/commentary/after-inaugural-rhetoric-unity-biden-signs-divisive-transgender-executive-order), and [here](https://nypost.com/2021/01/21/joe-biden-sparks-terf-war-with-gender-discrimination-order/) just off the top of a google search) to mean that it is now illegal to prevent a transgender student from participating in a   sports team of their stated gender. I make no claim to the validity of the sources, only that it is a claim being spread.  Given that section 1 seems to state the 'spirit' of the order rather than giving concrete directives, and section 2 does not mention sports, or even schools specifically, would this Executive Order give a transgender person legal ground to challenge a decision made by a public school to prevent them from joining a  school-sponsored team of their stated gender?
Can an Impeachment Trial by the Senate occur after a President's term has ended? On [January 13th](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/13/politics/house-vote-impeachment/index.html), the US House of Representatives voted to impeach now Former-President Trump for the second time. On that same day, former Senate Majority Leader [Mitch McConnell](https://twitter.com/senatemajldr/status/1349476803514146819?s=20) stated his belief that "there is simply no chance that a fair or serious trial could conclude before President-elect Biden is sworn in next week". This belief has played out as [President Biden's inauguration](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-55736856) has now passed without a second impeachment trial of former President Trump.   [Article 1 Section 3 Clause 6](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/article-1/section-3/) of the Constitution outlines the Senate's impeachment responsibility but does not state whether a trial could occur following the end of a President's term.   [Senator Clyburn](https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/pa-gop-sen-pat-toomey-calls-on-trump-to-resign-after-capitol-riot/2662648/) suggested that the House send the articles of impeachment to Senate after the first 100 days of the Biden presidency. However, legal scholars have argued both [for](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/01/13/senate-impeachment-trial-constitutional-after-trump-leaves/) and [against](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/01/12/once-trump-leaves-office-senate-cant-hold-an-impeachment-trial/) the constitutionality of trying a President after they have left office.   * What additional arguments exist on the Constitutionality of conducting an impeachment trial after their Presidential term ends?  * Are there any legal or procedural challenges that need to be addressed in order to try a former President? ___  This is a moderator rework of another user's post who was unresponsive to requests for edits.  edit : This question is now moot as the trial is now set for [Feb. 9th 2021](https://www.npr.org/2021/01/25/960130551/house-poised-to-transmit-article-of-impeachment-against-trump-to-senate)
Presidential transitions and the Logan Act The [Logan Act](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/953) is a 1799 federal law that states the following:  > Any citizen of the United States, wherever he may be, who, without authority of the United States, directly or indirectly commences or carries on any correspondence or intercourse with any foreign government or any officer or agent thereof, with intent to influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government or of any officer or agent thereof, in relation to any disputes or controversies with the United States, or to defeat the measures of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both  Four years ago, during the Obama-Trump transition, incoming National Security Adviser Michael Flynn was [investigated](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/us/politics/fbi-interviewed-mike-flynn.html?smid=tw-share&_r=1) and eventually [resigned](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/02/logan-act-michael-flynn-trump-russia/516774/) for conducting foreign policy during the transition. Specifically, the FBI questioned him related to a phone call with the Russian Ambassador discussing the removal of Obama-era sanctions.  Fast-forward 4 years. Last week, Israeli media [reported](https://www.timesofisrael.com/report-biden-team-already-holding-talks-with-iran-on-us-return-to-nuclear-deal/) that Biden officials have already begun negotiations with Iran on reentering the nuclear deal (JCPOA), which the Trump administration departed in [2018](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trump-ending-united-states-participation-unacceptable-iran-deal/). According to the reporting, they have been in touch with Israel on the topic as well. To my knowledge, the incoming administration has neither confirmed nor denied these reports.  What are the differences between these two situations as they relate to the Logan Act? What, if any, foreign policy are officials for a President-elect allowed to perform prior to the inauguration? How are potential Logan Act violations investigated, and how much control would either the outgoing or incoming administrations have over any investigation?
Must a President publicly disclose presidential pardons? As President Trump nears the final days of his presidency, his power to pardon individuals as come under scrutiny.   [Article II, Section 2 of the US. Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_Two_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Clause_1:_Command_of_military;_Opinions_of_cabinet_secretaries;_Pardons) states the president   > "shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment"  Typically, requests for pardons are submitted to the [Office of the Pardon Attorney](https://www.justice.gov/pardon#:~:text=The%20Office%20of%20the%20Pardon%20Attorney%20assists%20the%20President%20in,Attorney%20for%20investigation%20and%20review.), which prepares recommendations on those received requests. Pardons can take the form of pardons, commutation of sentence, remission of fine or restitution, and reprieve. [President Trump has avoided the normal pardoning process, preferring to directly pardon persons who have not filed petitions with the pardons office or met its requirements.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/most-clemency-grants-bypass-doj-and-go-to-well-connected-offenders/2020/02/03/4e8f3eb2-21ce-11ea-9c2b-060477c13959_story.html)   What the Constitution doesn't address is whether or not a President must publicly disclose those pardons they have granted. Given this, the [question as to whether or not President Trump has issued secret pardons](https://thehill.com/opinion/criminal-justice/534222-how-to-stop-trumps-secret-pardons) has been raised. One of the issues with the possibility of secret pardons is that there is no way of knowing whether those pardons were issued while President Trump was in office, or if he issued them after leaving office.    Must a President publicly disclose Presidential pardons in order for them to be legitimate pardons, or does he still have the power to issue secret pardons?
What countries, if any, have implemented automatic inflation-adjusted minimum wage? So the increasing discussion over the last few years around the minimum wage [\[1\]](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/18/us/politics/minimum-wage.html) [\[2\]](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2020/11/13/even-a-divided-america-agrees-on-raising-the-minimum-wage/) has made me wonder why it's not adjusted every year based on the inflation rate of that year.  It was originally created in [1938](https://www.dol.gov/general/aboutdol/history/flsa1938). For 25 cents an hour, which would roughly be [$4.54 as of 2019.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_wage_in_the_United_States#Historical_trend)  By automatic adjustments I mean a type of [automatic stabilizer](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/automaticstabilizer.asp#:~:text=Automatic%20stabilizers%20are%20ongoing%20government,spending%20over%20the%20business%20cycle) and do not require "additional, timely authorization by the government or policymakers."  In this case, if inflation increased by X, the minimum wage would change by Y.  **Follow up questions**  * What are the challenges these countries faced concerning automatic adjustments? * What was the overall impact seen by countries that used inflation-adjusted minimum wage? * Optional 3rd question - For countries that adopted the inflation-adjusted minimum wage, how does it compare to the country's previous methodology?
Can congresspersons objecting to the certification of the electoral college results be subject to removal via the 14th Amendment? On January 6, 2021, rioters stormed the Capitol. https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/a-day-after-rioters-seized-symbol-of-democracy-the-fallout-begins-on-capitol-hill  There were Congress-persons who objected to certification of the electoral college vote (a major element of the rioter's rationale for protesting) https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/08/us/politics/josh-hawley-capitol-riot.html https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/07/us/politics/republicans-against-certification.html https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2021/01/04/electoral-college-certification-republicans-object-joe-biden-win/4042776001/  There have been several arrests made on Federal charges. https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/thirteen-charged-federal-court-following-riot-united-states-capitol  Rep. Cori Bush has introduced legislation to expel members of Congress who supported the protesters. https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/live-blog/electoral-college-certification-updates-n1252864/ncrd1253122#blogHeader  The 14th Amendment, Section 3 states: "No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability."  https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendment/amendment-xiv#:~:text=No%20State%20person%20shall%.  Do the objections of these congresspersons meet the definition of having "engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the [United States], or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof" under the purview of the 14th Amendment? If so, can they be removed? What evidence needs to be presented, and does it need to be through legislation, or some other judicial body? If judicial, who would present this to what court?
What are the stated advantages and disadvantages of Scotland declaring its independence from the UK? There's been a lot of talk about Scottish independence and [Sturgeon wanting a second referendum](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-scotland-46885261). I find a big issue with understanding it is that many of the arguments made concerning it are by the most passionate people on both sides while the more comprehensible arguments are difficult to find.  Back in 2014, the Scottish voted to stay in the UK with a relatively small margin. 55% voted to remain in the UK. [Source.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/events/scotland-decides/results) Which meant they stayed in the UK. However since then, Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP have been [trying to gain support for Scottish independence](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-politics-24147303) and, [according to polls](https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2020/11/12/scottish-independence-yes-51-49-no), they have been successful in gaining enough support to have a plurality in favour of independence.  But it seems that the 2 major UK parties are opposed to a 2nd referendum. Both [Conservatives](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-55521732) and now [Labour](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-21/labour-party-joins-u-k-opposition-to-scottish-independence-vote) are opposed to a second independence referendum. As a result, it seems less likely that they are going to have a referendum in the near future.  However, [Indyref2 is most likely going to be in the SNP Manifesto](https://www.thenational.scot/news/18638401.nicola-sturgeon-indyref2-commitment-snp-2021-manifesto/) for the upcoming Hollyrood election. If they are able to secure a large majority they will have a mandate and as such, Westminster may be more likely to allow a 2nd referendum.  With this being a potential likelihood in the near future, what are the advantages and disadvantages of Scotland leaving the UK and what's the evidence to support it?
Is "the President told me to do it" a valid legal defense for those charged with entering the US Capitol unlawfully on January 6th? On January 6th, a group of people [stormed the US Capitol building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_storming_of_the_United_States_Capitol) in Washington, DC.  As of two days ago, [82 of them have been arrested.](https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2021-01-07/capitol-arrests-in-dc-riots) Many, like [Derrick Evans,](https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/press-release/file/1351946/download) are being charged with violating [18 U.S.C. § 1752](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1752) (a)(1) and (2), which covers anyone who:  > (1) knowingly enters or remains in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority to do so; >  > (2) knowingly, and with intent to impede or disrupt the orderly conduct of Government business or official functions, engages in disorderly or disruptive conduct in, or within such proximity to, any restricted building or grounds when, or so that, such conduct, in fact, impedes or disrupts the orderly conduct of Government business or official functions  This is a Federal crime, investigated by the FBI and prosecuted by the US Attorney, both of which operate under [Department of Justice,](https://www.justice.gov/agencies/chart) which is part of the [Executive branch.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_executive_departments) The head of that branch is the President of the United States, who made [multiple calls for his supporters to come to Washington on January 6th](https://www.thetrumparchive.com/?results=1&searchbox=%22january%22&dates=%5B%222020-12-18%22%2C%222021-01-10%22%5D) and then [spoke directly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53LPLyIm3jk) to those who did, [saying:](https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-save-america-rally-transcript-january-6)  > We’re going walk down to the Capitol, and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators, and congressmen and women. We’re probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them because you’ll never take back our country with weakness.

They’re never voting for anything, not even one vote. But we’re going to try and give our Republicans, the weak ones, because the strong ones don’t need any of our help, we’re going to try and give them the kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country.  He also at one point told them to be peaceful:  > I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.

What is the evidence supporting and refuting the charge that Muslims in China are being imprisoned in large numbers and having their culture removed via “re-education”? Chinese government denies that Muslim Uighurs are being imprisoned against their will and they suggest the number in these camps are not massive. [source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/19/chinas-uk-ambassador-denies-abuse-of-uighurs-despite-fresh-drone-footage)  Chinese government also defends their position by going after reports against them, in this example Adrian Zenz [source](https://news.cgtn.com/news/2020-09-14/Six-lies-in-Adrian-Zenz-s-Xinjiang-report-of-genocide--TMIv2qWemA/index.html)  Many western media and human rights organizations accuse China of detaining against their will massive number of Uighur Muslims for “re-educating” them to be more Han and less Muslim and some accusations are are of forced sterilization.

President Trump has been banned from Twitter. What are the legal arguments for and against this being a violation of freedom of speech protections in the U.S.? After Twitter permenantly suspended President Trump's account on its platform, [he and various other supporters](https://nypost.com/2021/01/08/muzzled-on-twitter-trump-rails-against-the-platform-in-press-release/) have accused Twitter (as well as other social media platforms) of"[censorship](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-on-twitter-and-cnn), "[not \[being\] about FREE SPEECH!"](https://nypost.com/2021/01/08/muzzled-on-twitter-trump-rails-against-the-platform-in-press-release/), and the President son, Don Jr, has said that ["Free Speech is Under Attack!"](https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1347724256323497989)  My question is simple. What legal arguments and proof is there, if any, in favour or against these claims. How does this ban interact with free speech laws and the First Amendment in the U.S.?
Can impeachment be used to block Trump's pardon powers? This question focuses on what "[except in Cases of Impeachment](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artII_S2_C1_3_1_1/)*"* implies within Article II of the constitution.  Discussion in last months thread, "[What is permissible and what restraints exist for a President granting a pre-emptive pardon to an individual?](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/k4oya4/what_is_permissible_and_what_restraints_exist_for/)" did an excellent job discussing any inherent limitations but did not go into detail on this sub-question.  The powers of impeachment themselves are vague within the constitution where it indicates, "[The House of Representatives shall chuse their Speaker and other Officers; and shall have the sole Power of Impeachment](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artI_S2_C5_1_1/)" (Article I). Recent examples include [the prior articles of impeachment](https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/hres755/BILLS-116hres755enr.pdf) against Trump which list activities like "directing the White House to defy a lawful subpoena by..." and "directing other executive branch agencies and offices to defy lawful subpoenas..." etc.  Does the sentence clause "except in cases of impeachment" block Trump from  pardoning himself or others for these activities? Consistent with the discussion of [open-ended pardons](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/k4oya4/what_is_permissible_and_what_restraints_exist_for/geacjym?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), is it possible to have an "open-ended" impeachment, or to have a specific article reflecting concerns about [alleged pardon selling](https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/01/politics/doj-pardon-investigation-court-filing/index.html), such that Trump is blocked from issuing any additional pardons?  Presumably the final call would be at the Supreme Court; but are there any existing legal theories about this?
The terms sedition, treason and insurrection have been used to describe today's events at the US Capitol. What are the precise meanings of those terms under Federal law and do any of them apply to what happened today? As part of [protests in Washington, D.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_United_States_Capitol_protests ) today, a large group of citizens broke into and occupied the US Capitol while Congress was in session debating objections to the Electoral College vote count.  Prominent figures have used various terms to describe these events:  * President-elect [Joe Biden:](https://www.nbcnews.com/video/biden-condemns-chaos-at-the-capitol-as-insurrection-98957381507) "...it’s not protest, it’s **insurrection**." * Senator [Mitt Romney:](https://twitter.com/SenatorRomney/status/1346958329906565120) "What happened at the U.S. Capitol today was an **insurrection**..." * Wisconsin Attorney General [Josh Kaul](https://twitter.com/WisDOJ/status/1346938954583429121/photo/1): "Those responsible must be held accountable for what appears to be a **seditious conspiracy** under federal law." * Baltimore Mayor [Brandon Scott](https://www.wmar2news.com/news/local-news/mayor-scott-what-is-taking-place-on-capitol-hill-is-what-white-supremacy-looks-like): "...what we’re seeing on Capitol Hill today is an attack on our democracy and an act of **treason**."  What are the legal definitions of "insurrection," "seditious conspiracy," and "treason?" Which, if any, accurately describes today's events? Are there relevant examples of these terms being used to describe other events in the country's history?
What is the jurisdiction of the Secret Service on foreign soil? Iran has filed a "red notice" with Interpol that [requests](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-iran-arrest-warrant-interpol-b1782723.html) the arrest of Donald Trump and 47 other American officials.

Does the UK fulfil the EU accession criteria? If the UK wanted to rejoin the EU, they would have to fulfill the EU's [accession criteria](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/enlargement/ec/pdf/cop_en.pdf):   >Membership requires that the candidate country has achieved **stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy**, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities, the existence of a functioning market economy as well as the capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union. Membership presupposes the candidate's ability to take on the obligations of membership including adherence to the aims of political, economic and monetary union.  [(wiki)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_criteria)  As the UK was already a member of the EU when these accession criteria were signed in 1993, one can not trivially assume that they would be fulfilled.   **Do UK institutions guarantee the stability of democracy in accordance with the entry standards of the EU? If not, what would the UK need to change in order to comply with those standards?**  Have other countries with similar institutions cleared the criteria? What clarifications of the accession criteria exist (case law, etc)?
What policy changes are included in the final version of the US National Defense Authorization Act? The US Congress has [just voted](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/senate-overrides-trump-veto-defense-bill/) to override a Presidential veto and pass the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 into law. This bill authorizes a $740 billion annual budget for the Department of Defense, but it also includes specific provisions setting US federal policy on various issues related to national security. Congress.gov has a [legislative summary](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/6395) of the bill and Wikipedia [describes some of the history and provisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_M._(Mac\)_Thornberry_National_Defense_Authorization_Act_for_Fiscal_Year_2021).  Now that all these new provisions have entered the law, what are the substantial policy changes created by the 2021 NDAA? And what controversial policy changes were proposed but ultimately excluded from the final version of the bill?
What are the pros and cons of Congress refusing to vote on a bill passed by the other house, from the perspective of the average American citizen? [Much](https://apnews.com/article/c842a0bcecc840628a991092da3e7ce3) has been [said](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/10/senate-republicans-legislative-agenda-graveyard-1356894) over the past number of years regarding Mitch McConnell's blocking of votes being held on [numerous bills](https://www.argusobserver.com/news/new-report-16th-congress-is-least-productive-in-history/article_a3f0880a-f9c0-11ea-8cde-cf00c3fd793c.html) [passed by the House of Representatives](https://www.politifact.com/article/2019/nov/14/what-congress-doing-besides-impeachment/). This procedure prevents the elected officials from having an official record of their stance on the bill.    How does this procedure benefit and/or harm the American people?
EITC, UBI, NIT. Which of these economic policies are most effective at reducing poverty? Hi everyone,      There is a [complex set of factors](https://borgenproject.org/top-factors-that-lead-to-poverty/) at work when it comes to poverty.

What is the cause of the lower rejection rate of mail ballots in many states this year? According to the table on this [Ballotpedia](https://ballotpedia.org/Election_results,_2020:_Analysis_of_rejected_ballots) page, the mail ballot rejection rates in many states have significantly decreased in 2020 as compared to 2016/2018.  We consider two states where the margin-of-victory was smaller (I would list Arizona/Wisconsin, but there is no data for ballot rejection in 2020 yet).  &#x200B;  |State|2016 Rejection Rate|2018 Rejection Rate|2020 Rejection Rate| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |Georgia|6.42%|3.10%|0.60%| |Pennsylvania|.95%|4.45%|.28%|  &#x200B;  This fact is part of the reasoning given by Senators Perdue and Loeffler in a [lawsuit](https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20428531-supp-loeffler-perdue-suit-ga#document/) against the state of Georgia, specifically claiming that signature verification procedures were illegally loosened by local election officials (see page 22 of the linked document).  If you scroll through President Trump's twitter, you will see several tweets where he makes grievance with the signature verification process. [Here is the most recent one.](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1344397397280088070) He calls out Georgia in that tweet, but he more generally attacks the process in several states (including Pennsylvania) among his other tweets.  What caused the decreased rejection rates? Is it local officials (illegally?) loosening restrictions on their own initiative as claimed, or something else?
What is the historic precedent of submitting a written objection to the electoral college certification? [On the afternoon of January 6th, 2021](https://www.npr.org/2020/12/22/949134479/congress-role-in-election-results-heres-what-happens-jan-6), both the House and Senate will assemble in the House chamber to formally count the votes of the Electoral College. Both [Rep. Mo Brooks](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/these-incoming-freshman-lawmakers-to-join-mo-brooks-in-challenging-election-on-jan-6) and [Sen. Josh Hawley](https://www.npr.org/sections/biden-transition-updates/2020/12/30/951430323/gop-sen-hawley-will-object-to-electoral-college-certification) have indicated that they will object to the certification of the results. If written, objections from both chambers would trigger a debate and vote, with majorities in both chambers needed to uphold the objection.  * Beyond the recent 2005 Democratic objections, what is historic precedent of submitting a written objection to the electoral college certification? What were the results of each chambers votes?   * Is there any evidence to suggest that something was directly gained or lost due to these objections?  edit - Corrected Sen. Hawley and Rep. Brooks statements about objecting. Whether those objections will be written is currently not known.
What are the checks and balances against the US President's power to use Homeland Security or the military to override the election result? Last Monday the [Electoral College chose](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/12/14/us/elections/electoral-college-results.html) Joe Biden as the next President of the United States. However, the current President Donald Trump's term in office [continues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twentieth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) until January 20. After the failure of [numerous lawsuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-election_lawsuits_related_to_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election) attempting to change the vote counts from the November 3 election, the current president has been considering his options to use his command of the US military or the Department of Homeland Security to override the election results, according to [the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/19/us/politics/trump-sidney-powell-voter-fraud.html) and [Axios](https://www.axios.com/trump-officials-alarmed-overturn-election-results-a844d1d2-acb2-47a9-87ce-ac579458b1ea.html).  What are the constitutional or political checks and balances that present resistance to these options? In other democracies whose head of government has successfully or unsuccessfully used executive powers to overcome an election loss, how did analogous resistance play out? And in the US, what is the level of support for this option among officials in other branches of government?
What other forms of unelected house are there, aside from the UK's House of Lords? The UK's upper house, the [House of Lords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lords), is formed of unelected members. [Over 85% of members](https://lordslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/lln-2020-0111/) are [life peers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_peer) appointed for life by the monarch, on advice from the sitting Prime Minister or [the Appointments Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lords_Appointments_Commission). The rest are either [hereditary peers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hereditary_peer), or appointed as a result of holding certain religious positions.  Aside from these systems, what other current or proposed methods of forming an unelected house (upper or lower) are there?
What role, responsibility, and/or legal authority does the Vice President have on the Jan 6th Congressional joint session? On January 6 2021, the Senate and the House will convene a joint session to count the electoral votes and officially declare the winner of the 2020 Presidential election.   As this [article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/electoral-college-presidential-election-results-trump-challenge/) states  "Procedure calls for Vice President Pence to open each state's "certificate of ascertainment" — documents prepared by the state after it has completed its vote count and ascertained the official results. He will then present the certificate to four "tellers," who announce result tallies. Once a candidate reaches 270 electoral college votes, Pence will declare the winner. "  * Are there procedures in place if a Vice President refuses or is unable to fulfill this role?    * What , if any, procedures are in place to verify the certificate presented to the four tellers? Has a Vice President ever falsified the certificate?  ___ This is a rework of a question proposed by another user. They declined to be credited.
What is the evidence supporting and refuting the allegations of election fraud during the 2020 US Presidential Election? [Donald Trump has requested](https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/09/politics/trump-filing-supreme-court-electors/index.html) the Supreme Court of the United States block millions of votes in Battleground states that voted for Biden. This is joining a lawsuit brought forth by [The State of Texas in the "Texas vs. Commonwealth](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/22/22O155/163367/20201210142206254_Pennsylvania%20Opp%20to%20Bill%20of%20Complaint%20v.FINAL.pdf) **PDF Warning**  Trump has repeatedly claimed that [voter fraud, and a coup is taking place](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1337042714924380166) while news sources are claiming [No evidence of voter fraud](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/10/us/politics/voting-fraud.html) and the Supreme Court has already [tossed out](https://www.inquirer.com/news/pennsylvania-election-lawsuits-trump-mike-kelly-pennsylvania-supreme-court-mail-in-ballots-20201128.html) one particular case involving mail-in voting.   My question is this. What is the evidence supporting and refuting the allegations of election fraud during the 2020 US Presidential Election?
What happens to down ballot results if a State's election process is declared unconstitutional by the SCOTUS? The [Texas AG is alleging that Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan and Wisconsin](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/images/admin/2020/Press/SCOTUSFiling.pdf) violated the [electors clause](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artII-S1-C2-1-2-1/ALDE_00001121/). As part of the request to SCOTUS he is requesting Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan and Wisconsin "conduct a special election to appoint presidential electors" or if electors have been appointed, to ask the State legislatures to "appoint a new set of presidential electors". Ignoring the validity of these claims and this specific court case, that lead to wonder  What happens to state and local results if a state's election is found to have violated the electors clause?
What are the alternative models to Section 230 for internet content regulation in the US? Internet content hosts in the United States are currently protected by [Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_230), a [frequently misunderstood](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200531/23325444617/hello-youve-been-referred-here-because-youre-wrong-about-section-230-communications-decency-act.shtml) law that makes the providers of an online platform immune from liability for illegal content posted by its users, and gives the providers broad leeway to moderate the content on their platform as they see fit.  [Over the past year](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/02/trump-silicon-valley-section-230-442436), some Republican politicians have pointedly criticized this laissez-faire regime and suggested legislative or executive action to increase the government's regulation of online speech, culminating last week in the outgoing President Donald Trump's threat to veto the pending routine national-defense bill unless it includes a repeal of Section 230.  What specific alternatives to the current system have been proposed? How have other forms of communication been regulated in the US? How is online speech regulated in other democracies? And how are these various models constrained by the [First Amendment to the US Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Freedom_of_speech_and_of_the_press)?
What is permissible and what restraints exist for a President granting a pre-emptive pardon to an individual? In light of Rudy Giuliani reportedly asking President Trump for a pre-emptive pardon, I was wondering what limitations (if any) exist regarding federal pardons for crimes which do not yet have an indictment.  Source: https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/01/rudy-giuliani-and-trump-discussed-pardon-after-loss-to-biden.html  I note that the article referenced above states:  >"The most famous example of that occurred in 1974, when President Gerald Ford pardoned his immediate predecessor, Richard Nixon, who resigned in disgrace after the Watergate scandal. Nixon was the target of a criminal investigation, but had not been indicted at the time Ford granted that controversial pardon.  >Ford’s successor in the White House, President Jimmy Carter, issued preemptive pardons to hundreds of thousands of American men who dodged the draft during the Vietnam War."  Is there anything else to pre-emptive pardons or is it pretty much without restrictions?
Is the United States Military a threat to the United States Constitution? The US military oaths for [enlistment](https://www.todaysmilitary.com/joining-eligibility/enlisting-military) and for [commissioned officers](https://www.army.mil/values/officers.html) affirm that any and all uniformed personnel are sworn to "support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic".  This sentiment has recently been affirmed by two high-ranking US military personnel, former SECDEF and four star general [James Mattis](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/06/james-mattis-denounces-trump-protests-militarization/612640/) and the current CJCS [Mark Milley:](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2020/10/12/zero-chance-of-military-intervention-disputed-election-results-milley-says.html)  >"Of all the countries in the world, I think that we are the only one or at least one of the very few that swears an oath of allegiance to an idea that's embedded in a document called the U.S. Constitution," Milley said. "We don't swear an oath of allegiance to an individual, a king, a queen, a president or anything else. We don't swear an oath of allegiance to a country, for that matter. We don't swear an oath of allegiance to a flag, a tribe, a religion or any of that [but rather to a cherished set of ideas]."  The US Constitution was written by a group now called 'the Founding Fathers', many of whom [wrote profusely](https://guides.loc.gov/federalist-papers/full-text) regarding perceived and theoretical threats to the Constitution. In[ Federalist #41](https://guides.loc.gov/federalist-papers/text-41-50),  Madison argued that "A standing force, therefore, is a dangerous, at the same time that it may be a necessary, provision," and that "A wise nation [...] does not rashly preclude itself from any resource which may become essential to its safety, [yet] will exert all its prudence in diminishing both the necessity and the danger of resorting to one which may be inauspicious to its liberties."  For a [legal opinion](https://digitalcommons.law.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1218&context=faculty_scholarship) on the degradation of checks and balances on the military:  >...The history and text of the Constitution establish a military that is controlled by both the legislative and executive branches of government as a means of preventing abuses by either.  And [yet another opinion](https://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1641&context=mlr), questioning whether or not the post-9/11 military threatens general rule of law:  >Three years after an attack that traumatized the nation and prompted massive military and law-enforcement counter-measures, we continue to wrestle with the central dilemma of the rule of law.  >...The question which remains unanswered, and which defenders of present U.S. policy have considered unnecessary even to address, is why there would be sufficient reason to abandon the wartime checks and balances that we ourselves, along with other Western democracies, have until now considered an essential component of the rule of law.  On the other hand, the US has had [a large standing military since World War II](https://www.hamiltonproject.org/charts/u.s._national_defense_outlays) and the only thing approaching a Constitutional crisis since then was the [Watergate scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watergate_scandal) and resulting resignation of President Nixon, in which the military wasn't involved at all.  Given the current role and environment in which the US military operates, is it a threat to the US Constitution? If so, how can such a threat be mitigated? If not, how do we ensure that, going forward, the US military continues to be used in a way that upholds the oaths by which uniformed personnel swear and also conforms to Madison's vision of a 'wise nation'?
How is the sincerity of religious belief determined in the court of law? In the United States ["sincerely held religious beliefs"](https://news.utexas.edu/2017/06/09/what-are-sincerely-held-religious-beliefs/) afford individuals a wide variety of legal protections and privileges. This includes but is not limited to [safeguards against employment discrimination](https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/questions-and-answers-religious-discrimination-workplace), [guaranteed dietary accommodations](http://www.aele.org/law/2007JBJUL/2007-07MLJ301.pdf), and [exemption from military draft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientious_objection_in_the_United_States). It's important to note that while these examples primarily deal with faith based objections, [adherence to religion is not requirement.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Seeger)  In this context, how is the sincereness of stated beliefs verified in the court of law, and what legal tests exist, if any, to prevent an individual or organization from opportunistically claiming such convictions? Additionally, how do these systems handle explicitly satirical religions, such as [The Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster](https://www.spaghettimonster.org/about/)?   And finally, in light of the recent [supreme court decision](https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/26/politics/supreme-court-religious-restrictions-ruling-covid/index.html) and [targeted orders exempting churches from COVID restrictions](https://www.tampabay.com/news/health/2020/04/02/ron-desantis-quietly-signed-second-executive-order-targeting-local-coronavirus-restrictions/),  what are the minimum requirements for an organization to be included as a religious institution?
What precedent is there for the Vice President to take a more active role in presiding over the Senate? According to Article 1 of the Constitution. The Vice President of the United States is the President of the Senate and has the authority to preside over its proceedings including recognising Senators to the floor and maintaining decorum and order in the chamber.   Mitch McConnell is the Majority Leader of the Senate which has no place in the Constitution and is merely modern tradition and in the Senate Rules. The President pro tempore is another Constitutional official traditionally tasked with presiding over the chamber in the absence of the VP. However it seems as though McConnell is doing all of the presiding.   It is reported that Mitch McConnell has halted more than 400 bills passed by the House of Representatives not bringing them to vote in the Senate.   With Kamala Harris coming in to office in January. She will have the Constitutional authority to preside over the Senate. But the Senate also has rules for itself.   Questions:  1.	What can VP Harris do or not do in her role as President of the Senate beyond the traditional tie breaking? Ignoring any political side effects.  2.	is there modern precedent for a VP playing an active role in the Senate acting as a Check on the legislature?

What are the advantages and disadvantages of allowing the head of state to formally introduce legislation?  In the United States, [the Constitution](https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/the-legislative-branch/) does not allow the [President (head of state)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States) to introduce legislation into [Congress (legislature)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress) and instead limits this ability to Congressional members. However, this is not the case in all similar national systems. For example, the President of Brazil can introduce legislation into the [National Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Congress_of_Brazil).   * Are there other systems ,like Brazil, where heads of state are permitted to introduce legislation into the legislature? If so, how is this power granted?   * What evidence exists concerning the advantages and disadvantages of allowing a head of state the ability to introduce legislation into the legislature?   * Is there evidence to suggest that heads of state who can introduce legislation into their legislature are more or less successful in advancing their political agenda?  * Are there examples in which heads of state have misused this  power?  ___ A thank you goes out to /u/tollyno for allowing me to rework a discussion we had around their previous submission.
Are there examples of an outgoing POTUS launching a substantive military operation during their lame duck period? If so, what was the result? Since Election Day, the [President has fired senior Pentagon officials, and in their place has chosen appointees considered to be “Iran hawks”](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-pentagon-adviser-troop-withdrawals-trump). The President has also ['asked for options on strike on Iran nuclear site'](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-54972269), and his "advisers argued that military action could lead to a broader conflict in the region in the last weeks of his presidency, according to the officials."  Although the election result has yet to be certified, I was curious if there are examples of an outgoing POTUS launching a substantive military operation during their lame duck period? If so, what was the result?
How has the focus of US Presidential campaigns on specific states changed over time?  The recent US Presidential election placed a heavy focus on winning [swing states](https://www.vox.com/21428915/electoral-college-trump-biden-2020), in the form of both candidate time and money [focused on](https://www.nationalpopularvote.com/map-general-election-campaign-events-and-tv-ad-spending-2020-presidential-candidates) these states. This focus on certain key swing states has been [largely unchanged](https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/voting-history-of-the-15-battleground-states) since the 2000 election.  As you [scroll back](https://www.270towin.com/historical-presidential-elections/timeline/) through electoral maps, there appears to be a major shift in 1996, where the winning maps start to represent broad geographic coalitions, not minor variations on the 2000 map. Going back to 1948, only 1960 and 1976 show a somewhat even geographic split.  How have the focus of US Presidential campaigns on specific states changed over time? Did the presidential campaigns in 1948 - 1996 pay special attention to certain swing states, or were the campaigns more national in nature?
What is the current status of the incumbent US President's efforts to challenge the election results? The current US president Donald Trump is [widely](https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/07/politics/joe-biden-wins-us-presidential-election/index.html) [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/results-president.html) by [numerous](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-wins-presidency-trump-fox-news-projects) [outlets](https://www.wsj.com/articles/joe-biden-wins-2020-presidential-election-ap-says-11604766914) to have lost his bid for re-election in the November 3 vote, and many world leaders [have already congratulated](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nicholasreimann/2020/11/07/welcome-back-america-world-leaders-rejoice-after-biden-wins-presidential-election/) Trump's opponent. However, many [US senators](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/11/12/iowas-chuck-grassley-says-would-premature-wish-joe-biden-congratulations/6265189002/), as well as world leaders including the presidents of [Mexico, Brazil](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/mexico-brazil-leaders-silent-as-world-congratulates-biden/2020/11/08/9d97cbfe-2200-11eb-9c4a-0dc6242c4814_story.html), and [Russia](https://www.newsweek.com/putins-russia-last-major-country-yet-congratulate-biden-winning-2020-election-1547301), and notably the [head of the agency](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/gsa-official-blocking-bidens-transition-privately-plans-post/story?id=74234794) that would oversee the presidential transition process have treated the apparent election outcome as premature, in most cases citing the Trump campaign's ongoing lawsuits challenging that outcome.  Two weeks later, the situation is still in limbo: What is the status of those lawsuits now? Which have already been resolved, which are yet to be decided, and what is the overall theme or strategy of the campaign's legal arguments across the country? Practically speaking, how many votes remain contested in each case? Is it enough to swing the outcome, and if so, by how much?

Pfizer [announced](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/11/09/pfizer-coronavirus-vaccine-effective/) on Monday that their vaccine for COVID-19 is more than 90% effective in clinical trials. President Trump [claimed](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1325962203346972678?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) that Pfizer intentionally delayed news of their results until after Election day to harm him politically.  Regardless of the truth of the President's claim, I am curious:   * Are there Federal or State legal ramifications if a private company delays release of news of this form for partisan reasons? If so, what are the associated penalties?  * How would the 1st amendment come into play, if at all?
Are there any legal barriers or state-level confines that prevent any of the 48 Winner-Take-All states from transitioning to the Congressional District Method (or other method) for their electoral votes? Nearly all states use a Winner-Take-All system for the electoral college, where the candidate with the plurality of votes receives 100% of the electoral votes. The two exceptions are [Maine and Nebraska](https://www.270towin.com/content/split-electoral-votes-maine-and-nebraska/), which allocate two electoral votes to the winner of the popular vote, and then one electoral vote per congressional district. This system, called the [Congressional District Method](https://www.fairvote.org/maine_nebraska), on the surface seems to be more representative of the will of the people within the state, since even the most polarized states still have sizable proportions of voters for the other party.   However, the use of congressional districts seems like an opportunity for swing states to gerrymander their electoral college vote. Based on [recent Supreme Court cases](https://www.lawfareblog.com/state-legislatures-cant-ignore-popular-vote-appointing-electors), my understanding (not a lawyer) is that state legislatures have the power to decide on the methods for allocating their state's electoral votes. We are also at the start of a new redistricting cycle, where [many state legislatures](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/11/11/where-democrats-will-be-locked-out-power-redistricting-battles-next-year/) will have the power to draw congressional district boundaries how they see fit.  There are several recent examples of partisan tactics previously considered extreme. For example, [North Carolina](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/03/opinion/north-carolina-gerrymander-map.html), [Michigan](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/04/michigan-gerrymandering-case/588082/), and [Wisconsin](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/05/us/wisconsin-power-republicans.html) have shown an openness to employ openly partisan measures to maintain control, and they've been important [swing states](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/swing-states-2020-election/) in [past presidential election cycles](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-tipping-point-states-favor-trump/).   ---  So since the Supreme Court seems to have decided that [partisan gerrymandering of Congressional Districts is effectively legal](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-allows-gerrymandering-north-carolina-maryland-n1014656), my question is:  **Are there any legal barriers or state-level confines that prevent any of the 48 Winner-Take-All states from transitioning to the Congressional District Method (or other method) for their electoral votes?**
What are the legal implications of using the Equal Protection clause in order to invalidate or stop counting votes? In the 2000 election, the [US Supreme Court decision was made](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_v._Gore)   to stop a manual vote recount in Florida, which was the deciding factor in that election. The difference in original votes was less than 1%, triggering a recount, but the Supreme Court rendered this moot as counting votes from counties with different criteria violated the [equal protection clause](http://fathom.lib.uchicago.edu/1/777777122240/).   Is there a legal basis for applying this same criteria to stop counting votes, or invalidating votes, in other counties/states?
What are the legal arguments for and against using the National Defense Education Act of 1958 to forgive student debts? One of the promises made by president-elect Biden on the campaign trail was some form of [student loan forgiveness](https://joebiden.com/beyondhs/#). Per this [NPR article](https://www.npr.org/2020/11/10/933423976/what-a-biden-presidency-could-mean-for-education) the President could direct the Secretary of Education to forgive any student loans through the National Defense Education Act of 1958.   * So what are the existing legal arguments for and against using the National Education Defense Act of 1958 to forgive student debts?  * Does Congress have sole responsibility for such an act? If not, are there similar acts/precedent that grant the executive branch the ability to forgive debts?
Is there precedent for a sitting President to refuse to give up power? Despite an irrecoverable gap in enough states for an electoral victory, Donald Trump has still refused to come out and concede the election: [link](https://apnews.com/article/trump-supporters-refuse-to-accept-defeat-cc7e4298261cb6b2254507cea6e98ac9).  It appears that the Trump administration has also blocked funding and other resources to allow the Biden administration to begin the transition process: [link](https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/10/politics/donald-trump-transition-biden-block/index.html).  The white house has also asked federal agencies to proceed with budgetary plans that assume a Trump presidency: [link](https://www.adn.com/nation-world/2020/11/10/white-house-tells-federal-agencies-to-proceed-with-plans-for-trump-budget-in-latest-election-defiance/).  My question is:  * Is there any precedent in the United States of a sitting elected official blocking the transition process for the subsequent elected official? Has this happened at the presidential or state level? * Realistically, what processes are in place to ensure the transition of power? * In what ways could the President prevent the inauguration of the president-elect? For example, could the president remove secret service protection?
Trump just fired SECDEF. How does this affect his control over the military before January 20th? [The President has fired Secretary of Defense Mark Espers](https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/09/politics/trump-fires-esper/index.html) and replaced him with Christopher Miller, formerly of the National Counterterrorism Center, who will serve as acting director.  * To what extent does such an action affect the President's current control over the military in both foreign and domestic concerns?  * What implications does such control have over the peaceful transfer of power that normally happens on January 20th?
Does The President Have Legal Ability To Reorder A Census In A Non Census Year? Is there any legal standing or precedent for a President to have the census re-done in a non census year?   Article I section II outlines when the census should be done and why but the wording makes it seem as though it could be carried out sooner than in ten years.   &#x200B;  "The actual Enumeration shall be made within three Years after the first Meeting of the Congress of the United States, and ***within*** every subsequent Term of ten Years, in such Manner as they shall by Law direct."  [^(Article 1 Section 2)](https://www.census.gov/history/pdf/Article_1_Section_2.pdf)     It only states that it must be ***WITHIN*** every subsequent term of ten years which makes me wonder if that means it could be done at any point within ten years, so long as it is done before 2030? Has a President ever done it sooner than ten years?
Operation Warp Speed and US Vaccine Development On Monday, Pfizer announced that recent [data](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/11/09/pfizer-coronavirus-vaccine-effective/) from their potential COVID-19 vaccine shows 90% efficacy. However unlike competitors such as GSK and AstraZeneca, Pfizer did not take money from [Operation Warp Speed](https://www.hhs.gov/coronavirus/explaining-operation-warp-speed/index.html) but instead used $2 billion of it's own money. Assuming the vaccine meets safety and efficacy requirements, Pfizer also signed a contract to provide [100 million doses](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/07/22/pfizer-biontech-vaccine-contract-coronavirus/?itid=lk_inline_manual_40) at a cost of $1.95 billion.  Pfizer also mentioned that [Americans will receive the vaccine for free consistent with U.S. government’s commitment for free access for COVID-19 vaccines.](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-announce-agreement-us-government-600)  This led me to wonder  * What aspects of Operation Warp Speed are favorable or unfavorable to companies looking to participate?  * How does the US government define who it considers an American with regards to the free distribution of a COVID-19 vaccine? For example are green card or visa holders included?  * How does this arrangement (e.g. 100% private development and then free access) compare to the initial development and distribution of other notable vaccines? For example the polio vaccine or the small pox vaccine.

Historically, what have been the most effective ways for US Citizens to affect the outcome of an election in another state? The January Georgia US Senate runoff will probably have a [profound effect on US politics](https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-donald-trump-politics-virus-outbreak-e870e7000fef811b721d92ee36ce6808),  > Control of the Senate likely won’t be decided until a January runoff in Georgia, even after Democrat Joe Biden won the White House on Saturday.  > That post-election cliff-hanger will determine the balance of power in Washington, as neither party appears to have a lock on a Senate majority right now.  > So far, the tally for the next Senate is 48 Republicans and 48 Democrats after Tuesday’s election.

Is a legally mandated “right to be forgotten” useful, effective, and compatible with democratic principles? There has been increasing discussion regarding a person’s “right to be forgotten”—that is, the supposed importance of certain types of information being “forgettable” so that, for example, an adult doesn’t have to worry about their off-the-cuff remarks from their teenage years coming back to unfairly ruin their reputation. (See, for example, [this 2017 report](https://law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/The-_Right-to-Be-Forgotten_-and-Blocking-Orders-under-the-American-Convention-Emerging-Issues-in-Intermediary-Liability-and-Human-Rights_Sep17-.pdf) from inside Stanford Law School.) (There was also [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/25khr6/on_the_internet_should_there_be_a_right_to_be/) post in r/NeutralPolitics in 2014.)  I bring this up again because Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez [tweeted](https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1324807776510595078) on Friday, November 6 2020:  > Is anyone archiving these Trump sycophants for when they try to downplay or deny their complicity in the future? I foresee decent probability of many deleted Tweets, writings, photos in the future  Commentators and publications [are responding](https://nypost.com/2020/11/06/aoc-facing-heat-for-wanting-to-archive-posts-by-trump-sycophants/):  > Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is facing heat for urging her supporters to create an archive of online postings by “Trump sycophants” who may later regret their affiliation with the president. > ... > Commenters quickly decided the list-making endeavor was something a ruthless Communist dictator would love.  While I of course acknowledge that nothing in the US can legally stop someone from archiving someone else’s public tweets to be used against them later, I don’t know how I feel from a liberty standpoint about a politician implicitly calling for the vast archiving of speech that fits a certain criteria (pro-Trump), presumably to be used against the authors or their associates years or decades later. (Her tweet does not make clear whether she is using “Trump sycophants” to include public figures only, or rank-and-file voters as well.)  * In the European Union, how far does the “right to be forgotten” go? Specifically, if you have a right to request the deletion of data about you, does that right extend to prevention of your speech being “archived” in some way? * What different proposals (whether legislation or something else) have been put forward to allow some type of “right to be forgotten” (e.g. in the US), and how would those proposals fit into existing law? * Is the “right to be forgotten” in conflict with freedom of expression generally (e.g. the freedom of others to archive, index, or catalog your speech)?
Are any of the State voting laws adopted directly/indirectly in response to COVID written in a way that extends them indefinitely? The Washington post reports that over[73% of the country voted](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/elections/early-voting-numbers-so-far/) before election day.  The additional early voting and mail in ballot measures were largely motivated as a method to and to deal with short staffed polling places due to the same.  For example, Time Magazine states that [Due to COVID-19, several more states, including California and New Jersey, are adopting this model for the 2020 election.](https://time.com/5889969/how-to-vote-by-mail/)  Are any of the State voting laws adopted directly/indirectly in response to COVID written in a way that extends them indefinitely?
What are the arguments for and against each US State’s system of conducting a federal election? The United States Constitution [https://www.usa.gov/voting-laws] gives each State the responsibility of overseeing Federal elections.  During the 2020 election season, both parties have challenged how States administer federal elections, with a previous challenge by Democrats in North Carolina(https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-samuel-alito-amy-coney-barrett-north-carolina-elections-4cb4c214446bcfadbd73dafca9353701) and a recent lawsuit filed by the GOP in Pennsylvania (https://apnews.com/article/election-day-legal-challenges-b85ec8351882d5508fde27e8dd6b251d). This lead me to wonder  •	⁠What are the arguments for and against each US State's system of conducting federal elections? •	⁠Is there any evidence to suggest that there is something inherent to a States' election system that makes it more prone to court challenges?
What happens if the Senate refuses to review and consider any of a new President's cabinet? We saw McConnell [refuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland_Supreme_Court_nomination) to consider Obama's appointee to the Supreme court. [Rumours](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/mcconnell-reportedly-eyes-constraints-possible-biden-cabinet-picks-n1246581) are that if Biden were to win, and the GOP retains control of the Senate, they might try a similar tactic with the cabinet.  * What happens if the Senate refuse to review potential cabinet member? * What options/political mechanisms are available to any administration to address such a situation? * Does the Supreme Court have a role in cabinet nominees? If so, are there any relevant cases to consider?
What arguments can be made for and against the lawsuits being filed by the Trump campaign regarding election count? In the last few days, the Trump campaign has filed at least 8 lawsuits related to the counting of votes in the election ([https://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/2020-election-results-coverage/#294903](https://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/2020-election-results-coverage/#294903)).

2020 NeutralPolitics Election Night Megathread *Omnes una manet nox - The same night awaits us all.*  **President:** tbd  **Senate:** tbd  **House: Democrats**  After a long election period marked by a global pandemic we now hopefully reach the end of the process and a decision as to who will govern the United States for the coming years.  I will be doing live updates here as the night goes on.  We are likely not expecting complete results in some key states, especially Pennsylvania, where mail ballots were not allowed to be processed before today and will take several days to be counted fully.  **Results Pages**  [Decision Desk HQ](https://results.decisiondeskhq.com/)  [NPR News](https://apps.npr.org/elections20-interactive/#/president)  [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/results/president?iid=politics_election_national_map)  [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/results-president.html)  **News livestreams**  [Fox News](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmrGeWxd87Y&feature=youtu.be)  [CBS News](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlqwXQeD6rY&feature=youtu.be)  [PBS News](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WbNBp5mSqg&feature=youtu.be)  [NBC News](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwRA-dtub7Y&feature=youtu.be)  **Helpful resources**  [Poll closing times by state](https://www.270towin.com/poll-closing-times)  [Fivethirtyeight analysis of how much results from each state we can expect tonight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-results-timing/)  [Downballot races of interest (somewhat left leaning, but very informative)](https://whatsontheballot.com/)  **6:30 PM EST**  Welcome to the megathread all, and buckle in for a long night.    While we are still waiting for the first states to fully close polls, I want to ask users to refrain from calling states for particular candidates until we have calls from the major media outlets who do these forecasts.  As far as I know, the outlets doing high quality election night decision desks are: ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, the Associated Press, and Decision Desk HQ.  If you know of another you want added to this list please mention it in the comments.  Because there are likely to be significant partisan skews by vote method and what methods get tabulated first in different states, it is much more difficult this year than normal to call states, and I want to encourage everyone to be a little more patient than usual on election night.  **7:00 PM EST**  First wave of full state poll closings.  Looks like AP is calling Vermont for Biden and Kentucky for Trump.  NBC has called Indiana for Trump but not seeing that call from AP.  **7:16 PM EST JRB:3, DJT: 11** In several Florida counties (Pinellas and Hillsborough at least that I can see) Biden has already exceeded the total number of votes cast for Clinton in 2016.  Trump will need very good election day turnout to overcome these numbers.  We shall see if that happened.  **7:21 PM EST JRB: 3 DJT: 11**  [The infamous NY Times needles are back](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/forecast-president.html) but only for 3 states.  **7:23 PM EST JRB: 3, DJT: 11**  Looks like [a quite disappointing result](https://twitter.com/Nate_Cohn/status/1323782789934784512) for Biden in Miami-Dade county is driving the estimate that his odds of winning FL are quite slim according to the NYT.  **7:40 PM EST JRB: 16, DJT: 24** Virginia called for Biden, Kentucky and West Virginia for Trump, all expected.  Shelly Moore Capito (R) has won re-election for her WV senate seat.  **7:48 PM EST**  I found [this helpful tool showing different outlets' calls of states.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/upshot/network-race-call-tracker.html)  Given the big differences between them so far, I am not going to be putting electoral vote counts in the timed updates.  **8:15 PM EST**  Looks like Trump is extremely likely to win Florida, yet to be seen if this is something particular to FL (especially Miami) or a national trend that Trump is overperforming polls.  **8:25 PM EST**  Decision Desk HQ is the first major outlet to call a swing state, with FL being called for Trump by them.  **9:12 PM EST** Took a little dinner break there.  Trump appears to be performing pretty well in the south with the NYT projections indicating him likely to win NC and GA as well as looking like pretty much a lock for Trump to win FL.  **9:36 PM EST** Looks like some calls for Hickenlooper to unseat Gardner in the CO-Sen race, which would be the first Senate flip of the night.  **10:21 PM EST**  We are getting a lot of votes in, but with the huge differentials from different voting methods, very few race calls and not a lot definitive to say, except that we can pretty much exclude some of the Biden blowout scenarios.  **11:32 PM EST**  Fox News (but no other outlet yet) has called Arizona for Biden, which would be his first pickup.    With that result, and with Biden trailing in GA and NC, it seems within the zone of plausibility that we could see a 269-269 tie.  That would result in invoking the contingent election process laid out in the 12th amendment.  In that case, the House would pick the President, and the Senate would pick the Vice President.  The House would however not vote like they normally do.  Instead, each state would vote as a state bloc.  And an absolute majority of states would be required to win.  **12:00 Midnight EST** OH has been called by Fox, DDHQ, and NBC for Trump and I see no reason to dispute that call.  **12:09 AM EST** Fox and DDHQ have called Texas for Trump.  All outlets have called NH for Biden.  Still unsure about the Fox call for Biden in Arizona - seems aggressive to me but we shall see.  **12:12 AM EST** The NYT needle in Georgia is now tilting slightly to Biden, and reports are that Fulton County (part of the Atlanta metro) is not going to report more results tonight and has sent their election workers home until tomorrow.  So I would expect about no chance of a GA call tonight.  Given that we will not know PA/WI/MI tonight either, I think we can fairly safely say the election result won't be known tonight.  I'll stay up til I can find someone making a formal call on the House of Representatives at least, though I've seen nothing to indicate it will not be in Democrats' hands.  **12:15 AM EST** AP has called Minnesota for Biden.  **12:27 AM EST** Fox has retracted their call for Biden in Arizona.  **12:38 AM EST**  NBC has called control of the House of Representatives for Democrats.  I don't see anyone contradicting that call, nor any evidence of a bunch of flipping seats that would lead me to question it, so I am gonna put it up top.  **12:41 AM EST**  Most outlets are calling Iowa and Florida for Trump.  **12:42 AM EST** We are not going to know the result of the election tonight.  We may not know it for a couple of days yet with certainty.  I am going to end the tick-tock here and encourage everyone to get a good night's sleep.  **12:53 AM EST**  One small update.  I was mistaken about the Fox Arizona call being retracted.  Fox has not retracted the call, and they are still saying Biden has won Arizona.
Historically, how have the second terms of Presidents compared to their first term? President Donald Trump is currently [running for re-election](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-republican-nominee-president/story?id=67473973), so it got me thinking as to how the second term of former Presidents have been compared to their first term.

President Trump's new reclassification of Schedule F federal workers President Trump has issued an [Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-creating-schedule-f-excepted-service/) on creating a new schedule, schedule F, that will reclassify a portion of the career federal workforce, giving agency heads the ability to hire and fire them at will under a new class in the excepted service.  The order covers "men and women in the Federal service employed in positions of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character."  A long-serving federal executive and three-year Trump administration appointee, Ron Sanders, chairman of the Federal Salary Council, [is resigning from his post over the president’s recent executive order on the career workforce.](https://federalnewsnetwork.com/workforce/2020/10/salary-council-appointee-resigns-calls-schedule-f-executive-order-a-red-line/)  Federal News Network cited that the order allows agency heads to hire and fire employees in Schedule F appointments at will.  The American Federation of Government Employees [called the executive order](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/22/us/politics/trump-executive-order-federal-workers.html) the “most profound undermining of the civil service in our lifetimes,” describing it as an effort by the president to “politicize and corrupt the professional service.”  >The National Treasury Employees Union is [suing the Trump administration](https://www.nteu.org/media-center/news-releases/2020/10/27/nteu-sues-trump-administration-to-safegu) over the president's recent Schedule F executive order.  The lawsuit reads “Under the law, the president may only except positions from the competitive service when ‘necessary’ and ‘as conditions of good administration warrant.’ The president’s sweeping order fails to make a meaningful showing that shifting large numbers of federal employees into a new excepted service category so that they can be fired more quickly and without cause is necessary or supported by good administration principles.”  Important to note that the executive order isn't without praise by others.  On [Federal Computer Week](https://fcw.com/articles/2020/10/21/trump-schedule-f-civil-service.aspx?m=1) there quoted a certain Trump political ally(Rep. James Comer, R-Ky.) praised the order as "draining the swamp."   Three questions:  1. Scope. How many positions exactly may be subject to reclassification under schedule F?  What departments falls under positions of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character and what doesnt?  2. Powers: What powers does the new schedule give to agency heads of civil servants reclassified? The order mentions "at will", is it the same as the United State's "at will" employment laws, or is it just the same in name only?  3. Legal: Given that the administration is getting sued, how legal is the order, and how true is the NTEU's lawsuit wordings about the order?
Has the People's Republic of China faced any backlash from Muslim countries over Xinjiang? The People's Republic of China is building many detention centers, largely as part of its crackdown on Muslims in Xinjiang [https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/china-is-building-vast-new-detention-centers-for-muslims-in-xinjiang/](https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/china-is-building-vast-new-detention-centers-for-muslims-in-xinjiang/)  These have drawn significant criticism in the Western press [https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/10/americans-have-lost-sight-what-fascism-means/616846/](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/10/americans-have-lost-sight-what-fascism-means/616846/)  I am curious what the response to them has been in Muslim-majority countries, many of which (e.g. Pakistan [http://mofa.gov.pk/pakistan-and-china-diplomatic-relations/#:\~:text=Pakistan%20and%20China%20enjoy%20close,the%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China.&text=During%202018%2C%20bilateral%20trade%20between,countries%20reached%20US%24%2018%20billion](http://mofa.gov.pk/pakistan-and-china-diplomatic-relations/#:~:text=Pakistan%20and%20China%20enjoy%20close,the%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China.&text=During%202018%2C%20bilateral%20trade%20between,countries%20reached%20US%24%2018%20billion).) have strategic partnerships with the PRC?
What is the state of the FEC? I understand that the Federal Election Commission needs an approved council to act on certain matters, what powers does the FEC have right now and what is it lacking in oversight?  ["Under normal circumstances, the commission would have at least four members, the minimum required to meet, issue advisory opinions and approve enforcement action. But circumstances at the agency aren’t normal: For most of the last year the FEC has only had three members, rendering it nearly powerless."](https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-08-05/federal-election-commission-camapign-finance-enforcement)
What is the legality of claiming a private club as residence in regards to voting in Florida? President Trump has cast his ballot in Florida claiming his Mar-A-Lago resort as his residence. However, [as this article states](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/trump-made-florida-his-official-residence-he-may-have-also-made-a-legal-mess/2020/05/07/17d53fb2-849c-11ea-878a-86477a724bdb_story.html), Mar-A-Lago is taxed as a private club, not as a residence.   - How do Florida laws define a legal resident in regards to voting?   - Is there evidence or precedent in Florida establishing the legality or illegality of an individual claiming residence in a private club as it relates to voting?
Is a federal mask mandate legally permissible? Is a federal mask mandate legally permissible, enforced by the federal government with penalties for those who don't comply?  The New York Times reported today that one COVID-19 plan asks governors to create a mandate and enforces them in some federally funded areas like interstate highways:   > Mr. Biden said he would ask every governor to institute mask mandates; if they refused, he said, he would work with local officials to get local mandates in place nationwide. And he said he would require masks in federal buildings and on interstate transportation.  https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/10/24/us/trump-biden-election  Is a mask mandate that goes further, by federally mandating mask regardless of governor or local compliance, legally permissible?
Why are certain industries exempt from California's AB5? While looking at the California's [Proposition 22](https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_22,_App-Based_Drivers_as_Contractors_and_Labor_Policies_Initiative_\(2020\)), I've been revisiting the original [AB5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Assembly_Bill_5_\(2019\)) lay that was passed in California that led to the entire reclassification of contractors to employees, especially in the Gig Economy by codifying the ABC test.  As I was doing so, one major question that stood out to me is why are certain industries, such as [Freelance Photography](https://petapixel.com/2020/09/10/freelance-photographers-now-exempt-from-cas-controversial-ab-5/), [Gig Musicians](https://californiaemploymentlaw.foxrothschild.com/2020/04/articles/advice-counseling/musicians-reach-deal-on-ab5-exemption/), or [Freelance Writing](https://laist.com/2020/09/01/california_legislature_passes_ab2257_freelancers_ab5_exemptions.php), either exempted or expecting exemptions from the law? Is it due to just the historical existence of these roles as contract employees, or is there some other facet that delineates them?
[Megathread] Discuss the Final 2020 Presidential debate Tonight was the televised [debate](https://www.c-span.org/debates/) between sitting President Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden.  r/NeutralPolitics hosted a live, crowd-sourced [fact checking thread of the debate](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/jgakue/2020_final_us_presidential_debate_real_time_fact/) and now we're using this separate thread to discuss the debate itself.  Note that despite this being an open discussion thread instead of a specific political question, this subreddit's [rules on commenting](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_comment_rules) still apply.
2020 Final US Presidential Debate Real Time Fact Checking Thread We have concluded the final real time fact checking thread.

Streams of the debate can be found at :  [NBC/Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCA1A5GqCdQ)  [CSPAN/Youtube](https://www.c-span.org/debates/)  [Fox News/Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nY2AXIx-GU4)  The way this will work is as follows:  ***MODERATORS WILL POST FACTUAL CLAIMS AS TOP LEVEL COMMENTS***  Each top level comment will contain a significant factual claim from one of the candidates. In addition, the mods will try to provide more context where necessary.  Moderators will be transcribing live, so we ask for patience as we will do our best to capture as many substantial, relevant and verifiable claims as we can. AutoMod will remove all top level comments not by mods.  ***USER REPLIES TO TOP LEVEL COMMENTS***  Users (you) can reply to the stated claims by laying out the related facts and [linking to qualified sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_sources), but **we discourage those replies from judging the veracity of the claim**. Leave that determination to the readers.  So, instead of stating whether a claim is "true" or "false," a good a second level response would be something like, "Candidate A seems to be referring to this study [source], which has been called into question by some experts [source]."  *Second level comments without links will be summarily removed.*  ***DISCUSSION BETWEEN USERS***  Users can then reply to each other in third-level comments and below.  ---  Please remember that /r/NeutralPolitics rules still apply and all participants should adhere to the standards you have asked us to enforce. No matter the comment level, replies must be courteous, substantive, and supported by evidence.  The thread is default sorted by "new" and you may want to use an auto-refresh extension for your browser to keep up.  The mods will also post a separate discussion thread immediately after the debate is over.  Thanks for participating.
First Amendment and Electioneering. Hello!  I was reading this (https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/14/us/election-what-not-to-wear-trnd/index.html) and most states restrict campaigning within a certain distance from a polling place to allow people to vote without interference. Depending on where you live, that can include wearing or displaying anything with a political message.  The states use a policy refered to as electioneering. https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/electioneering.aspx   What is the status and history of these anti-electioneering laws with respect to the freedoms guaranteed under the First Amendment (https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment)?

What are the consequences if the US Supreme Court rules the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional? The 2010 [Affordable Care Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordable_Care_Act), colloquially called Obamacare, was a major revision to the US health insurance system. The ACA was a project of the Democratic Party when they held the White House and majorities in both houses of Congress, and repealing it [has since been](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efforts_to_repeal_the_Affordable_Care_Act) a project of the Republican Party. When the political situation was reversed, Republicans [attempted but narrowly failed](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/us/politics/obamacare-partial-repeal-senate-republicans-revolt.html) to repeal the full ACA in 2017, then successfully removed only its "individual mandate" (a tax penalty for uninsured Americans) in [their major tax reform later that year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Cuts_and_Jobs_Act_of_2017).  Since then, the fight has continued in the Judicial Branch: in [*California v. Texas*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_v._Texas), a federal appeals court ruled that the removal of the individual mandate did not render the entire ACA unconstitutional because that portion is "severable" from the rest of the Act. However, the Supreme Court is scheduled to review the case during their 2020-2021 term, with oral arguments scheduled for November 10. This means that Judge Amy Coney Barrett, who [has criticized](https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/10/politics/affordable-care-act-amy-coney-barrett-obamacare/index.html) a previous Supreme Court decision upholding the ACA, would be among the Justices ruling on *California v. Texas* if she is soon confirmed by the Senate - thus her nomination has [brought this court case to the foreground](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/520672-democrats-warn-of-obamacare-threat-from-barrett-trump) four weeks before arguments and three weeks before Election Day.  What are the stakes in this case? If the Supreme Court rules the entire ACA unconstitutional, what current regulations in the US health insurance system will revert to the status quo ante bellum of 2009, and what effect have they had over the past decade?

What are the national security implications of a US president being personally responsible for loans and other debts upwards of $400 million? Recently, the NY Times [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/27/us/donald-trump-taxes.html) that Trump,  > is personally responsible for loans and other debts totaling $421 million, with most of it coming due within four years. Should he win re-election, his lenders could be placed in the unprecedented position of weighing whether to foreclose on a sitting president.  &nbsp;  In the [Donald Trump NBC Town Hall](https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15), he seemed to confirm the NY Times report,  > *So I would not mind at all saying who it is, but it’s a very small… When you look at vast properties like I have, and they’re big, and they’re beautiful, and they’re well located. When you look at that, the amount of money, $400 million is a peanut. It’s extremely underlevered. And it’s levered with normal banks. Not a big deal.*  &nbsp;  **What are the national security implications of a US president being personally responsible for loans and other debts upwards of $400 million?**
What is the evidence supporting and refuting the allegation that Hunter Biden influenced his father, then-Vice President Joe Biden, to pressure the Ukrainian government to fire the prosecutor investigating Burisma? [Hunter Biden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden) is the son of Democratic Presidential nominee Joe Biden. He served on the board of Burisma Holdings, a major Ukrainian natural gas producer, from 2014 to 2019.  Two days ago, the NY Post published [a story](https://nypost.com/2020/10/14/email-reveals-how-hunter-biden-introduced-ukrainian-biz-man-to-dad/) alleging:  > Hunter Biden introduced his father, then-Vice President Joe Biden, to a top executive at a Ukrainian energy firm less than a year before the elder Biden pressured government officials in Ukraine into firing a prosecutor who was investigating the company, according to emails obtained by The Post.  Publication of the story itself has been controversial. Various news organizations have [questioned the provenance of the information](https://slate.com/technology/2020/10/hunter-biden-new-york-post-emails-scoop-computer-repair.html) in it, while Facebook and Twitter initially [blocked its redistribution,](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/521072-twitter-facebook-clamp-down-on-new-york-post-article-about-hunter-biden) but Twitter later [reversed course.](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/10/twitter-facebook-block-ny-post-hunter-biden-article.html) Prior to the publication of this latest story, similar reports about Joe Biden's actions in Ukraine were considered by many to be a [debunked conspiracy theory.](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/may/07/viral-image/fact-checking-joe-biden-hunter-biden-and-ukraine/)  But despite the controversy, the question remains whether there's convincing evidence one way or the other around the allegation in the story. What are the solid, verifiable facts to support or refute the Post's narrative?
California Drop Boxes I was wondering about the legality of the drop boxes that the California GOP has installed in California. Per [this article](https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/520721-california-republicans-ordered-to-remove-unofficial-ballot-drop-boxes) and others, election officials, who are democrats, have ordered them to be removed and written a cease and desist order. The Republican Party maintains that they are legal under CA election law and seem to have no intention of removing them. So who is right? Is this explicitly forbidden under law, or a reasonable interpretation of election law? If not explicitly forbidden by law, do election officials have the authority to order their removal?
Nancy Pelosi yesterday proposed the creation of a "Commission on Presidential Capacity," which would allow Congress, "to determine whether the President is [...] unable to discharge the powers and duties of office." Would granting congress this power conflict with the 25th amendment? [Text of the bill is here.](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1987)  >###Oversight Commission on Presidential Capacity Act  >This bill establishes in the legislative branch an Oversight Commission on Presidential Capacity to determine whether the President is mentally or physically unable to discharge the powers and duties of office.  >The commission: (1) within 72 hours after Congress adopts a concurrent resolution directing it to do so, shall conduct a medical examination to determine if the President is temporarily or permanently impaired by physical illness or disability, mental illness, mental deficiency, or alcohol or drug use to the extent that he or she lacks sufficient understanding or capacity to execute the powers and duties of the office of President; and (2) within 72 hours after completing the examination, shall report its findings and conclusions to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate.  >Any refusal by the President to undergo such examination shall be taken into consideration by the commission in reaching a conclusion.  ---  The 25th Amendment establishes procedure for when a serving president is killed in office or otherwise incapacitated: Section 1 reaffirms the order of succession through the vice president; Section 2 establishes that there must always be a vice president; Section 3 allows the vice president to act as president temporally if the president "transmits [...] that he is unable to discharge the powers and duties of the office."  Section 4 deals in principal with the same situation as §3, but in the case where a president is *unwilling* or *unable* to declare themselves unfit for office, despite being incapacitated. The Vice President, along with a majority of cabinet ministers "or of such other body as Congress," can transmit their opinion to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House, and invoke the same circumstance as above: the VP takes over as acting president until the president is deemed to have recovered.    [Text of the 25th Amendment is here.](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxxv)  ---  **What I'm wondering is whether Congress alone can act to trigger this clause of the 25th amendment, as well as how far their jurisdictional power extends over the health of the president.** Speaker Pelosi, with this commission, suggests a mechanism whereby Congress can always pass a resolution to mandate the President undergo a medical examination, for the purpose of informing a decision on the 25th amendment. It would not invoke §4 on its own, but given a vote of Congress to declare the President temporarily unfit, would only require the sign-off of the Vice President in order to remove a President from office.
What are the threats from politically oriented extremists in the US, and are there any elected officials who express sympathy for them? The US Federal Bureau of Investigation recently [announced it had broken up a plot](https://apnews.com/article/michigan-checks-and-balances-archive-gretchen-whitmer-da09ca66cd8d5f36722021d3593425ff) by "violent extremists" to kidnap a state governor because they disagreed with her handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, while the state filed charges for a related plot to storm the state capitol. This comes only weeks after the US Department of Justice [listed several cities](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/justice-dept-deems-new-york-city-portland-seattle-anarchist-jurisdictions-n1240600) as "anarchist jurisdictions" because of how their governments responded to violence and vandalism during protests.  What are the strains of extremism on both ends of the political spectrum in the US? Are they ideologies that motivate lone wolves or organizations that recruit members? And do any of them appear to find some sympathy among elected officials?
What Happens if a Presidential Candidate is Found Guilty of a Crime After Winning the Election But Before Being Sworn In?    Donald Trump called on the US AG, Bill Barr, to indict Joe Biden. [^(1)](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-bill-barr-arrests-fox-news-clinton-obama-biden-obamagate-b885971.html)  The US constitution only sets forth 3 requirements in order to be President.[^(2)](https://www.usa.gov/election#item-212587)  * Must be a natural-born citizen of The United States * Be at least 35 years old * Have been a resident of the United States for 14 years  There is no restriction on anyone convicted of a felony or otherwise under indictment from running and/or being the President of The United States.     Based on Article II section 4 of the constitution [^(3)](https://usconstitution.net/const.html#Article2), disqualification and removal from office occurs only via Impeachment and according to Article I section 2,  The House of Representatives has the sole power of Impeachment [^(4)](https://usconstitution.net/const.html#Article1)     Does the law address what happens if a presidential candidate wins the election and is either indicted or found guilty of a felony between the time of winning the election and being sworn in?
What are the mechanisms available to the Executive Branch to influence the results of a national election? Fivethirtyeight paints the following possible scenario:  - Trump has an electoral college victory on election night based on in-person votes, declares victory - Biden pulls ahead in the following days due to Democrats overindexing on mail-in votes - State legislatures appoint a different set of electors at Trump’s behest due to claimed widespread election fraud - Battles break out in state/Supreme Court  (They also call out the possibility of Biden contesting the results of the election after a significant popular vote win but electoral college loss, but suggest he would be relatively powerless in doing so.)  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-if-trump-loses-and-wont-leave/  I suppose this question potentially has a two-part answer: 1) What is the Executive Branch’s influence in this scenario if acting alone? 2) What if state legislatures / Supreme Court fall in line with the Executive Branch?
What is the evidence that Biden's policies or actions are or aren't racist?

How does the 'Equal Time Rule' define broadcaster coverage now that President Trump has declined to participate in the 2nd Presidential Debate?     The Commission on Presidential Debates announced Thursday morning that the second Presidential Debate will be held virtually. The style of this debate was/is to be a town hall event.  However, shortly after the change was announced, Trump said he would refuse to participate, indicating he would not "waste \[his\] time with a virtual debate." His campaign has indicated it may hold a rally instead.  Recognizing that the FCC's equal time rule seems to exempt debates:  * If Trump declines to participate and the event instead becomes a Biden town hall on broadcast television, does the Equal Time Rule dictate that broadcasting network must offer equal air time to Trump's rally or other alternative event? * Does the Equal Time Rule consider Trump's refusal to participate seen as "declining" the opportunity offered by the network/Commission and the town hall could be broadcast with Biden alone while not running afoul of the equal time rule? * What other possibilities exempt or bind broadcasters to the Equal Time Rule?

2020 US Vice Presidential Debate Real Time Fact Checking THE DEBATE IS NOW OVER, PLEASE USE THIS [MEGATHREAD TO DISCUSS THE DEBATE](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/j753rn/megathread_discuss_the_2020_vice_presidential/?)  ---  As we did with the[ first Presidential debate](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/j29i27/2020_first_us_presidential_debate_real_time_fact/), the r/NeutralPolitics moderation team has decided to host a live fact-checking megathread for the 2020 US Vice Presidential debate, which begins today (October 7th, 2020) at 9 pm EST.  Streams of the debate can be found at :  [PBS/Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4WJhh-XgQ0&feature=emb_title)  [CSPAN/Youtube](https://www.c-span.org/debates/)  The way this will work is as follows:  ***MODERATORS WILL POST FACTUAL CLAIMS AS TOP LEVEL COMMENTS***  Each top level comment will contain a significant factual claim from one of the candidates. Moderators will be transcribing live, so we ask for patience as we will do our best to capture as many substantial, relevant and verifiable claims as we can. AutoMod will remove all top level comments not by mods.  ***USER REPLIES TO TOP LEVEL COMMENTS***  Users (you) can reply to the stated claims by laying out the related facts and [linking to qualified sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_sources), but **we discourage those replies from judging the veracity of the claim**. Leave that determination to the readers.  So, instead of stating whether a claim is "true" or "false," a good a second level response would be something like, "Candidate A seems to be referring to this study [source], which has been called into question by some experts [source]."  *Second level comments without links will be summarily removed.*  ***DISCUSSION BETWEEN USERS***  Users can then reply to each other in third-level comments and below.  ---  Please remember that /r/NeutralPolitics rules still apply and all participants should adhere to the standards you have asked us to enforce. No matter the comment level, replies must be courteous, substantive, and supported by evidence.  The thread is default sorted by "new" and you may want to use an auto-refresh extension for your browser to keep up.  [Integrating the feedback from last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/j2ygru/meta_feedback_on_presidential_debate_fact/), the mods will try to provide more context where necessary and we'll post a separate discussion thread immediately after the debate is over.  Thanks for participating.
Illness and quorum in the Senate Specifically regarding quorum requirements for supreme court confirmation, what are the written laws requiring certain processes and what are the norms regarding attendance.    Since Ron Johnson's announcement [about attending the vote while Covid positive](https://www.nationalreview.com/news/sen-ron-johnson-says-he-will-vote-in-person-on-barrett-nomination-despite-testing-positive-for-coronavirus/), I was wondering about the details of this particular voting process. Since the only info I know, at the moment, is that [votes must be cast in person](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/493994-mcconnell-blocks-pauls-proposal-on-emergency-remote-voting) and that [a simply majority](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_option) is needed for confirmation (with VP as tie breaker).    Are there more elements to this process that I am unaware of? Thanks.
What happens in the presidential election if both major parties' candidates pass away or become incapacitated? [So Trump has tested positive for COVID-19](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/10/02/trump-melania-test-positive-coronavirus/5891100002/).  Of course, he may survive, but he may not. [Biden was just in a room with him for quite some time](https://in.reuters.com/video/watch/idOVCXVYAJJ), both talking very loudly. Biden could very well not have it, but he may. The chance is still very small, but there's now the possibility of them *both* passing away before the election has increased quite a bit.  So what are the likely changes in the election as a result of both major candidates passing away / being incapacitated?  I see some possibilities:  - The parties could have snap primaries to determine their candidates - The parties could select the second-place winner of their primary - The DNC & RNC could just pick new candidates as they see fit - The parties could just run the Vice Presidential candidates as Presidential ones - The election could be delayed (especially since it's this close to voting day, I imagine lots of voting materials & machines have been made with these candidates) - Some combination of the above  Which of these are possible / likely? Are there any rules governing this situation, or would it be a real fly-by-the-seat-of-our-pants thing?  Is there any precedence for this happening in prior elections?
How have diagnosed illnesses of elected US federal officials historically affected their favorability or election results? Last night, the president of the United States tweeted that [they had tested positive for COVID-19](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-trump-idUSKBN26N0K4) during the current pandemic, just about one month before the next US General Election for this and other federal elected positions.  A prior president who became ill at the time of a pandemic was Woodrow Wilson who [became ill in 1918 at the time of Spanish Flu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson) while in the middle of a 4 year term, became incapacitated by late 1919, and then in 1920 became unable to secure even a preliminary formal nomination [in their political party's Primary Election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1920_Democratic_National_Convention) before a General Election between the different parties.  The timing and severity of illnesses between the two presidents, given the limited information we have about the current presidential illness, appear to be vastly different at the present time.  Also, historical information I could find about Wilson's favorability appears limited [scholar survey results from 1948](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_rankings_of_presidents_of_the_United_States#Scholar_survey_results).  Those appear to not very representative of his favorability of citizens as scholars have generally ranked Wilson as one of the better U.S. presidents [\[source\]](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/30/arts/woodrow-wilsons-legacy-gets-complicated.html) [for his progressive policies](https://historynewsnetwork.org/article/160135) despite receiving strong criticism for being a supporter of racial segregation and white supremacy .[\[source\]](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/22/books/review/patricia-otoole-moralist-woodrow-wilson-biography.html)  Here are my discussion questions regarding elected US federal officials, especially presidents:  * What is the evidence of a tipping point for illness severity resulting in decreased voter support at the ballot box? * Has there been evidence of a tipping point for illness severity yielding increased favorability (e.g. sympathy vote)? * With those tipping points in mind, historically how have diagnosis of illnesses of officials affected their favorability? * Has another official ever become ill from something, and their related stated policy positions were more lenient on means of illness mitigation compared to the other political parties' positions?  If so, how has this affected favorability or voting?
Does gerrymandering cause an increase in political polarization or unfair representation in legislative bodies? I ask this because the mods and users of r/neutralpolitics have always been a haven of mostly reasonable individuals that can give straight answers and cut through the politics and spin, directly to the facts.   For quite some time now, the conventional wisdom is that gerrymandering creates an unfair election system and is partly responsible for the increasing political polarization we’ve seen in America today.   https://campaignlegal.org/sites/default/files/CLC_PartisanGerrymandering_Report_FINAL.pdf    > *”Contributing to this environment of hyper-partisanship is the practice of partisan gerrymandering, which has been allowed to run rampant nationwide. Partisan gerrymandering creates an unrepresentative and unfair democracy and encourages self-interested politics.”*   But after doing some further research it seems that there isn’t nearly as much hard evidence for it as some news sources would claim.    https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/697120    > “*We find that redistrictors marginally help sustain the electoral security of incumbents. Yet counter to expectations, we find that independent redistrictors produce virtually the same degree of insulation as plans devised in legislatures or by politician commissions. Overall, our results suggest caution in overhauling state redistricting institutions as a mechanism to increase electoral competition; independent commissions may not be as politically neutral as theorized.”*  https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00393.x?casa_token=szE8E571AZYAAAAA%3ASnOYHpovXvF_ZI32PR4IBYySxTRl1C6MMKBU83TGATpmZv1ikHaV6HmWepzkT4GFW0HSq3qlxy6XcsQ    > *”We assess whether there is a strong causal relationship between congressional districting and polarization. We find very little evidence for such a link. First, we show that congressional polarization is primarily a function of the differences in how Democrats and Republicans represent the same districts rather than a function of which districts each party represents or the distribution of constituency preferences. Second, we conduct simulations to gauge the level of polarization under various “neutral” districting procedures. We find that the actual levels of polarization are not much higher than those produced by the simulations. We do find that gerrymandering has increased the Republican seat share in the House; however, this increase is not an important source of polarization.”*  https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ps-political-science-and-politics/article/gerrymanderers-are-coming-legislative-redistricting-wont-affect-competition-or-polarization-much-no-matter-who-does-it/89F49B2029DBE6A8F755B06B909454F1    > *”Our analysis of evidence from state legislatures during the last decade suggests that the effects of partisan redistricting on competition and polarization are small, considerably more nuanced than reformers would suggest, and overwhelmed by other aspects of the political environment.”*   https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0261379416303201    > *”The analysis reveals that while Republican and Democratic gerrymandering affects the partisan outcomes of Congressional elections in some states, the net effect across the states is modest, creating no more than one new Republican seat in Congress. Therefore, the partisan composition of Congress can mostly be explained by non-partisan districting, suggesting that much of the electoral bias in Congressional elections is caused by factors other than partisan intent in the districting process”*  From the studies that I could find, and the ones that weren’t locked behind the walls, the evidence is either nonexistent or very moderate in terms of any affect gerrymandering has, not only on political representation, but in fair voting districts itself.   Though I did find one study that did find some evidence that appointing a relatively nonpartisan arbiter in the drawing of legislative districts *did* increase competitiveness.   https://heinonline.org/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/vllalr54&amp;amp;amp;amp;section=9   > *”Contrary to the initial expectations of the authors, the evidence reviewed here suggests that politically independent redistricting seems to reduce partisanship in the voting behavior of congressional delegations from affected states in statistically significant ways. The authors conclude with notes about the study's implications for further research into redistricting and partisanship.”*   Am I missing something here?  What kind of effect do we know gerrymandering has on the make up of our legislative bodies and on political polarization?
What implementation options does Biden have to fulfill his proposed climate plan? Candidate Biden has his proposed plan for addressing climate change posted on his [campaign website.](https://joebiden.com/climate-plan/#)  The plan includes a number of common administrative steps like raising fuel standards, encouraging energy efficiency, and spending money on infrastructure, as well as more novel ideas including plans to encourage innovation in clean energy technologies through the creation of an ARPA style agency focused on climate change sources.  One notable proposal is the following:  > Establish an enforcement mechanism to achieve net-zero emissions no later than 2050, including a target no later than the end of President Biden’s first term in 2025 to ensure we get to the finish line. This enforcement mechanism will be based on the principles that polluters must bear the full cost of the carbon pollution they are emitting and that our economy must achieve ambitious reductions in emissions economy-wide instead of having just a few sectors carry the burden of change. The enforcement mechanism will achieve clear, legally-binding emissions reductions with environmental integrity.     What types of enforcement strategies are available options for a Biden administration to pursue?  Additionally, it is sometimes [claimed](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/us/politics/biden-climate-plan.html) that progressives are skeptical or unimpressed with Bidens proposals for not being ambitious enough. What are the differences between Biden's plan and the policies which progressives would like to see implemented?
[META] Feedback on Presidential debate fact checking thread Last night's live [debate fact-checking post](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/j29i27/2020_first_us_presidential_debate_real_time_fact/) easily achieved every goal that /r/NeutralPolitics thrives for (and more)! It took a lot of moderating strength and resources to make it even happen in the first place, but it did, and we never would have expected it to be such a resounding success. And for us, the main reason why it went so smoothly was because of you! Yes, **you**! The mod team wants to extend our gratitude for posting countless high-quality comments and discussions throughout the entire debate that abided by our stricter-than-usual rules, which really shines a light on what makes this subreddit so special.  Now, we're reaching out to you to discuss the fact-checking post  * What did you think of the live fact-checking initiative? Was it a useful tool to help you through the debate?  * And what about possible changes? Were the rules too limiting, or did they work as intended? * And of course, the most important question: should we do this again in the future? Did the value of the live fact-checking outweigh the moderating resources it took to run successfully?   -Thank you, the /r/NeutralPolitics mod team!
2020 First US Presidential Debate Real Time Fact Checking Thread FINAL EDIT : The debate is now concluded, but this post can be a valuable resource for those watching afterwards. Sort by "old" and scroll through while watching to get fact checking as you go.  ___    As [announced yesterday,](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/j1if9f/2020_us_presidential_debate_real_time/) the r/NeutralPolitics moderation team has decided to host a live fact-checking megathread for the first 2020 US Presidential debate,  which begins today (Sept 29th 2020) at 9 pm EST.

2020 US Presidential Debate Real Time Fact-Checking Initiative EDIT : The [debate thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/j29i27/2020_first_us_presidential_debate_real_time_fact/) is now up and will become available once the debate begins at 9pm EST.  ___   As in 2016, the moderation team has decided to post a live fact-checking megathread for at least the first 2020 Presidential debate. After which, we will discuss how it went and reassess its usefulness.   The way it will work is as follows:  * All top level comments will be posted by mods. **Automod will remove all top level comments not by mods**  Top level comments will contain a quote from one or both candidates transcribed by one of us while watching the debate. Obviously this will be live so there may be errors. But to avoid duplications, this will be done only by the mod team.  * Users can reply to mod comments with a fact check of the candidate statement.  All fact checks must contain a supporting, qualified source and must also clearly explain why it contradicts or confirms a candidate's claim. Replies to top level comments without a link will be summarily removed.  * Users can then reply to each other in third-level and above comments  Therefore, the NP mod team will not be doing the fact checking, but we are rather providing a forum for our users to fact check. The only thing we're doing in an "official" capacity is transcribing the candidate statements. We report; you fact check.  Normal NeutralPolitics rules will still apply including rules on [qualified sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_sources).

Given the trend we've seen in the past 12 elections, what factors contribute to the importance of Pennsylvania, Florida, Wisconsin and Michigan in US Presidential elections? [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/2020-election-trump-pennsylvania-michigan-wisconsin-florida-a9091716.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/2020-election-trump-pennsylvania-michigan-wisconsin-florida-a9091716.html)  Aside  from the George W Bush elections in 2000 and 2004 (where of these 4  only Florida went for the Republicans), every election since 1972 has at  least a 3/4 majority of these 4 states picking the candidate that was  the eventual winner of the Presidency:  1972: 4/4  1976: 3/4  1980: 4/4  1984: 4/4  1988: 3/4  1992: 3/4  1996: 4/4  2000:1/4  2004: 1/4  2008: 4/4  2012: 4/4  2016: 4/4  (Source: [https://www.270towin.com/historical-presidential-elections/timeline/](https://www.270towin.com/historical-presidential-elections/timeline/))
What are the legal and political implications of a US presidential campaign's reported plan to have state legislatures override apparent election results? Barton Gellman describes in *The Atlantic* a post–Election Day contingency plan by one of the US presidential campaigns:  > According to sources in the [candidate's] Party at the state and national levels, the [candidate's] campaign is discussing contingency plans to bypass election results and appoint loyal electors in battleground states where [candidate's party] hold the legislative majority. With a justification based on claims of rampant fraud, [candidate] would ask state legislators to set aside the popular vote and exercise their power to choose a slate of electors directly. The longer [candidate] succeeds in keeping the vote count in doubt, the more pressure legislators will feel to act before the safe-harbor deadline expires.  > ...  > The [candidate's] campaign legal adviser I spoke with told me the push to appoint electors would be framed in terms of protecting the people’s will. Once committed to the position that the overtime count has been rigged, the adviser said, state lawmakers will want to judge for themselves what the voters intended.  > “The state legislatures will say, ‘All right, we’ve been given this constitutional power. We don’t think the results of our own state are accurate, so here’s our slate of electors that we think properly reflect the results of our state,’ ” the adviser said.  (For neutral discussion purposes I've removed the identity of the candidate, since the plan seems equally possible for both the incumbent and the challenger, but you can see it in [the article](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/11/what-if-trump-refuses-concede/616424/).)  What are the legal arguments and counterarguments for this option under the federal constitution and statutes? Are there relevant state laws that vary from one state to another?  And on the political side, have leaders from either side spoken on the record about their approval or disapproval of this possibility?
How does the jurisprudence of Judge Amy Coney Barrett compare to and contrast with the jurisprudence of 21st Century SCOTUS members?

What reforms have been proposed to alter the United States Federal Court system? Is there evidence to suggest that these reforms can achieve their desired outcomes? Just hours after the passing of [Justice Ginsberg](https://www.npr.org/2020/09/18/100306972/justice-ruth-bader-ginsburg-champion-of-gender-equality-dies-at-87), Majority Leader McConnell indicated that should the President put forward a [nominee,](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/media/president-trump-releases-list-of-prospective-supreme-court-nominees-biden-must-do-the-same/) that individual would ["receive a vote on the floor of the United States Senate"](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mcconnell-trump-supreme-court-nominee-senate-ruth-bader-ginsburg/). This [reversal](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mitch-mcconnell-supreme-court-vacancy-election-year-senate/) of stated position has [led](https://www.newsweek.com/gop-supreme-court-eric-holder-1533125) to [suggestions](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/09/democrats-really-might-try-to-pack-the-courts/) that should the Democrats win both the Presidency and flip the Senate, they should move to [expand the number of Justices in the Supreme Court](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/09/19/mcconnell-biden-pack-court/).   However, expanding/contracting the number of Supreme Court Justices has happened in the past, as the [SCOTUS](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) has had as many as [10 but as few as 5 Justices](https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/faq_general.aspx), with the [Judiciary Act of 1869](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary_Act_of_1869) settling the number at it's current 9. That led me to wonder what other reforms have been proposed. For example, Supreme Court Justice [term limits](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-08-09/18-is-enough-limit-the-terms-of-supreme-court-justices) have been proposed, an idea that [Justice Breyer](https://www.c-span.org/video/?459962-1/justice-breyer-discusses-life-supreme-court&start=491) considers fine.   * Beyond term limits, what other US Federal Court reforms have been proposed? Is there evidence to suggest these reforms can achieve their desired outcomes?  * How could such reforms be achieved? Would the process differ for reforming lower courts compared to the Supreme Court?  * Are there any analogous situations that occurred in Federal court systems outside of the United States? If so, what was the result of these reforms?
What are the precedents and relevant parties' incentives surrounding the replacement of Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court? Last night, Supreme Court of the United States Justice [Ruth Bader Ginsburg passed away](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/09/18/ruth-bader-ginsburg-supreme-court/545704001/) after a long struggle with cancer.  Ginsburg was a [generally liberal vote](https://www.axios.com/supreme-court-justices-ideology-52ed3cad-fcff-4467-a336-8bec2e6e36d4.html) on the court, and had a long career before joining the bench as a [pioneering advocate for women's rights.](https://www.aclu.org/other/tribute-legacy-ruth-bader-ginsburg-and-wrp-staff)  Shortly before she passed away, she dictated [a statement](https://www.npr.org/2020/09/18/100306972/justice-ruth-bader-ginsburg-champion-of-gender-equality-dies-at-87) that "My most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed."  Contrary to Justice Ginsburg's wish, President Trump and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell have indicated an intent to go forward with a nomination to replace Justice Ginsburg.  McConnell released [a statement](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/18/us/mitch-mcconnell-rbg-trump.html?action=click&module=Spotlight&pgtype=Homepage) last night saying "President Trump’s nominee will receive a vote on the floor of the United States Senate."  This morning [on Twitter,](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1307321159113936896?s=19) President Trump said  >".@GOP   We were put in this position of power and importance to make decisions for the people who so proudly elected us, the most important of which has long been considered to be the selection of United States Supreme Court Justices. We have this obligation, without delay!"  Significant public attention has been brought to [the comparison](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/09/19/what-mcconnell-said-merrick-garland-vs-after-ginsburgs-death/5837543002/) of the death of Justice Scalia in early 2016, when McConnell refused to allow hearings or a vote on President Obama's nominee Merrick Garland.  Ultimately, Garland's nomination was not considered and after President Trump was elected, it was withdrawn and [Neil Gorsuch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Gorsuch_Supreme_Court_nomination) was nominated and ultimately filled the seat previously held by Justice Scalia.  In response to the stated intentions of Republican leaders to fill Justice Ginsburg's seat, some prominent Democrats such as [Sen. Ed Markey](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/517191-dem-senator-calls-for-eliminating-filibuster-expanding-supreme-court-if-gop) have called for Congress to expand the court if they gain power in the 2020 elections to counteract the move.  So my questions are:  1.  What are the precedents for filling a vacancy so close to an election?  Besides the notable Garland precedent, are there any others?  2. What incentives do Republicans in tough re-election fights have prior to the election, or during the [lame duck](https://www.senate.gov/reference/glossary_term/lame_duck_session.htm) period?  3.  Has any lame duck Congress moved on something as controversial/high profile as this after a change in party power?  4. If Ginsburg is replaced prior to Jan 2021, and Democrats win power in the election, what are their incentives as far as possible responses?  Is there a history of court packing threats being effective?   ---  Mod footnote  This submission is being made on behalf of the mod team due to high interest in this general question and the desire to have a post up that meets our standards on it relatively quickly.

Why were Howard, Gallaudet, and other HBCUs given specific funding in the COVID-19 Stimulus Bill? This was something that blew up temporarily in late March. At the time, it was a hot issue and I'm hoping that 6 months of distance can provide an answer.   When the Coronavirus Relief Bill was passed, Representative Matt Gaetz tweeted out that Howard University was singled out to receive funding in the bill. There was an uproar in response to Gaetz's tweet, with many people on Reddit and other social media questioning Gaetz's motives in singling out Howard. It is true that Gallaudet also received specific funding from the bill and Gaetz did not immediately identify that school.  Here is Gaetz's initial tweet: [https://twitter.com/RepMattGaetz/status/1242887266718097410](https://twitter.com/RepMattGaetz/status/1242887266718097410)  Here is a copy of the bill. [https://apps.npr.org/documents/document.html?id=6819239-FINAL-FINAL-CARES-ACT](https://apps.npr.org/documents/document.html?id=6819239-FINAL-FINAL-CARES-ACT)  See page 768 for the mention of specific funding directed to Howard University, 767 for specific funding directed to Gallaudet, and page 331 for specific mention of loan deferments to HBCUs (Historically Black Colleges and Universities).  Many of the criticisms of Gaetz's tweet replied that Howard University was the home of Howard University Hospital, a COVID response center for D.C. Here is one example: [https://twitter.com/BenJealous/status/1243050384479924224](https://twitter.com/BenJealous/status/1243050384479924224)  Others echoing the same sentiment can be found in the top-voted comments on the response post to Gaetz's tweet in the most popular political subreddit. (not sure if I can link a Reddit thread as a source).  However, Howard University Hospital has been managed by Adventist Healthcare since February [https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/adventist-signs-deal-to-take-over-management-of-howard-university-hospital/2020/02/06/06e26ec8-4928-11ea-bdbf-1dfb23249293\_story.html](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/adventist-signs-deal-to-take-over-management-of-howard-university-hospital/2020/02/06/06e26ec8-4928-11ea-bdbf-1dfb23249293_story.html)   The bill's language also makes no reference to the money being related to the hospital but rather to   >prevent, prepare for, and respond to coronavirus, domestically or internationally, including to help defray the expenses directly caused by coronavirus and to enable grants to students for expenses directly related to 3 coronavirus and the disruption of university operations.  I can't see what connection any of that has to the hospital. Similarly, Gallaudet has no major hospital service.  Other commenters and articles noted that Howard and Gallaudet were unique in that they were chartered directly by Congress and therefore do not receive federal funds in the same way. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/rep-matt-gaetz-questions-emergency-funding-for-howard-university/2020/03/26/7017d5f2-6fa9-11ea-b148-e4ce3fbd85b5\_story.html](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/rep-matt-gaetz-questions-emergency-funding-for-howard-university/2020/03/26/7017d5f2-6fa9-11ea-b148-e4ce3fbd85b5_story.html)  However, that also seems to be incorrect. American, Georgetown, and George Washington University were also chartered by congress and did not get special mention in the bill. And two of those universities also have hospitals (although not ones designated as COVID response centers). [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University\_charter#Federal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_charter#Federal)  I know that nearly 70% of Gallaudet's budget comes almost entirely from federal funds: [https://www2.ed.gov/about/overview/budget/budget16/justifications/m-gallaudet.pdf](https://www2.ed.gov/about/overview/budget/budget16/justifications/m-gallaudet.pdf)  Howard's budget, however, is only 30% from federal funds. [https://www2.ed.gov/about/overview/budget/budget19/justifications/s-howard.pdf](https://www2.ed.gov/about/overview/budget/budget19/justifications/s-howard.pdf)  On top of that, Good Jobs First's stimulus tracker shows that Howard received roughly the same amount of money as GW and a bit more than Georgetown, while all three received far more than Gallaudet.  [https://data.covidstimuluswatch.org/prog.php](https://data.covidstimuluswatch.org/prog.php)  But I'm having a difficult time figuring out what money they are referring to in here because there seem to be multiple sources of funding.  With all of that in mind, what is the justification for singling out Howard, Gallaudet, and HBCUs in the stimulus bill? Is Gaetz correct to question the singling out of specific institutions for money or is there a justification for it that is not completely clear?
How much money can an individual contribute to a presidential election campaign? News has recently come out that [Mike Bloomberg will spend at least $100 million in Florida alone. ](https://www-washingtonpost-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.washingtonpost.com/politics/bloomberg-money-florida-biden/2020/09/12/af51bb50-f511-11ea-bc45-e5d48ab44b9f_story.html?amp_js_v=a3&amp_gsa=1&outputType=amp&usqp=mq331AQFKAGwASA%3D#aoh=16001052892730&csi=1&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fpolitics%2Fbloomberg-money-florida-biden%2F2020%2F09%2F12%2Faf51bb50-f511-11ea-bc45-e5d48ab44b9f_story.html) to help Joe Biden win the state.  According to [this](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_finance_in_the_United_States#Federal_contribution_limits) an individual can give $2,800 to a candidate, $5,000 to a super PAC, $35,500 to the party, or $106,500 to some special accounts of the party.  Even if we added all of these up, it doesn't come close to a hundred million dollars.  What rules exist that allow this?  Can someone explain how this works?
Trump just got nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for his role in the Israel-UAE deal. What are the pros and cons of this deal, and how instrumental was Trump in achieving this? Donald Trump was just recently [nominated](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/09/norwegian-far-right-mp-nominates-donald-trump-for-nobel-peace-prize?fbclid=IwAR0-2vyzJLsq99zHVK4YuYcTSvWRVVZWi0Rz9GhnH03Jy52N2fMWfrww7lI) for a Nobel Peace Prize for his role in normalizing relations between [Israel and the UAE](https://apnews.com/bca7a9df17c8d39a682dc78211feaf60).

Was Trump a key negotiator, or were relations between the UAE and Israel already on their way to being normalized when Trump entered the White House?
Joe Biden says he will stop the governments use of private prisons. What mechanisms and tools can the Biden administration use to accomplish this? What mechanisms and strategies can the private prison industry use to circumvent his proposed policies/policy changes? Joe Biden says he will stop the federal governments use of private prisons and discourage state use of private prisons and "all other methods of profiteering off of incarceration" [link](https://joebiden.com/justice/#). According to his website, " he will make clear that the federal government should not use private facilities for any detention, including detention of undocumented immigrants" and he will require local and state recipients of federal grant money for prevention programs to eliminate their use of private criminal justice facilities and programs [link](https://joebiden.com/justice/#). What mechanisms can Biden use to 'make this clear' in an enforceable way?  Considering the private prison industry was worth 5 billion two years ago [link](https://theweek.com/articles/788226/private-prison-industry-explained), corporations reliance on prison labor [link](https://www.peoplesworld.org/article/corporations-and-governments-collude-in-prison-slavery-racket/) costing as little as $0.23/hour in federal facilities [link](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/wage_policies.html), the great depth in which the private prison industry is tied to the financial industry (apparently if you have a 401k you most likely profit from the private prison industry) [link](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/mvpzkp/whos-getting-rich-off-the-prison-industrial-complex), how can Joe Biden actually follow through?  Much of our economy and politics is influenced by the private prison complex [link](https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/indus.php?ind=G7000). One of the largest companies in the private prison complex is the GEO Group [link](https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/indus.php?ind=G7000), which is a "publicly traded real estate investment trust" that invests in private prisons and mental healthcare facilities. It had a revenue of 2.477 billion USD in 2019 [link](http://investors.geogroup.com/Cache/IRCache/e8834b22-d61e-72a5-e092-5fdb26d2c9e4.PDF?O=PDF&T=&Y=&D=&FID=e8834b22-d61e-72a5-e092-5fdb26d2c9e4&iid=4144107) and is the 12th biggest political contributor in the "Misc. Business" Category (that include companies such as Walmart and Home Depot) on Open Secrets [link](https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/contrib.php?ind=N). Private prisons have built incentives to profit off of their detainees [link](https://www.sentencingproject.org/publications/capitalizing-on-mass-incarceration-u-s-growth-in-private-prisons/).  The private prison industry is not just real estate. Other industries invested in private criminal justice system programs include commercial bail programs (a $2 billion/year industry [link](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/14/who-makes-money-from-bail.html)), private diversion programs, electronic monitoring programs, private re-entry programs, private debt collection [link](https://www.nclc.org/images/pdf/criminal-justice/report-commercialized-injustice.pdf), private providers of medical services, private providers for food services, private providers for transportation [link](https://www.axios.com/profiting-prison-c2bd43b2-4b2f-44ee-8f23-c6c9a14c1aaa.html), and telecommunication systems that prisoners and their families have to pay exorbitant fees for [link](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/phones/). Biden's proposal to withhold federal grant money for state and local governments' prevention programs is not only dependent on their discontinued use of private facilities, but also their discontinued use of private diversion programs, commercial bail programs, and electronic monitoring programs [link](https://joebiden.com/justice/#). (He is separately supporting legislation to crack down on private telecommunications companies controlling inmate calls. It is not part of the federal grant money stipulations.)  If Biden's strategies are successful and unchallenged, federal, state, and local governments will all stop the use of private criminal justice system programs (as listed above). 44,000 thousand people are employed by private correctional facilities alone [link](https://www.ibisworld.com/united-states/market-research-reports/correctional-facilities-industry/). Common sense says these industries aren't going down without a fight. What mechanisms and strategies can both sides use to achieve their goals?
What objective evidence is there of Trump and Biden's religiosity? Religiosity - [the quality or state of being religious; religious feeling or devotion](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/religiosity) - has been a Big Deal in American elections since Washington's "[fervent supplications to that Almighty Being who rules over the Universe](https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/american_originals/inaugtxt.html)", e.g.,  * [JFK's bid for president was famously nearly derailed by his Catholicism](https://www.wbur.org/news/2017/05/25/kennedy-catholicism-presidential-campaign) * Similarly, Romney's Mormonism was [an issue in the 2008 election](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/22/weekinreview/22luo.html) * [Only one member of the House and Senate, Senator Kyrsten Sinema, claims to be nonreligious and no member describes themselves as an atheist](https://theconversation.com/how-strong-a-role-does-religion-play-in-us-elections-133224) * [In the 2012 election, white Americans who seldom or never attend religious services (42% of all whites) gave Democrat Barack Obama 58% of their votes; by contrast, whites who attend religious services once a week or more (33% of all whites) voted 73% for Republican John McCain](https://www.ispionline.it/it/pubblicazione/religion-and-2012-american-presidential-election-4989)  &nbsp;  Of course, we can't know any candidates thoughts; after all, "[*For what man knows the things of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him*](https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-11.htm)?". And it's hard to take a candidate at their word alone - "lying politician" is almost a proverb - so a candidate's *statements* about religiosity are not really informative.  Still, one would expect deeply held beliefs to affect action in an objective way. Perhaps a candidate spends every Sunday or no Sunday in church? Perhaps a candidate TA'd theology class in grad school?   &nbsp;  **What** ***objective*** **evidence is there of Trump and Biden's religiosity?**

Some States have early voting and/or vote by mail. The Presidency will be contested, along with all 435 seats in the House of Representatives, 35 of the 100 seats in the Senate, 13 State and territorial governorships, as well as numerous other state and local offices and ballot measures.  If you are a U.S. citizen who will be at least 18 years old on election day, you're [probably eligible to vote,](https://www.usa.gov/who-can-vote) but many States require advanced registration.

U.S. had federally deputized Oregon state police which can circumvent state/local prosecution - What are the precedent and implications? >**Oregon State Police (OSP) troopers assigned to help the Portland Police Bureau with its response to the city's nightly protests have been cross-deputized by the federal government.**   >   >The move actually happened earlier this summer, when state troopers were brought in to help facilitate the departure of federal officers from downtown Portland. ([Source](https://www.kgw.com/article/news/local/protests/oregon-state-police-troopers-deputized-by-federal-government/283-37a20404-cb6e-4502-9dde-441bff3347a9))  Cross-deputized means that police can cross jurisdictions, or in this context the arrests that they make are formally subject to not just state/local laws but also federal law.  This is meaningful because...  >The Multnomah County District Attorney Mike Schmidt previously announced [his office would presumptively decline to prosecute certain misdemeanor charges](https://www.koin.com/news/protests/multco-da-mike-schmidt-to-announce-new-protest-policy/) stemming from the protests ([Source](https://www.koin.com/news/protests/oregon-state-police-troopers-federally-deputized-amid-renewed-portland-protest-response/))  So the cross-deputization of OSP troopers can allow state police to bypass the local District Attorney's Office entirely when it comes to charges against arrested protesters.  In fact, **arrests made by OSP troopers assigned to Portland are now being reviewed by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for potential federal prosecution.** (Source #2)  The governor's office claims "the U.S. Attorney and Multnomah County District Attorney's Office work together each day to decide which protest arrest cases will be prosecuted", but there has been [prior contention with between OSP and the DA](https://www.koin.com/news/protests/multco-sheriff-to-da-dont-dismiss-riot-charges/) and local vs federal contentions required negotiations between the state governor and US Vice President. (Source #2)  My questions for the sub:  * What is the prior precedent/occurrences of the US federal government charging or review previously arrested people with crimes that a state/local government attorney has expressed they will not prosecute? * Can the US government's means of cross-deputizing and prosecution be used in a way that violates state sovereignty as defined in the constitution, notably [the 10th Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution)?  >The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.  * Were any comparable cross-deputizing actions taken during any prior wars, such as the Civil War? * Aside from the actions explained here or the Insurrection Act, are there any other laws or charges that federal government could leverage if they wanted to compel a local prosecutor or governor to take further action in increasing law enforcement efforts or prosecuting citizens? * Aside from a lawsuit on 10th amendment grounds, are there other remedies that local prosecutors/governors/officials have that can stop the federal government from either compelling them to take action OR circumventing local intent to not take certain actions (prosecution, enforcement, etc)?
What are the benefits and limitations of Tricameralism? What are the historical reasons why tricameralism fails to persist? Tricameralism is a system of governance that involves 3 separate legislative bodies/houses. This differs from the systems most modern, western democracies use, being bicameralism (having two legislative houses, such as in the case of the US) and unicameralism (having one house, such as in the case of New Zealand). Tricameral systems are fairly rare but they have happened, though most have ended up becoming bicameral and unicameral at some point. Why is this? Beyond that, what are the pros and cons of a tricameral system?  Bicameral and Unicameral Legislatures: [https://www.britannica.com/topic/constitutional-law/Unicameral-and-bicameral-legislatures](https://www.britannica.com/topic/constitutional-law/Unicameral-and-bicameral-legislatures)  Tricameralism: [https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Tricameralism](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Tricameralism)
What are the legal implications of the Republican National Convention? Last week the US Republican Party held its [presidential nominating convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Republican_National_Convention) in a variety of venues connected electronically, due to the surge of the COVID-19 pandemic in that country. The new format of the convention programming led to several questions about the legality of some segments:  * **Government-employed speakers:** Several employees of the federal civil service [spoke at the convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Republican_National_Convention#Washington,_D.C.:_August_24%E2%80%9327). However, the [Hatch Act of 1939](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatch_Act_of_1939) prohibits some executive-branch employees from some forms of partisan political activity, [raising concerns about the legality of the convention](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/08/05/899336580/biden-plans-to-accept-democratic-nomination-remotely). How is the Hatch Act enforced and what are the possible penalties for a violation? Did any of these civil servants or their staffs potentially break the law by participating in a party convention and (in most cases) endorsing a candidate?   * **Military personnel:** [The West Wing Sentries of the Marine Corps](https://americanmilitarynews.com/2016/03/a-look-at-the-elite-marines-that-stand-sentry-outside-the-west-wing/) provide security in the White House, where [several segments of the Republican convention were held](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Republican_National_Convention#Washington,_D.C.:_August_24%E2%80%9327). Are military personnel subject to the Hatch Act or similar regulations, or are they exempt when following orders from a superior such as the Commander in Chief?  * **Government-operated venues:** Is there any statute or regulation prohibiting the use of government facilities like the White House for partisan political events, or is it another potential violation of the Hatch Act by any individual government staff member who helped operate the venues or provided security?  * **Song usage:** Two performances of the Canadian singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen's song "Hallelujah" were included in the convention programming, but Cohen's estate [objects to the use of his song at this event](https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/9441926/leonard-cohen-estate-rnc-unauthorized-use-hallelujah). What are the legal rights of a composer, or his estate, regarding the use of his song at political events?  * **The Acting Secretary:** In a [naturalization ceremony](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/26/us/politics/trump-naturalization-ceremony-rnc.html) broadcast as part of the Republican convention, Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf administered the Oath of Allegiance to five prospective citizens. Under US Citizenship and Immigration Services [policy](https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-12-part-j-chapter-2), the Oath may be administered by specified officials and immigration judges as well as the Secretary himself. However, the Government Accountability Office [reported](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/14/gao-chad-wolf-ken-cuccinelli-ineligible-dhs-395222) two weeks earlier that Wolf's vacancy appointment was invalid and he is legally ineligible to hold his interim title. If Wolf's status as Acting Secretary was invalid when he administered the Oath of Allegiance, does it follow that the citizenship of the five people he swore in is also invalid?
Does the Supreme Court have the authority to Block the House from Electing a President if No Candidate Reaches 270? Given all the recent [hubbub](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/22/democrats-postal-service-rescue-400188) regarding voting for the election in November, does the Supreme Court have the authority to block the House from electing a President if States fail to certify their elections?  According to the [12th Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelfth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution), the House of Representatives is required to go into session immediately after the counting of the electoral votes to vote for president if no candidate for the office receives a majority of the electoral votes. If either candidate, or a State who had failed to certify their election results, sued, would the Supreme Court have the authority to delay or prohibit the House from electing a President? Is there precedent for the Supreme Court delaying or blocking Constitutional duties?

[18 U.S.C. 1701](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1701) makes it a criminal offense to "knowingly or willfully obstruct or retard the passage of U.S.Mail."

Can 18 U.S.C. chapter 83 be applied to the President's actions, generally, or is there any legal precedent of this chapter being applied to Presidential actions?
What are the pros and cons of a foreign policy that seeks to export and support liberal values internationally, via force if deemed necessary? In the time period from the fall of the Soviet Union until the election of Donald Trump, the US often attempted to enforce its liberal world view through foreign policy actions such as:  * [NATO expansion](https://www.brookings.edu/research/nato-enlargement-moving-forward-expanding-the-alliance-and-completing-europes-integration/) - After winning the Cold War, the US was compelled to expand NATO in order to remake eastern Europe into liberal democracies, utilizing the logic that [liberal democracies are less apt to wage war against each other.](https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199756223/obo-9780199756223-0014.xml)  * [The Bush Doctrine](https://www.jstor.org/stable/30035780?seq=1) - Defined as US military adventurism in the Middle East, during which proponents believed pre-emptive war would turn the Middle East into a sea of democracy, making it safe from WMD proliferation and terrorism.  * The Rise of China - During this time, the US practiced [engagement](https://www.ned.org/chinas-international-influence-on-democracy/) with China - inclusion into liberal international institutions like the WTO would foster economic interdependence, and once embedded into this system, would turn it into a liberal democracy and thus become a non-threatening nation-state.  What are the pros and cons of a foreign policy that seeks to export and support liberal values internationally, via force if deemed necessary?
Does the expected Clinesmith plea deal indicate that the Russia investigation started without proper evidence? Why or why not? As part the investigation led by John Durham, the U.S. attorney in Connecticut, former FBI lawyer Kevin Clinesmith is [expected to plead guilty](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kevin-clinesmith-fbi-lawyer-plead-guilty-probe-origins-russia-investigation/)  to altering an email that was used to apply for a FISA warrant to  surveil Carter Page, a Trump campaign advisor. The CIA had confirmed via  email that Page had been a source of theirs, but Clinesmith altered the  email, adding words to make it appear the CIA was saying Page was *not* a source.  The case stems from an overall [report by the Justice Department's Inspector General](https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/09/inspector-generals-report-russia-key-takeaways-079030)  into the origins of the FBI's investigation of possible ties between  the Trump campaign and Russian interference in the 2016 election. That  report found no evidence that political bias was a factor in opening the  investigation. However, Durham has publicly disagreed with some of the  report's conclusions and Clinesmith was previously faulted for sending  inappropriate texts, including "viva la resistance," a few weeks after  the 2016 election.  Does Kevin Clinesmith changing this e-mail compromise the validity of the Russia investigation or its origins? Why or why not?  Edit: Hopefully the edit won't violate any rules, the charging document shows Clinesmith altered the e-mail for application of the 3rd renewal of the application.  https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.221058/gov.uscourts.dcd.221058.1.0_2.pdf

Joe Biden's economic plan to improve Middle Class America touches on increasing minimum wage, creating more opportunities for worker representation with the PRO Act, and ending tipped minimum wage. How viable are these proposals and how to they compare to those attempted by past candidates? [Joe Biden's Plan](https://joebiden.com/build-back-better/)  The [Fair Labor Standards Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Labor_Standards_Act_of_1938) was passed in 1938 to set a federally-mandated minimum wage, among other goals. It has been amended many times to adjust the minimum wage for inflation, however no amendment has passed in the last 13 years to increase the minimum wage. [This Graph](https://poverty.ucdavis.edu/sites/main/files/imagecache/lightbox/main-images/min_wage_real_value_graph.jpg) shows how minimum wage has varied and compares it to the wage after adjusting for inflation (2012).  Biden's plan also mentions increasing tax rates on corporations and the wealthy. Effective tax rates on the wealthy have decreased since the 1940s, while the average American is paying roughly the same percentage as they did in the 1950s ([source](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/sites/default/files/styles/original_optimized/public/figure2_v3.png?itok=pUEyR9hR))  Worker representation decline: [In 2019, the percent of wage and salary workers who were members of unions--the union membership rate--was 10.3 percent, down by 0.2 percentage point from 2018, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. The number of wage and salary workers belonging to unions, at 14.6 million in 2019, was little changed from 2018. In 1983, the first year for which comparable union data are available, the union membership rate was 20.1 percent and there were 17.7 million union workers.](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/union2.nr0.htm)  What evidence supports claims that worker representation, tax rates on the wealthy, and minimum wage benefit middle class Americans?
Is there evidence that supports or rejects the idea that absentee voting is more secure than universal mail-in voting? Recently, President Trump has been [criticized by the media](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/08/13/trump-requests-mail-ballot-florida-primary-despite-rhetoric/3371605001/) for requesting an absentee ballot for Florida’s primary, amidst his attacks on mail-in voting.   White House Deputy Press Secretary, Judd Deere, confirmed this was true, and explained, [“The President supports absentee voting, not universal mail-in voting, which contain several safeguards that prevent fraud and abuse,".](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/amid-criticism-over-mail-voting-trump-requests-absentee-ballot-n1236714). When asked about it himself, President Trump summarized, [“Absentee good, universal mail-in very bad.”](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/amid-criticism-over-mail-voting-trump-requests-absentee-ballot-n1236714)  Earlier, on August 4th, President Trump expanded on this opinion: [“Whether you call it Vote by Mail or Absentee Voting, in Florida the election system is Safe and Secure, Tried and True. Florida’s Voting system has been cleaned up (we defeated Democrats attempts at change), so in Florida I encourage all to request a Ballot &amp; Vote by Mail! #MAGA”](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1290692768675901440?s=20)  Overall, President Trump supports the system of *requesting* absentee ballots, but is critical of states like New Jersey automatically [mailing ballots to “everybody”.](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/14/nj-sending-mail-in-ballots-statewide-in-2020-election-despite-trumps-attacks.html) Is there evidence that supports or rejects the idea that absentee voting is more secure than universal mail-in voting?
Natural Born Citizen Clause, and discussion revolving it. In a tweet in 2012, Donald Trump, now sitting President of the United States of America, has made a [tweet](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/203568571148800001) accusing the sitting president of that time, Barack Obama, of being born outside of the United States of America("Kenya").  In yesterday's news after Kamala Harris announced her run for Vice Presidency of America as Joe Biden's running mate, president Donald Trump [told reporters](https://www.npr.org/2020/08/13/902362014/trump-and-his-campaign-amplify-birther-conspiracy-against-kamala-harris) that he heard a "highly qualified, very talented lawyer" opine that Harris didn't qualify to serve as vice president, later telling the same reporter, as per in the [transcript](https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-task-force-press-conference-transcript-august-13) of the interview, "But that’s a very serious… You’re you’re saying that they’re saying that she doesn’t qualify because she wasn’t born in this country."  These statements/inquiries from Donald Trump, a then US private citizen, now the holder of the office of the President of the United States, seem to be made in reference to the following statement:  >No Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President;  The above statement, under Section 1 of Article Two of the [United States Constitution](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript), also known as the [Natural-born-citizen clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-born-citizen_clause#:~:text=Status%20as%20a%20natural%2Dborn,the%20nation%20from%20foreign%20influence.) sets forth the eligibility requirements for serving as president of the United States.  There are past president(s) who have been challenged of their eligibility to hold office because of this clause.  Barack Obama, for example, has released a copy of his [birth certificate](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/birth-certificate-long-form.pdf) to the public in rebuttal of accusations that he is not a natural-born citizen.   With that said:   * At which stage and to whom, is a president required to submit proof of natural-born citizenship, should they decide they want to be the president?   * There is no such requirement for taking office as the Vice President.  However, following the United States presidential line of succession, can a vice president who is not a natural-born citizen take office, in the case of if the president is not able to hold office in any capacity?   * Apart from Barack Obama, are there any other past presidents who have released proof(s) of their presidential election to be available to the public? Are there any precedence before him, if so, when was it set?  On the civilian side of this question:   * How is the public able to find out the eligibility of a presidential candidate, or an incumbent president, in terms of their status of natural-born citizenship?   * what is the procedure to remove a president who is not a natural born citizen, other than a congress impeachment and conviction?
What is the legality of two Presidential Campaigns coordinating in order to defeat a third? Recently it has come out that Kanye West has met with Jared Kusher "almost daily" [according to West.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/randalllane/2020/08/12/inside-kanye-wests-almost-daily-chats-with-jared-kushner-and-whether-the-white-house-exploits-his-mental-state/#117b79c53e16)  There are now allegations that the West campaign is solely meant as a spoiler campaign in order to assist in the election of President Trump.    If this were true, and both campaigns were coordinating, what is the legality of this under the FEC?
How can exit polling be done for mostly mail-in elections? If it can't, how else can results be independently verified? As discussed here [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election\_verification\_exit\_poll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_verification_exit_poll) exit polling has been used to reveal blatant election falsification before, though a central point of the article that I didn't realize when I started researching this is that traditional media exit polls aren't accurate enough to pick up more subtle issues and usually isn't done with that intent. Despite that, they were sufficient to detect falsification in the 2000 Serbian election. Specialized techniques (EVEP, which are the main focus of this article) are said to reduce margins of error, allowing exit polls to detect less blatant issues and making them stronger verifying tools.  As more and more elections are switching to mail-in because of the pandemic, how can exit polling be done for them? If it cannot be done, are there other ways to verify results? Some states like Washington have had mostly mail-in elections for a long time now. I tried to find info on how Washington's exit polls are done, but sadly I could not. Any info is greatly appreciated!  Other Links:  an example of a Washington state exit poll: [https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/primaries-caucuses/entrance-and-exit-polls/washington/democratic](https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/primaries-caucuses/entrance-and-exit-polls/washington/democratic)  Washington state elections history, showing when it started conducting mail-in elections: [https://www.sos.wa.gov/elections/timeline/time5.htm](https://www.sos.wa.gov/elections/timeline/time5.htm)  On voting by mail and the pandemic: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/politics/vote-by-mail-states/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/politics/vote-by-mail-states/)
What is the technical process if a person requests a mail in ballot, but then, due to doubts about the integrity of that process, decides to show up in person to vote? Like the title says. Alterations to existing mail delivery protocols have been made recently that will likely lead to reduced delivery capacity. Specifically the overtime cut detailed in the link below.   If the voter sent their ballot in by mail early, and, for whatever reason, decided they no longer trusted the integrity of that process resulting in them deciding to show up in person to vote, would they be liable for voting fraud, or is there already a process in place to ensure only one vote is counted?

What is the Constitutionality of the Executive Orders from the Trump Admin The President recently released 4 executive orders outlining   1. [An unemployment insurance increase of $400 for the remainder of 2020](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-authorizing-needs-assistance-program-major-disaster-declarations-related-coronavirus-disease-2019/)   2. [Deferring payroll tax obligations for the remainder of 2020](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-deferring-payroll-tax-obligations-light-ongoing-covid-19-disaster/)   3. [Stopping foreclosures for homeowners with federally backed mortgages for the remainder of 2020](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-fighting-spread-covid-19-providing-assistance-renters-homeowners/)   4. [Allowed deferment of student loan payments for the remainder of 2020 with no penalty](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-continued-student-loan-payment-relief-covid-19-pandemic/)   I'm curious about the legality of them as I'm having trouble understanding the process of reappropriating other funds for the unemployment insurance.  -Does the executive branch have the power to order government agencies to stop collecting taxes or payments?   -In the case of these EOs, does the executive branch have the ability to mandate that the states pick up the tab for part of it? If so, do mechanisms exist that allow States to avoid such a mandate?  -Do these EOs have any relation to natural disaster appropriations? If so, what is the nature of that relationship?  Edit: a typo
Does the President have the authority to ban apps like TikTok and WeChat? Earlier today, President Trump issued two executive orders banning transactions with Chinese-owned social media apps [TikTok](https://publicpool.kinja.com/subject-executive-order-on-addressing-the-threat-posed-1844641902) and [WeChat](https://publicpool.kinja.com/subject-executive-order-on-addressing-the-threat-posed-1844642059) in 45 days if they aren't sold to a U.S. company by that time. In the executive order, he cites the following as reasons why he can ban the apps:  >By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code . . .  However, a number of legal experts have contended that [he doesn't have the authority to ban such apps](https://www.businessinsider.com/can-trump-ban-tiktok-no-legal-experts-cfius-alternative-options-2020-7), while others have argued that [it's ambiguous](https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/donald-trump-ban-tiktok-1234722971/) or that [he does indeed have the authority](https://www.engadget.com/trumps-threat-to-ban-tik-tok-might-be-legal-but-its-super-shady-203026097.html). What laws or interpretations of the law are there that allow such executive orders to be issued, if any? Does such an act go beyond the president's authority?
Are there estimates on the impact of recent USPS changes on the delivery of mail in ballots? What powers do states and other localities have to aid the speed and reliability of ballot delivery? [As has been recently reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/us/politics/trump-usps-mail-delays.html) Louis DeJoy, the Trump administration's newly appointed postmaster general, has made changes to the USPS that have resulted in reports of delayed and less reliable mail delivery. This has caused concert from voting rights groups as 2020 is an election year where mail in voting is being heavily promoted due to the pandemic making in person voting a public health risk.  [As discussed elsewhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/i2xae6/what_are_the_arguments_for_and_against_the/) on [r/NeutralPolitics](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/), many states require mail in ballots to be received by election day ([Source](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2020/07/14/are-american-elections-pandemic-proof-a-state-by-state-scorecard/)) so significant delays could cause many otherwise valid votes to not be counted ([Source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/tens-of-thousands-of-mail-ballots-have-been-tossed-out-in-this-years-primaries-what-will-happen-in-november/2020/07/16/fa5d7e96-c527-11ea-b037-f9711f89ee46_story.html)).   Do we have expert estimates on how many votes might be affected? Or estimates on how long mail in ballots may be delayed?   What legal powers do states and cities have anything bolster mail service or otherwise make submitting mail in ballots easier? Is there any precedent for a city or state doing so?  Edit: One answer that I have found is that states can expand their [ballot drop box](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/more-states-are-using-ballot-drop-boxes-for-voters-who-dont-trust-the-mail-but-the-boxes-are-already-drawing-skepticism/2020/08/06/4165e7c4-d68a-11ea-930e-d88518c57dcc_story.html) availability which of course circumvents the USPS but has its own problems. I am still not really finding any empirical looks at the
Where can I find a list of legislation that has a reasonable probability of passing in the upcoming 4 years? According to [govtrack.us](https://govtrack.us), currently there are 14,263 bills and resolution currently before US congress. Many of these bills may not leave committee, be brought to a vote on the floor, or pass one or more branches of Congress. In other words, some bills have an extremely low probability of becoming enacted into law.  Govtrack also reports "prognosis" (the chance legislation might be enacted) of every bill, which provided by [Skopos Labs](https://www.skoposlabs.com/). However, I can't seem to figure out how to sort legislation by prognosis (I think I'm just bad at navigating the site?) Would anyone know any alternative resources where legislation can be found/sorted by prognosis or probability of passing?  I have a limited amount of time in my life, I'm not particularly interested in perusing every single bill that is currently in Congress. However, I would love to know which bills are hot under consideration and have a plausible probability of passing in the upcoming future. If anyone has an advice about how they go ahead filtering through the swamp of bills currently in Congress, I would appreciate hearing their methodology.  In summary, here are my questions:  (A) Where can I find resources listing legislation ordered/filtered by the probability they might be enacted?  (B) Is anyone aware of additional alternative third-party resources that also provide "prognosis" of bills, similar to Skopos Labs?
What are the arguments for and against the "postmark rule" regarding mail-in ballots? As the COVID-19 pandemic [shows no signs of slowing](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/coronavirus-threat-rises-across-us-we-just-have-to-assume-the-monster-is-everywhere/2020/08/01/cdb505e0-d1d8-11ea-8c55-61e7fa5e82ab_story.html) in the US, numerous states [have expanded access](https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/501577-heres-where-your-state-stands-on-mail-in-voting) to voting by mail rather than in person at polling places. However, a detail of the implementation is attracting its own controversy: [some states count only](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/preparing-your-state-election-under-pandemic-conditions#t4) mail-in ballots that are received by Election Day, while others count any ballots postmarked by Election Day (usually with some later receiving deadline). President Donald Trump argued [on Thursday](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-july-30-2020/) that delaying an official election result to count mail-in ballots undermines the legitimacy of that result, while others have [expressed concern](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/postal-service-backlog-sparks-worries-that-ballot-delivery-could-be-delayed-in-november/2020/07/30/cb19f1f4-d1d0-11ea-8d32-1ebf4e9d8e0d_story.html) that new delays at the US Postal Service could cause chaos in the nationwide elections.  What are the constitutional and practical arguments for and against the "postmark rule", i.e. that ballots postmarked by Election Day should be counted even if they are received on a later date? Are there any grounds to challenge the constitutionality of a state's rule on this matter? If so, who has legal standing to bring that suit and does it belong to state courts or federal courts?
In a US general election, what happens if not enough states have certified their results to determine a winner by the time the current presidential term ends? In the US, the Congress has [set the date of the general election](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/2/7) as the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. According to the [20th Amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxx) to the US Constitution, the new term begins roughly 11 weeks later:  > The terms of the President and Vice President shall end at noon on the 20th day of January...  That means the current presidential term ends on January 20, 2021.   This year, election officials are [expecting a significant increase in the use of mail-in ballots](https://www.nwpb.org/2020/05/04/ballot-printers-increase-capacity-to-prepare-for-mail-voting-surge/) for the [November 3rd election.](https://www.marieclaire.com/politics/a26251797/2020-election-voter-registration-deadlines/) Mail-in ballots [take much longer to count](https://fortune.com/2020/06/27/2020-election-results-mail-in-ballots-primary-general-november-presidential/) and their use has recently been correlated with [increased turnout.](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/501384-turnout-surges-after-states-expand-mail-in-voting)  Recent elections have also seen an [increase in recounts,](https://ballotpedia.org/Noteworthy_recounts_in_the_United_States) which take considerable time, and if there's a disputed result, that could extend the time to certification even more. The outcome of the [2000 presidential contest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_United_States_presidential_election) took nearly five weeks to resolve, and that was without an elevated number of mail-in ballots.  Experts are already warning people to [expect delays in reporting the results this year,](https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2020/be-patient-on-election-night-2020-counting-the-returns-will-take-time/) but the President [tweeted today:](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1288933078287745024)  > Must know Election results on the night of the Election, not days, months, or even years later!  There is a [statutory deadline](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/3/7) (December 14th this year) for the electors to cast their votes, but in a year like this one, it certainly seems possible that a Secretary or State or two would not feel comfortable enough with the count to certify the election by then.  So, in a case where we don't have enough certified election results to determine an [electoral college](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College) winner by the time the term ends, what happens? Does the current President remain in office until a winner is certified? Does the country run without a President until a winner is certified? Does someone else serve as interim president, perhaps determined by the order of succession? Does the Congress take action? Are there legal/Constitutional procedures outlined for such a case, or is this an unforeseen circumstance?
How do tax breaks for oil companies work, and what is their purpose? I've recently been thinking about corporate welfare, and wondering why it exists.  Probably the most well known example of corporate welfare is in tax breaks for oil companies.    You can find news about tax breaks for oil companies in many places, but here is the latest source I read:  https://www.mintpressnews.com/4-examples-of-corporate-welfare/167149/  Essentially, I want to know:  1.  __How do these tax breaks work?__   2.  __What is the official purpose of these tax breaks?__  I'm __not__ looking for speculation on any underlying motives of people who passed these tax codes.  That is easy enough to find with a google search.  I want to know what the official purpose is.
What are the legalities surrounding delaying the 2020 U.S. elections? President Trump has recently suggested that the 2020 elections [could be delayed](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-53597975) "until people could "properly, securely and safely" vote."  The BBC article states the the President does not have unilateral power to do so. If it is possible, what are the steps to do so? Is it even possible? Other U.S. elections for [the House, the Senate, Governers, and local elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_elections) are also to be held; if the 2020 election was to be delayed, would these be affected too? If so, how?  Are there any powers, legal or otherwise, for other parties to attempt to counteract/stop this decision?
What does the First Amendment protects, for social media platforms, and what does it not protect? In a tweet complaining about Twitter trends, Trump said that trends that are critical of him are illegal.  [Link to tweet](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1287880895051907072?s=20):  >So disgusting to watch Twitter’s so-called “Trending”, where sooo many trends are about me, and never a good one. They look for anything they can find, make it as bad as possible, and blow it up, trying to make it trend. Really ridiculous, illegal, and, of course, very unfair!  Broadly speaking, the [First Amendment](https://www.history.com/topics/united-states-constitution/first-amendment) protects the freedom of speech, religion and the press. However, there are some [permissible restrictions](https://www.britannica.com/topic/First-Amendment/Permissible-restrictions-on-expression). With that said:  * Can social media and their features that are a result of their user base's activity(such as twitter trends) be illegal? In twitter's case, what statutes have they violated?  * Can the president prevent phrases from trending on any social media that might be critical of the President or other elected officials?  * Similarly, what are the tools the administrative branch can use to make any features of any (legal) social media platforms illegal, or prevent them from being featured?  On the other side of this argument:  * What are some tools / cases social media can utilize, should the president of the United States decides to move against them?
What are the points of contention between competing plans for the next COVID-19 relief bill from the US Congress? In March the US Congress passed the [Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CARES_Act), a $2.2 trillion economic stimulus to compensate for the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Now the two houses are clashing between competing versions of the next phase: the Democratic-majority House of Representatives has passed the [Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions (HEROES) Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/6800) while the Republican-majority Senate has proposed the [Health, Economic Assistance, Liability Protection and Schools (HEALS) Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/1624).  What are the main differences between HEROES and HEALS? Who are the different leaders or factions who support one side or the other? And how does the US Congress's pandemic relief strategy compare with those adopted by other countries?
Do the federal Judiciary and Legislature in the United States play too large a role in public administration relative to Executive branch bureaucracies? In an article entitled [The Decay of American Political Institutions](https://www.the-american-interest.com/2013/12/08/the-decay-of-american-political-institutions/), Francis Fukuyama argues that the United States is undergoing a period of political decay.  His first proposition, the one I wish to discuss here, is that relative to other liberal democracies, the judiciary and legislature (and the two major political parties) continue to play outsized roles in American government at the expense of Executive Branch bureaucracies.  He contends that Americans’ traditional distrust of government has lead to judicial solutions for administrative problems, and that this arrangement is a very expensive and inefficient way to manage public administration.  He argues that the “judicialization of administration” makes implementing sound public policy almost impossible.*  I have several questions:   * (1) Is the “judicialization of administration” a real problem and is he correct in asserting that it is acute enough to contribute to the decline of American political institutions? * (2) Assuming he’s correct, are there any examples backed by empirical analysis that make his assertion true (other than the one I provided)? * (3) If he’s incorrect, how so? What counterfactuals contest his principal assertion?    *See this example from the linked article above:  >During the 1970s the Port of Oakland initiated plans to dredge the harbor in anticipation of the new, larger classes of container ships then coming into service. The plan, however, had to be approved by a host of governmental agencies, including the Army Corps of Engineers, the Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Marine Fisheries Service, the EPA, and their counterparts in the State of California. A succession of alternative plans for disposing of toxic materials dredged from the harbor was challenged in the courts, and each successive plan entailed prolonged delays and higher costs. The reaction of the EPA to these lawsuits was to retreat into a defensive crouch and go passive. The final plan to proceed with the dredging was not forthcoming until 1994, at an ultimate cost many times the original estimates.
How do countries handle representative apportionment and redistricting? Article I, Section 2 of the US Constitution [outlines](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei) the criteria for  how to choose the number of lawmakers yet does not mention the word "district". As such, [ redistricting in 35 of the 50 States](https://ballotpedia.org/State-by-state_redistricting_procedures) falls primarily to state legislatures while 7 States use independent commissions.    Over the decades, the process of redistricting and apportionment has been a highly contentious, resulting in [numerous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_v._Johnson) [Supreme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vieth_v._Jubelirer) [Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gill_v._Whitford) [cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rucho_v._Common_Cause) , eventually resulting in the decision that [the question of partisan apportionment, aka gerrymandering, is a political one that must be resolved outside of federal courts](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/us/what-is-gerrymandering.html). This leads me to wonder :  * How do other countries handle apportionment? * Do other countries use an equivalent to the American district? If so, how do they handle redistricting? * Is there evidence that certain political systems (e.g. the US two party system) are more susceptible to partisan gerrymandering?  * Have other countries instituted laws and processes with the intention of avoiding gerrymandering? How successful are these laws/programs? *  What policies or processes have US States adopted with the intention of avoiding gerrymandering? Is there evidence to suggest that the 7 States with independent commissions are successful in avoiding gerrymandering?
Is there evidence to suggest that the voting access activities in GOP controlled States are part of a larger national GOP strategy? For context, the [Republican Party's predominant demographic](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/06/02/in-changing-u-s-electorate-race-and-education-remain-stark-dividing-lines/) is shrinking, while it seems that the main demographic groups that traditionally support the Democratic Party [are growing](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/06/02/the-changing-composition-of-the-electorate-and-partisan-coalitions/).  The [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/13/voter-suppression-2020-democracy-america) published an article claiming incumbent Republicans, through a variety of different means, are suppressing, diminishing or otherwise chilling voting rights among predominantly Democratic constituencies.  Among the cases they use as examples include Florida, Georgia, Tennessee and Texas.  This article from [Mother Jones](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/06/02/in-changing-u-s-electorate-race-and-education-remain-stark-dividing-lines/) makes a similar claim and uses both Wisconsin and Georgia as evidence of this alleged strategy.   [Rollingstone](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-campaign-2020-voter-suppression-consent-decree-1028988/) wrote a long-form article on this topic, as did the [New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/article/156861/republican-voter-suppression-tactics-trump-2020).  These stories seem to be proliferating over time and I am curious if there's empirical evidence that supports or denies these allegations.  Do the cited examples represent isolated incidences, or are they apart of a larger GOP strategy?
What were the circumstances surrounding previous previous invocations of the suspension clause or the insurrection act and how does it compare to the circumstances in Portland? The US has recently experienced [numerous instances of both rioting and peaceful protests that were sparked by the killing of George Floyd](https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-protests) nearly two months ago. Most recently, [federal authorities have been spotted in Portland](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/19/portland-police-federal-agents-protest) making what some have claimed to be unlawful arrests during these protests and riots.  [Section 9 of Article 1](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/article-1/section-9/clause-2) of the US Constitution, which pertains to the legislative branch, declares: "The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it." However, in the past,[ it was the executive branch that invoked this power and authority during a different emergency](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jala/2629860.0029.205/--lincoln-s-suspension-of-the-writ-of-habeas-corpus?rgn=main;view=fulltext). In a proclamation, Lincoln argued that "the Constitution itself, is silent as to which, or who, is to exercise the power; and as the provision was plainly made for a dangerous emergency, it cannot be believed the framers of the instrument intended, that, in every case, the danger should run its course, until Congress could be called together; the very assembling of which might be prevented ... by the rebellion."  The current POTUS has repeatedly threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act ([1](https://dailycaller.com/2019/05/16/donald-trump-insurrection-act-illegal-immigration), [2](https://www.npr.org/2020/06/01/867467714/what-is-the-insurrection-act-that-trump-is-threatening-to-invoke)), which was last used during the [Rodney King riots](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/insurrection-act-was-last-used-1992-los-angeles-riots-invoking-n1224356) in Los Angeles nearly twenty years ago. Which leads me to wonder  * What were the circumstances surrounding previous invocations of the suspension clause and/or the Insurrection act and how do they compare to the current circumstances in Portland?  * If the suspension clause is indeed invoked, to what would the POTUS be held accountable during the period of invocation, and what would determine the length of this period?  This question pertains to a [recent statement POTUS made about a separate but concurrent emergency in the US](https://www.politico.com/states/california/story/2020/04/13/trump-claims-total-authority-over-state-decisions-1275506), that "When somebody’s president of the United States, the authority is total."
Is President Trump's order attempting to exclude persons without lawful immigration status from the census apportionment constitutional? Recently, President Trump [issued an executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-excluding-illegal-aliens-apportionment-base-following-2020-census/) which directs the Secretary of Commerce not to count persons unlawfully present in the United States as residents when conducting the 2020 census.  Several lawsuits have been filed challenging this order, most notably by [a large group of states and municipalities.](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7002643-July-24-2020-Complaint-for-State-of-New-York-Et.html)  The Trump memorandum says that the President has discretion  in this question and cites [Franklin v. Massachusetts](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17648124652753755136&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr) for that proposition.  The states challenging the order cite (among other cases) to [Plyler v. Doe](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12010798883027065807&q=plyler&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33) for holding that people without lawful status are still "persons" under the Constitution, and the [14th Amendment's](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv) requirement that:  >Representatives shall be apportioned among the several states according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each state, excluding Indians not taxed.  Is the Trump memorandum constitutionally sound?
Can US National Guard be deployed to defend citizens rights? Can the US National Guard be deployed by the Governor in a state to protect citizens, for example during a peaceful demonstration?   (To an outsider the governance of the US National Guard [1] seems very complicated and somewhat confusing, thereby my question.)  States which had National Guard deployments recently (2nd June 2020): https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/which-states-have-deployed-the-national-guard/ar-BB14UFHk  When can the National Guard be mobilized? PBS, (halfway through) https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/optics-matter-national-guard-deployments-amid-unrest-have-a-long-and-controversial-history  [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Guard#Duties_and_administrative_organization
Payroll tax reductions: Has the president specified exactly what he wants, and what statements have House/Senate members from each party made in response? This is a gap in my knowledge that I'd like to close.   I've been paying enough attention to see that the president wants a payroll tax reduction/holiday ([source](https://www.npr.org/2020/07/21/893605817/white-house-and-congress-at-odds-over-pandemic-relief-package), "the president is pushing for a payroll tax cut to be part of the package"), but that both parties otherwise seem to oppose the idea (from the same NPR article, ""Congressional Republicans have repeatedly rejected that idea" and "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has declined to draw any red lines in the negotiations but...").   However, I'd like to reiterate, I definitely don't know enough about this and I would like to learn more. Specifically:  - What are the details of - and stated reasons for - the president's proposed payroll tax cut? Is it proposed to be a reduction, removal, suspension, is there an expiration date, etc...?  - What are the stated reasons *Republicans* have opposed the idea?  - What are the stated reasons *Democrats* have opposed the idea?
Can local Law-Enforcement Officers arrest and detain federal agents for breach of state law? Currently there is a presence of Federal Law Enforcement Officers (LEOs) in Portland, Oregon.  This deployment was made despite the disapproval of, among other elected officials,  [the mayor of Portland and the governor of Oregon](https://www.opb.org/news/article/portland-mayor-ted-wheeler-tweets-federal-officers/).  The Federal LEOs have [been accused of abducting citizens off the streets in unmarked vans and without identification](https://www.opb.org/news/article/federal-law-enforcement-unmarked-vehicles-portland-protesters/), and other potential infringements of the civil rights of citizens, while the mayor and [governor](https://twitter.com/OregonGovBrown/status/1283913151700860928) have made public statements condemning the behavior and tactics of federal LEOs as worsening/escalating the situation.  These circumstances, particularly the civil rights abuse considerations, have prompting [the Attorney General of the state of Oregon to file a lawsuit](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/07/18/portland-oreland-ag-lawsuit/) against the federal government.  &#x200B;  My question is, aside from what could turn out to be the too-little-too-late results of a lawsuit, which may take a long time to work its way through the federal courts,  are there any more immediate strategies that local leaders and local LEO could take to curtail the power (and associated abuses thereof) of Federal agents acting in a similar manner as was seen in Portland?  &#x200B;  Specifically, (and putting issues of person and professional reluctance aside, strictly from a legal perspective), could local/state LEOs arrest federal LEOs on the spot for violating state and/or local law?  For instance, [ORS 166.025 (1)](https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/166.025) stipulates that (quoting potentially relevant subsections):  >A person commits the crime of disorderly conduct in the second degree  if, with intent to cause public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or  recklessly creating a risk thereof, the person:   >   >(a) Engages in fighting or in violent, tumultuous or threatening behavior;   >   >(c) Disturbs any lawful assembly of persons without lawful authority;  Furthermore, [ORS 166.015(1)](https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/166.015)defines the crime of rioting as:  >A person commits the crime of riot if while participating with five or  more other persons the person engages in tumultuous and violent conduct  and thereby intentionally or recklessly creates a grave risk of causing  public alarm.  Given the broad language of these statutes, as long as relevant authorities refused to deem protests as unlawful, could local/state LEOs legally arrest their federal colleagues on a violation of these or other relevant statutes?
What are the arguments for and against abolishing the Federal Minimum Wage in the U.S.? The Libertarian party has long held the position of [abolishing the federal minimum wage](https://dc.medill.northwestern.edu/blog/2016/08/16/eliminating-the-minimum-wage-inside-gary-johnsons-plan/#sthash.lVmmH6dm.dpbs), as they see it as being counter-productive to a functional free-market. They argue that it actually [hurts low-income, young, and minority workers](https://beinglibertarian.com/end-the-minimum-wage/) and does [more damage than good](https://fee.org/articles/the-case-for-abolishing-minimum-wage-laws/).   What are the arguments for and against abolishing the minimum wage in the U.S.? Has there been any precedent in other countries? If so, what were the results?
What are the legal authority and constraints of federal police in the US? To quell nightly protests outside a federal courthouse and county justice center in Portland, the US Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security [have deployed](https://www.opb.org/news/article/federal-law-enforcement-unmarked-vehicles-portland-protesters/) federal law-enforcement officers from the US Marshals and from Customs and Border Patrol. Unlike city police, these federal officers wear camouflaged military body armor with no badges or name tags and use unmarked vehicles outside of federal property to apprehend suspects, whom they may arrest and give a *Miranda* warning before detaining them the in federal courthouse. The Acting Secretary of Homeland Security [cited](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2020/07/16/acting-secretary-wolf-condemns-rampant-long-lasting-violence-portland) "violent anarchists"  committing numerous acts of vandalism and occasional confrontations with police in Portland. However, the mayor [indicated](https://www.opb.org/news/article/portland-mayor-ted-wheeler-tweets-federal-officers/) the federal officers were not invited to assist the city and criticized their methods. Oregon's Senator Jeff Merkley [condemned](https://twitter.com/SenJeffMerkley/status/1283852273089683464) the use of unmarked federal police to quell protests and Governor Kate Brown [publicly requested](https://twitter.com/OregonGovBrown/status/1283913151700860928) removal of all federal officers. But the Acting Secretary [publicly rebuffed](https://twitter.com/DHS_Wolf/status/1284081029683257344) that request.  This comes a little more than a month after unmarked federal police [were deployed](https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/local/dc/unmarked-police-officers-dc-riots-bureau-of-prisons-riot-squads/65-bc1c42a7-b05b-490c-9dab-eebb1b1bba20) to disperse protests in Washington, DC. When asked, those officers only identified themselves as "the federal government" or "Department of Justice", though the federal Bureau of Prisons (part of the DOJ) later confirmed those were its employees.   In reponse to the DC deployment, US Senators Chris Murphy and Chuck Schumer [proposed to pass legislation](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/i-was-horrified-democrats-seek-outlaw-unmarked-police-they-patrol-n1225016) that would require uniformed federal law-enforcement officers at protests to wear visible identification. A requirement for federal officers to verbally identify themselves before using force was subsequently [included](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/7120/text#toc-H47FCE599B6AA4B56BAA610E3E6426B11) in the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act of 2020, which was [passed by the House but not expected to have any chance with the Senate or presidential veto](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/25/us/politics/house-police-overhaul-bill.html).   So in the absence of such a reform, what is the current status of these federal police? What authority and constraints do they have when operating outside federal property, such as the streets of Portland? To arrest suspects, must they have probable cause for a federal crime rather than a state or municipal one, and if so are there any common infractions at protests that aren't covered by federal statutes? When federal and local police arrive at the same protest, how do they resolve jurisdiction? If civilians fail to recognize their police authority because they have no identifying marks ([several](https://lasvegassun.com/news/2020/jun/12/man-claiming-to-be-federal-agent-at-vegas-protest/) [different](https://helenair.com/news/local/man-accused-of-impersonating-police-at-montana-capitol-protest-charged-with-a-felony/article_4f13a829-736d-510d-a630-8217431466be.html) [vigilantes](https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2020/06/02/national-guard-man-arrested-impersonating-uniform-la-protest/) have been caught impersonating police at recent protests), does that uncertainty mitigate potential charges for interfering with law-enforcement actions or resisting arrest? And if local governments object to the presence or behavior of federal police, do they have any means to expel them?
What effect does HHS bypassing the CDC have on the public's ability to get accurate data on covid-19 hospitalizations in the US? As has been reported, the White House released new HHS guidelines [telling hospitals to bypass the CDC](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/us/politics/trump-cdc-coronavirus.html) and send their data directly to HHS. Because the CDC [publicly published this data](https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/covid19/report-patient-impact.html) and HHS's database will be private, there are concerns of how the data will be handled.  How does this effect the public's ability to get accurate data on covid-19 hospitalizations? Are there public sources of this data other than the CDC's site? Are there any ways to verify this data independently or otherwise ensure that bad data will not be manipulated or withheld?
Do US school districts choosing to be online-only risk violating the 14th amendment equal protection clause? [Several large us regions and districts are considering or have actually announced plans to continue online-only learning.](https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/13/us/school-reopening-plans-major-cities/index.html)  For example (from the above article):  >California's two largest school districts announced Monday that schools will not open for any in-person instruction when the academic year starts in August, and that students will continue to learn remotely. Los Angeles Unified School District and San Diego Unified School District are the largest school districts to date to forgo any type of in-person instruction.  [In earlier months, online learning presented a clear challenge to many families and areas because of inadequate or non-existent access to internet services.  Districts and governments offered some solutions such as hotspots, but those do not work adequately in rural areas and add significant hardship to families in other areas.](https://edsource.org/2020/more-california-students-are-online-but-digital-divide-runs-deep-with-distance-learning/630456)  >Over the last few weeks, state leaders have said that an estimated one in five California students — approximately [1.2 million](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/04/20/governor-newsom-announces-cross-sector-partnerships-to-support-distance-learning-and-bridge-the-digital-divide/) — lacked broadband or a computer to access distance learning. The problems are particularly acute in rural areas, where only 34% of households are subscribed to an internet service compared with 78% in urban areas, according to an EdSource analysis of 2018 data.   >   >Major progress has already been made as districts, private donors and elected officials rush to get devices to students, but hundreds of thousands of students remain unable to access online learning.  and  >Rural schools are finding mobile WiFi devices don’t work at all for students in some of the most remote parts of the state that lack broadband infrastructure. That’s the case in Del Norte Unified, which consists of 11 schools and is the single district within Del Norte County, which reaches the Oregon border.   >   >“A lot of students are in places where there isn’t consistent power, let alone internet,” said Ryan Bahten, director of information network services for Del Norte Unified, located just south of the Oregon border. “These hotspots are a nonstarter for us,” referring to WiFi devices donated by T-Mobile to the California Department of Education.  In the landmark case Brown v Board of Education, the [court opinion](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/347/483/USSC_PRO_347_483_1) seemed to make it clear that equal access to schooling is a constitutionally protected right:  >Today, education is perhaps the most important function of state and local governments. Compulsory school attendance laws and the great expenditures for education both demonstrate our recognition of the importance of education to our democratic society. It is required in the performance of our most basic public responsibilities, even service in the armed forces. It is the very foundation of good citizenship. Today it is a principal instrument in awakening the child to cultural values, in preparing him for later professional training, and in helping him to adjust normally to his environment. In these days, it is doubtful that any child may reasonably be expected to succeed in life if he is denied the opportunity of an education. Such an opportunity, where the state has undertaken to provide it, is a right which must be made available to all on equal terms.  Regardless of the specific situation in California, do districts risk running afoul of 14th amendment protections if they are unable to provide equal access to online learning for all students and have chosen to be online-only?
What evidence supports/discourages raising the minimum wage? As far as I can tell, there is evidence on both sides of this issue.  On one hand, some people aren't able to live off of minimum wage when working full time: https://livingwage.mit.edu/states/06 (This of course is dependent on location. Switch to, say, Wyoming and it might look different.) In addition, an increased minimum wage would supposedly require very little increase in prices and/or decrease in profit taking (a 10% increase in minimum wage is correlated with a 0.3% increase in CPI, see page 3): https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/research-department-working-paper/2017/the-local-aggregate-effects-of-minimum-wage-increases.aspx#:~:text=Abstract,outcomes%20besides%20employment%20and%20wages.&text=minimum-wage%20workers.-,Increases%20in%20minimum%20wages%20also%20lower%20debt%20among%20households%20with,to%20increase%20access%20to%20credit.  On the other hand, small businesses get hurt more than franchises: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027843191830968X It seems reasonable to assume that most people would not accept a job that would not provide for them sufficiently (page 6): https://www.peri.umass.edu/fileadmin/pdf/working_papers/working_papers_51-100/WP61.pdf And finally, many people in minimum wage jobs simply view it as a temporary gig or a stepping stone on the way to something better: https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/minimum-wage/2017/home.htm  What other pros/cons do you see and which position makes the most sense overall?
How would the US federal government ban a website without requiring a new law from Congress? # Questions  What is the most likely or most viable way that the US federal government could ban a website (or app) without requiring a new law from Congress?  What challenges would that ban face?  Bonus question: What tends to be the threshold(s) that a Chinese owned company must exceed (% of Chinese ownership, activities, proof of censorship, proof of embedded CCP members, etc) for that company or their products to receive sanction-like actions from the US that go beyond standard regulations?  # Context  US White House administration confirmed that WeChat and TikTok [are each facing scrutiny in the US](https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/wechat-backlash-us/) and the administration is threatening to ban them.  Every major internet censorship initiative that I know of at the national level [are acts of congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_in_the_United_States#Computer_Fraud_and_Abuse_Act_(CFAA)).  Even the best explanations I can find about how a ban would work cast significant doubt on any options that do not need congressional approval:  * US Commerce Department could put TikTok on its ["entity" list](https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/policy-guidance/lists-of-parties-of-concern/entity-list)  but the US government blocking traffic to TikTok is "unlikely to succeed given our legal systems." *  The administration has limited authority to ban outright any specific piece of software, like an app. EFF general council says "There is no law that would authorize the federal government to ban ordinary American from using an app." * A law or executive order that targets TikTok could spur a challenge under the First Amendment using rulings such as [Bernstein v. DOJ](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/04/remembering-case-established-code-speech), in which the court found a computer scientist had the First Amendment right to publish an encryption algorithm.  * "The Committee on Foreign Investment in the US is [already investigating TikTok](https://www.cnet.com/news/us-launches-a-national-security-review-of-tiktok-report/) for national security concerns...could end up requiring changes to TikTok's substantial operations inside the US." But that started in November 2019, and its not clear to me when that wraps up and what impact it can have in the grand scheme of things.  EDIT: Clarified I meant blocking a website or app
What implications does the Hong Kong Security Law have for foreigners visiting China or Hong Kong? And what implications does it have for Taiwan? Some background on the Security Law:  [https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-52765838](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-52765838)  Full text:  [https://hongkongfp.com/2020/07/01/in-full-english-translation-of-the-hong-kong-national-security-law/](https://hongkongfp.com/2020/07/01/in-full-english-translation-of-the-hong-kong-national-security-law/)   As stated in the title, China has passed a security law that explicitly outlaws, in broad terms, secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with foreign forces that seek to " \[separate\] the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region or any other part of the People’s Republic of China from the People’s Republic of China " (see Article 20). This law appears to apply to non-permanent residents of HK (so HK citizens living outside of HK) and people from outside HK. See Article 38 :    *This Law shall apply to offences under this Law committed against the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region from outside the Region by a person who is not a permanent resident of the Region.*  In addition, the law also appears to apply to companies that operate in HK and those that do not. See Article 31:  *An incorporated or unincorporated body such as a company or an organisation which commits an offence under this Law shall be imposed with a criminal fine.*  To my understanding, this cannot be enforced upon non-Chinese citizens residing outside of HK or China. However, I have some questions.  *  What are the implications of the Hong Kong Security Law on foreigners visiting China or Hong Kong? Are there specific implications for Taiwan? * Does the law allow the [CCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_China) to request a foreign citizen be extradited for crimes committed under the security law and is there precedence for this? * Does the law allow the CCP to arrest a foreign citizen who enters HK or China under the security law?
Is Trump's "Garden of Heroes" Legal? Trump signed an [Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-building-rebuilding-monuments-american-heroes/) on July 3rd to create a “Garden of American Heroes,” likely in response to protests and discussions of removing monuments.  But can he do that? Is it legal for him to unilaterally declare that?
Is there a mechanism for US voters to deny both candidates? In 2016 Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton were both seen as unfavorable by a majority of the country. [Source](https://news.gallup.com/poll/197231/trump-clinton-finish-historically-poor-images.aspx)  Currently Donald Trump is facing a 38% approval rating [Source](https://news.gallup.com/poll/313454/trump-job-approval-rating-steady-lower-level.aspx), and nearly 61% of voters think that Joe Biden needs to prove he doesn't have dementia (38% are already convinced he is suffering from it) [Source ](https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections/election_2020/38_of_voters_think_biden_has_dementia)   Less than half of voting eligible US citizens voted in the last election.

Is there an option for those that feel like the current candidates don't represent them properly?
What evidence supports Vietnam's COVID19 case reports? Vietnam holds the world's [15th highest population](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/), and holds a [relatively high population density](https://www.statista.com/statistics/264683/top-fifty-countries-with-the-highest-population-density/) [as the 30th most densely populated country](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population_density) while another site ranks Vietnam as the [47th most densely populated](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/countries-by-density). Nevertheless, Vietnam's population density appears to hover above the median. To compare, Japan's population density is [899 people per square mile](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/japan-population/), which is remarkably similar to [Vietnam's 813 people per square mile](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/vietnam-population/).     However, as of July 4th, 2020, Vietnam is reported to have [355 coronavirus cases and 0 deaths](https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-maps-and-cases/). The similarly dense Japan has [19,068 coronavirus cases and 976 deaths](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/japan/).     News articles have praised the Vietnamese government's ability to stave off the virus attributing their success to [early quarantining measures](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-52628283),  [contact tracing](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/05/12/vietnam-coronavirus-pandemic-success-repression/), and [transparent communication](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-exemplar-vietnam). Yet it should be noted that Vietnam does not have a stellar track record when it comes to [free press](https://freedomhouse.org/country/vietnam/freedom-net/2019).     What evidence supports Vietnam's COVID19 case reports?
With the recent Supreme Court case, What are the Constitutional arguments for and against the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact? As mentioned above, the Supreme Court just [ruled](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-rules-faithless-electors-can-t-go-rogue-electoral-n1231394) that States could pass laws forbidding "faithless electors". This ruling would allow for States to prevent the electors from voting in a way that the State deems incorrect, whether that is the popular vote in the State, or in theory, the national popular vote.  The biggest hurdle for the [National Popular Vote Interstate Compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Popular_Vote_Interstate_Compact) past getting the necessary States to sign would be its Constitutionality and whether the Courts would allow for such a compact under the Constitution. What are the Constitutional arguments for and against this sort of compact?
Who is the rightful president of Venezuela, on what grounds, and how can it be interpreted so differently by different countries and institutions? Nicolas Maduro [won](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/21/venezuela-elections-nicolas-maduro-wins-second-term) the presidential election in Venezuela, but his victory is [disputed](https://www.npr.org/2013/04/16/177427309/venezuelas-presidential-election-remains-disputed) by the opposition. Not long after, the European Union [backed](https://amp.dw.com/en/venezuela-eu-backs-juan-guaido-as-national-assembly-head/a-53689379) Juan Guaido, head of the opposition-majority in the National Assembly. He then went ahead to call himself the president of Venezuela, yet the Venezuelan Supreme Court [claimed](https://en.mercopress.com/2020/06/05/eu-ratifies-that-juan-guaido-is-the-legitimate-congressional-president-in-venezuela) Maduro was still the rightful president. It has even went so far that a British court has ruled that Venezuela’s gold reserves [belong](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-gold-britain/britain-recognizes-guaido-as-venezuelas-president-in-gold-dispute-judge-rules-idUSKBN2431CG) to Guaido’s administration rather than to Maduro’s.  But who is right and why? What political mechanisms speak for or against Maduro and Guaido? Who is the legitimate president from a constitutional perspective?
Is there evidence that likely voters choosing to vote third-party (or not at all) has an impact on the major parties' platform in future elections? There are left leaning voters who express an [unwillingness to vote](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/democrats-confront-a-never-biden-contingent-127438) for [Joe Biden, who is the presumptive Democratic nominee](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/06/06/joe-biden-clinches-democratic-presidential-nomination-2020-election/5310225002/), in hopes that it will force the Democratic party cater to more to their goals in order to earn their vote ([see this article](https://miscellanynews.org/2020/04/10/opinions/dont-beg-me-to-vote-for-biden/), for example). I found some research on how *primary election* voting affects the platforms in the general election—[Woon, 2017](http://www.pitt.edu/~woon/papers/woon-primaries-aug17.pdf), for example—but nothing about how third-party votes affect the platforms of major parties.  So some things I'm trying to ascertain:  * Does voting third party/not voting have a noticeable impact on party platforms? If so, does it push the parties away from the center, or closer?  * If strategic voting *doesn't* accomplish these voters' expressed goals, are there other proven strategies they can use to alter the party platform to their preference?
What is known about the procedures that govern how a decision is made by the SCOTUS? Does the Chief Justice's role differ than the Associate Justices? The Supreme Court recently ruled on 5 to 4 on [June Medical Services v. Russo](https://apnews.com/c9c6eee97277d6e8e71f568cde830e46), an abortion access case originating from Louisiana. Joining the majority was Chief Justice Roberts [who in a similar case from 2016](https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/503645-all-eyes-on-roberts-ahead-of-supreme-courts-abortion-ruling), was part of the dissenting opinion.   This lead me to wonder   • What is known about the procedures and guidelines that govern how a decision made by the SCOTUS? Are they permitted to openly deliberate?   • During the decision making process, does the Chief Justice's role differ than that the Associate Justices? For example, could any difference in role explain why Chief Justice Robert's was part of the majority opinion in today's case while being in the dissenting opinion in the very similar case back in 2016?
[META] r/NeutralPolitics announcements Hello r/NeutralPolitics users,  We have a few things to announce:  * After a long hiatus, our news subreddit, r/NeutralNews, has just relaunched. See the [announcement here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/neutralnews/comments/hi25c6/meta_rneutralnews_has_relaunched/) * We're going to be launching a new subreddit for fact checking soon. Submission Rule E in r/NeutralPolitics prohibits requests for fact checking, so when we'd get submissions in that format, we would often refer them to r/politicalfactchecking. Unfortunately, that subreddit [recently shut down,](https://www.reddit.com/r/politicalfactchecking/comments/gb8987/a_message_to_all_users_of_rpoliticalfactchecking/) so we decided to create our own and we'd like your feedback on how it should run. Please visit r/NeutralFactChecking to join the discussion about our new venture. * We're planning to rework /r/NeutralTalk (again) to make it more useful and popular. There's a [discussion thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralTalk/comments/hi2ege/meta_proposals_to_reform_rneutraltalk/) over there if you want to comment and shape what it will become. * We removed a line from our sidebar that read: "Your post or comment will be judged not by its perspective, but by its style, rationale, and informational content." This line had already been removed from the guidelines, but it got inadvertently left in the sidebar text about neutrality. It was causing confusion, so we eliminated it.

Does the 2017 repeal of the individual mandate invalidate the ACA and, if so, how? I searched the sub but didn’t find anything concerning the 2017 ruling.  I apologize if I indeed overlooked it.    Thursday night the Trump administration joined Texas and 17 other states in asking the US Supreme Court to [overturn the Affordable Care Act.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/politics/obamacare-trump-administration-supreme-court.html?referringSource=articleShare).     From the article: “In his brief, Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco argued that the health law’s two remaining central provisions are now invalid because Congress intended that all three work together.”   After searching for provisions in the ACA, there appears to be quite a lot, so I’m confused as to the “three” the SG is referring to and, additionally, how each relies on the other.
What are the facts surrounding the Michael Flynn prosecution case? BACKGROUND: Former Trump National Security Adviser Michael Flynn was charged and pled guilty to [lying to the FBI](https://www.npr.org/2017/12/01/561238303/michael-flynn-sr-expected-to-plead-guilty-to-lying-to-fbi) about contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Specifically, he lied about conversations he had with Kislyak, regarding Sanctions and about Israeli settlements:  > Flynn requested that Russia not retaliate against the punitive measures just imposed by the U.S., the court papers say. Flynn then called the transition official to report on his discussion. The following day, Russia announced that it would not take retaliatory measures against the U.S.  and  > Flynn also engaged in a similar back-and-forth with the Russian ambassador over a U.N. Security Council vote on a resolution condemning Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. The incoming Trump administration opposed the resolution, and Flynn asked the Russian envoy to either oppose the measure or delay it. Flynn was directed by a "very senior member" of the transition team to make the request, court papers say.  Flynn ultimately pled guilty to the charges and made a statement afterwards, saying:  > "My guilty plea and agreement to cooperate with the special counsel's office reflect a decision I made in the best interests of my family and of our country. I accept full responsibility for my actions,"  [source](https://www.npr.org/2020/05/08/852582068/mike-flynn-pleaded-guilty-why-is-the-justice-department-dropping-the-charges)  On April 30, a judge ruled that the documents pertaining to the Flynn case be unsealed, which included hand-written FBI notes when his FBI interview took place. These notes were the basis of the argument that the interview was essentially a setup, and the FBI had no case against Michael Flynn. [source](https://www.npr.org/2020/04/30/848179290/judge-unseals-documents-related-to-michael-flynns-fbi-interview)  On May 7, the Department of Justice announced they were [dropping the case against Michael Flynn](https://www.npr.org/2020/05/07/852247792/justice-department-is-dropping-case-against-ex-trump-adviser-michael-flynn), despite previously recommending his sentence.  Attorney General Bill Barr claimed:  > "A crime can not be established here," Barr said on CBS News on Thursday evening. "They did not have a basis for a counter-intelligence investigation against Flynn at that stage."  And just today, an Appeals Court voted 2-1 to [order a lower judge to throw out the case against Michael Flynn](https://www.npr.org/2020/06/24/882787253/appeals-court-orders-lower-judge-to-throw-out-michael-flynn-case)  So, with all of that being said, I just want to try to understand what *are* the facts surrounding what has happened recently with the Flynn case, specifically regarding the FBI notes, the Department of Justice's decision to change their sentencing recommendation and completely drop the case, and now an appeals court ruling that a lower judge must drop the case.   I also want to know what evidence exists that supports the argument that Michael Flynn did not commit a crime.
Is there evidence that allowing state actors to discriminate against or grant preferential treatment to protected classes promote equal opportunity? If so, how? [The California Assembly has passed an act to put a repeal of a state civil rights amendment on the ballot.](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200ACA5) In pertinent part:  > The California Constitution, pursuant to provisions enacted by the initiative Proposition 209 in 1996, prohibits the state from discriminating against, or granting preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting. The California Constitution defines the state for these purposes to include the state, any city, county, public university system, community college district, school district, special district, or any other political subdivision or governmental instrumentality of, or within, the state.  > This measure would repeal these provisions. The measure would also make a statement of legislative findings in this regard.  > WHEREAS, Equal opportunity is deeply rooted in the American ideals of fairness, justice, and equality. Programs to meet the goals of equal opportunity seek to realize these basic values. Equal opportunity not only helps individuals, but also helps communities in need and benefits our larger society. California’s equal opportunity program was upended by the passage of Proposition 209 in 1996...  Is there evidence that allowing state actors to discriminate against or grant preferential treatment to protected classes promote equal opportunity? If so, what is the evidence and how would that work?  Edit: Please stick to evidence relevant to whether or not allowing state actors to discriminate or grant preferential treatment would be consistent with ACA 5's stated purpose of promoting equal opportunity.
What has been going on in Baltimore since 2015 that’s caused it’s homicide and general crime rate to rise while its population has dropped? According to this article from Propublica and the New York Times,   https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/magazine/baltimore-tragedy-crime.html  Deaths by homicide in Baltimore had dropped below 200 in 2011, the lowest in over 40 years. Fast forward 8 years later, and Baltimore has hit a new *high* in homicides, with 348 people dead. The highest for a city in the United States.  We’ve seen an economic *contraction* in many places inside the city. The high speed rail project that was due to come was cancelled by the state government.   One of the major retail centers in the poorer neighborhoods of the city, Target, has completely shut down.   The population itself, after seeing moderate growth through 2014 has started to drop to *two decade lows.*  So my question is, what the hell happened here?
Can the Attorney General or the President fire Geoffrey Berman, the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York? Late yesterday, Attorney General Bill Barr said in a [press release](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-william-p-barr-nomination-jay-clayton-serve-us-attorney-southern-district) that the chief prosecutor for SDNY, US Attorney Geoffrey Berman, was "stepping down" from that position. The administration [named a new acting head of the office](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/president-donald-trump-fires-us-attorney-southern-district/story?id=71357518) and also disclosed who they would be nominating as the permanent replacement. However, Berman responded by releasing a [statement](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/statement-us-attorney-geoffrey-s-berman-announcement-attorney-general-barr) ([mirror](https://twitter.com/SDNYnews/status/1274178732476059650/photo/1)) saying he wasn't leaving:  > I have not resigned, and have no intention of resigning, my position, to which I was appointed by the Judges of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.  I will step down when a presidentially appointed nominee is confirmed by the Senate.  Until then, our investigations will move forward without delay or interruption.   This situation sets up an unusual conflict. Generally, [the AG has the right to fire any prosecutor,](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-justice/defiant-u-s-prosecutor-fired-by-trump-administration-idUSKBN16I0PZ) but the special circumstance here is that Berman was not actually confirmed by the Senate, but rather, was [appointed by the judges of the district.](https://web.archive.org/web/20200524214610/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/25/nyregion/geoffrey-berman-us-attorney-manhattan.html)  That being the case, can the AG or President actually fire him? What can they do if he refuses to leave? What are the wider implications of a confrontation like this with a prosecutor who is in charge of the district [where the president's businesses operate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization) and office that has [prosecuted many of his associates?](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/09/new-york-southern-district-donald-trump-inauguration-prosecutors)  ----  UPDATE 1: AG Barr sent a [letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6953481-6-20-20-Barr-Letter-to-Berman.html) to Berman advising him that he has been fired by the President, citing the precedent that allows the President to remove him even without a Senate confirmed replacement, and addressing Berman's implication that current investigations are in jeopardy. By contrast, the President [claims no involvement in any of it.](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/20/politics/trump-fires-berman-barr-says/index.html)  UPDATE 2: Standoff ends as [Berman resigns:](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-justice-newyork-barr-berman/stand-off-with-attorney-general-barr-ends-as-new-york-prosecutor-agrees-to-resign-idUSKBN23R0VZ?il=0) “In light of Attorney General Barr’s decision to respect the normal operation of law and have Deputy U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss become Acting U.S. Attorney, I will be leaving the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, effective immediately.” [Berman's full statement.](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/statement-geoffrey-s-berman)
Historically, have SCOTUS rulings regarding protected classes and employment led to shifts in the implementation of employment law, such as more wrongful termination legal rulings? Or are such rulings mostly symbolic victories? SCOTUS recently [ruled](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/15/us/gay-transgender-workers-supreme-court.html?auth=login-google) 6-3 that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 applies to employment discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, and that is unlawful to fire someone for either. This decision is being [hailed](https://www.npr.org/2020/06/15/863498848/supreme-court-delivers-major-victory-to-lgbtq-employees) as a significant victory for trans and gay rights.  However, many [states](https://www.rocketlawyer.com/article/what-states-are-at-will-employment-states-ps.rl) have [at-will employment](https://www.ncsl.org/research/labor-and-employment/at-will-employment-overview.aspx#:~:text=At%2Dwill%20means%20that%20an,with%20no%20adverse%20legal%20consequences), meaning employees can be fired for any reason not specifically protected (such as race, religion, and now, sexual orientation, etc.) or for no reason at all.  Do such rulings historically lead to shifts in employment practices or more successful wrongful termination cases? Or is their power more symbolic, with at-will laws trumping the arguments for termination on unlawful grounds? What would precedent lead us to believe might happen here?
What effect do utilities commissions actually have on utility rates? What effect do utilities commissions actually have on utility rates?   In the US state of Arizona, there is a part of government called the [Arizona Corporation Commission](https://www.azcc.gov/divisions "In Arizona it is sometimes called the fourth branch of government."):   >Article 15 of the Arizona Constitution establishes the Arizona Corporation Commission. Only 7 states have constitutionally formed Commissions. Arizona is one of only 13 states with elected Commissioners. In the 37 other states, Commissioners are appointed by either the governor or the legislature.  >In most states, the Commission is known as the Public Service Commission or the Public Utility Commission. Our Commission, however, has responsibilities that go beyond traditional public utilities regulation. These additional roles include facilitating the incorporation of businesses and organizations, securities regulation and railroad/pipeline safety.  Based on these claims from the AZCC's website, most US states have a similar body handling utilities only. This type of organization is the focus of this question.   There are different ways of handling these commissions as well, for example, whereas some states like Arizona elect their commission members directly, many states such as [California have the governor appoint their members](https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/history/ "While many states use this method, the exact details do vary from state to state."), and a couple [have their legislature do it, such as Virginia](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title12.1/chapter2/section12.1-6/ "Virginia should really put this on their State Corporation Commission's website.").   Arizona's Corporation Commission, again as an example, has final say on whether or not certain utilities can raise their rates, such as [electrical](https://tucson.com/business/tucson/rate-increases-for-tep-trico-to-be-set-at-wednesdays-hearing-in-tucson/article_5a9cdbbd-e828-516d-bf84-5358045b9bfc.html "This is a dry news article about something that affects hundreds of thousands of people.") [rates](https://tucson.com/business/tucson/rate-increases-approved-for-tucson-electric-trico-customers/article_3d46b1f5-70fc-5a69-b164-3f27a1c109da.html "But a dry news article like this one is necessary to ask a simple question."), or [water rates](https://www.epcor.com/products-services/water/rates-tariffs-usa/Pages/interim-arizona-water-rates.aspx "Does the fact that this is about water make this page about rates not dry?").   Do states or jurisdictions with an active or more powerful utilities commission impact utility rates to be higher or lower vs areas that do not? Does the method of electing the members of this commission impact utility rates in any way?
Policy Successes of Black Lives Matter Organization **EDIT:** While I appreciate all of your answers to this question, I see now I was not clear in my distinction between the Black Lives Matter movement, and Black Lives Matter Global Network Inc., whose website I linked. In my questions below, and in my title of this post, when I reference the "Black Lives Matter organization" (which I admit is a misnomer, though I'll leave the questions unedited for transparency), I mean specifically Black Lives Matter Global Network Inc., and I'm curious about what they've accomplished with respect to policy. I take full responsibility for the confusion, and I apologize.  In the wake of [George Floyd's death](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/05/30/video-timeline-george-floyd-death/), the phrase "Black Lives Matter" has been a part of [celebrity social media posts](https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2020/06/11/celebrities-black-lives-matter-movement/), [official corporate communications](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/06/13/after-years-marginalizing-black-employees-customers-corporate-america-says-black-lives-matter/), and [art on the streets of a few US cities](https://dcist.com/story/20/06/12/the-standoff-over-d-c-s-black-lives-matter-mural-illustrated/).  Likewise, donations to groups that focus on combating issues around racial prejudice and race-based inequities have reportedly skyrocketed. Specifically, according to [this article](https://www.nytimes.com./2020/06/14/us/politics/black-lives-matter-racism-donations.html) in the New York Times:   > "ActBlue, the leading site to process online donations for Democratic > causes and campaigns, has experienced its busiest period since its > founding in 2004, far surpassing even the highest peaks of the 2020 > presidential primary season. (ActBlue confirmed that racial justice > causes and bail funds had led the way.) The site’s four biggest days > ever came consecutively this month as it processed more than $250 > million to various progressive causes and candidates in two-plus > weeks, according to a New York Times analysis of the site’s donation > ticker."  That being said, some organizations are more forthcoming about what their funds are responsible for than others. For example, [the NAACP's organizational history page](https://www.naacp.org/nations-premier-civil-rights-organization/) describes their involvement in the processes of the "integration of the armed forces in 1948 but also passage of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1964, and 1968 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965."  The Black Lives Matter website, however, gives far less information than those of comparable organizations. The group's pages within their "About" section dedicated to their history as an organization (namely the "[About Black Lives Matter,](https://blacklivesmatter.com/about/)" "[6 Years Strong,](https://blacklivesmatter.com/six-years-strong/)" and "[Herstory,](https://blacklivesmatter.com/herstory/)" pages) all mention the group's formation in 2013-2014, but they don't mention any other significant dates important to the group, or policy successes that the group was responsible for. The only place on the website which does list significant dates and initiatives seems to be the site's [Global Actions page](https://blacklivesmatter.com/global-actions/), which as of posting has not been updated beyond February 2019 (here is a link to the Wayback Machine's [snapshot of this page c. June 13, 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200613093333/https://blacklivesmatter.com/global-actions/) for posterity).  This leads me to wonder:  1) Has the Black Lives Matter organization been responsible for changes in policy at the local, state, or federal level in pursuance of their mission?  2 ) If so, what are those changes, and is there any evidence that they have successfully brought the locality, state, or country wherein they were enacted closer to the organization's vision?
How does the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone compare to historical nonhierarchical or anarchist collectives? In Seattle demonstrators have [taken over a small area in and around a police station](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/06/12/seattle-protest-chaz-capitol-hill-autonomous-zone-police-free/3173968001/) in the Capitol Hill area.  They have dubbed it the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ).  I am wondering how this compares to some past historical examples of nonhierarchical or anarchist collectives.  A few possible comparisons:  [The Paris Commune (1871)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Commune)  [Revolutionary Catalonia (1936-1939)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_Catalonia)  [The Ukranian "Free Territory" (1918-1921)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makhnovia)  Are these comparable situations at all?  Are there more apt comparisons on a smaller scale?  If these are apt comparisons, does it provide any lessons for the demonstrators or government to use in respect to the CHAZ?
Do the Amash and Nadler proposals related to qualified immunity meaningfully differ? If so, how? Last week, Rep. Justin Amash (L-MI) alongside Ayanna Pressley and a number of other House Democrats introduced [HR 7085](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/7085) which they style the "Ending Qualified Immunity Act" [PDF](https://pressley.house.gov/sites/pressley.house.gov/files/Ending%20Qualified%20Immunity%20Act_0.pdf)  The key clause of the bill says:  >Section 1979 of the Revised Statutes (42 U.S.C.  1983) is amended by adding at the end the following: ‘‘It  shall not be a defense or immunity to any action brought  under this section that the defendant was acting in good  faith, or that the defendant believed, reasonably or otherwise, that his or her conduct was lawful at the time when  it was committed. Nor shall it be a defense or immunity  that the rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the  Constitution or laws were not clearly established at the  time of their deprivation by the defendant, or that the  state of the law was otherwise such that the defendant  could not reasonably have been expected to know whether  his or her conduct was lawful.’’.   Subsequently, House Democratic leadership including [Speaker Pelosi](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/democrats-unveil-broad-police-reform-bill-pledge-to-transform-law-enforcement/2020/06/08/1ed07d7a-a992-11ea-94d2-d7bc43b26bf9_story.html) announced a bill introduced by Judiciary Chairman Nadler [PDF](https://judiciary.house.gov/uploadedfiles/justice_in_policing_act_of_2020.pdf?utm_campaign=2926-519) which also contains a provision related to qualified immunity.  It says:  >Section 1979 of the Revised Statutes of the United  States (42 U.S.C. 1983) is amended by adding at the end  the following: ‘‘It shall not be a defense or immunity to  any action brought under this section against a local law  enforcement officer (as defined in section 2 of the Justice  in Policing Act of 2020) or a State correctional officer  (as defined in section 1121(b) of title 18, United States  Code) that—   >> ‘‘(1) the defendant was acting in good faith, or  that the defendant believed, reasonably or otherwise, that his or her conduct was lawful at the time when  the conduct was committed; or   >>‘‘(2) the rights, privileges, or immunities se4 cured by the Constitution and laws were not clearly  established at the time of their deprivation by the  defendant, or that at this time, the state of the law  was otherwise such that the defendant could not reasonably have been expected to know whether his or her conduct was lawful.’’.   Do these provisions meaningfully differ?  If so, what are the key differences?    ---  For some background for those not familiar, qualified immunity is a legal doctrine interpreting [42 U.S.C. 1983.](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1983) Sec 1983 is a statute passed during reconstruction under the enforcement clause of the 14th amendment which allows federal lawsuits against state officials who violate civil rights.  [Qualified immunity](https://www.lawfareblog.com/what-qualified-immunity-and-what-does-it-have-do-police-reform) interprets that law to imply a right not to face trial on such a lawsuit unless the law was "clearly established" by a past judicial precedent on basically the same facts.
The Minneapolis City Council has pledged to vote to disband it's police force. Does this have precedence? What alternatives may exist? A veto-proof majority of the Minneapolis City Council has vowed to to de-fund and disband their police force.(https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/07/us/george-floyd-protests-sunday/index.html).  What precedent does such a move have historically? Have other communities done something like this before? What was the result of such actions?  Most importantly, what possible avenues does the city have to replace the functions of the police force? Washington Post has a write-up on what such a move likely intends, but have there been other alternatives put forward? Currently it seems that the intention would be to move many of the police force's current responsibilities to more specialized organizations.(https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/06/07/defund-police-heres-what-that-really-means/)
Articles claim that America's influence on the rest of the world is declining. What methods can be implied in America in order to tackle these issues effectively? These articles ([article 1](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/world/asia/george-floyd-protest-global.html) \+ [article 2](https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/a-nation-in-decline-martin-scicluna.791573)) claim how the mass protests against the murder of George Floyd has influence how America is viewed worldwide as it states on the very beginning of the article that countries like China and Iran 'criticized on human rights by the Trump administration, called the killing of Mr. Floyd a symbol of American hypocrisy'. Others have weighed America's decline based on other factors such as its current leadership ([link 1](https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/decline-us-global-leadership-power-without-authority) and [link 2](https://apnews.com/d8a59e876979f38bbd852a701f495ca1)) and its response to the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-coronavirus-has-exposed-political-cracks-leading-to-a-disintegrating-europe-a-declining-america-and-a-shrinking-china-2020-05-07)   Claims that America's influence worldwide is decreasing was stated even before the current events of the COVID-19 pandemic and the current protests ([link 1](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/08/americas-global-influence-is-declining/568708/) \+ [link  2](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/02/14/more-people-around-the-world-see-u-s-power-and-influence-as-a-major-threat-to-their-country/)  \+ [link 3](https://www.france24.com/en/20200605-china-revels-in-us-protests-sees-unrest-as-pr-opportunity) ).  &#x200B;  So in order to address these issues, what policies can America enact to improve or restore its influence in the world?  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;
What kind of legal action (if any) can foreign governments take on the US if their media personnel are assaulted? There have been quite a few countries that have dispatched reporters to follow the protests that are breaking out around the US.  [Several of those reporters have been assaulted](https://time.com/5846497/journalists-police-george-floyd-protests/) during these protests turned violent.  Do members of the foreign press have any protections from these instances, and if so, what kind of consequences can occur if those protections are violated?
What are the laws/regulations surrounding the shielding of badge numbers by members of the police? During many of the protests occurring right now in the United States in response to police brutality, many police officers are wearing bands that [obscure or block their badge numbers](https://m.seattlepi.com/local/seattlenews/article/Seattle-protest-police-mourning-bands-badge-number-15314157.php). Badge numbers may be used for identifying officers when filing complaints.  What laws/regulations require the police to display their badge numbers and what legal exceptions allow them to obscure those numbers? If obscuring is prohibited, what are the repercussions for obscuring said badge numbers?
What are the historical standards of invoking the Insurrection Act? President Trump declared that he would deploy ["thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement officers"](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/01/politics/donald-trump-national-address-race/index.html) if needed to restore order in states around the country due to [the protests stemming from the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.](https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/george-floyd-protests-06-01-20/index.html)  [The Insurrection Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurrection_Act) allows the president to deploy military troops within the United States to suppress civil disorder, insurrection, and rebellion, but the act states that unless military troops are requested by a state, the president cannot deploy troops by order unless it becomes "impracticable to enforce federal laws through ordinary proceedings or if states are unable to safeguard its inhabitants' civil rights".  Additionally, [Posse Comitatus Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posse_Comitatus_Act) further limits the president's powers to deploy military troops within the united states, although it does have a specific exclusion for the Insurrection Act.  Which leads me to wonder, what are the historical standards of invoking the Insurrection Act? What were the circumstances behind the invocation?  Has the Insurrection Act ever been invoked but later found to be in violation of the Posse Comitatus Act?
What are the rules of engagement for US police dealing with protesters and journalists, and how are they enforced? As [protests continue across the US](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/minneapolis-george-floyd-protest-may31-1.5592200) following the video-recorded death of George Floyd in a neck restraint by a police officer, there is controversy about the use of force by police responding to both violent and peaceful protests. US civil-rights groups have [criticized](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/aggressive-policing-tactics-called-question-national-protests-flare-n1220471) the degree of force used to disperse protesters, which Amnesty International calls ["militarized"](https://www.amnesty.org.uk/press-releases/usa-police-must-end-excessive-militarised-response-george-floyd-protests), while [news companies](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/05/31/george-floyd-protests-stop-attacking-journalists-we-have-job-do/5300346002/) and [press-freedom groups](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-minneapolis-police-protests-press-idUSKBN2370T5) have expressed concern about "targeted attacks" by police against journalists reporting on the protests. On the other hand, after [police SUVs drove into a crowd of protesters](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/new-york-mayor-bill-de-blasio-defends-police-after-video-n1220246) in New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio defended the officers and blamed the protesters for surrounding the vehicles and threatening them, and Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said in a [public statement to NYPD members](https://twitter.com/NYPDShea/status/1267074838436425729) that he is "extremely proud" of the way they have responded to the situation. President Donald Trump and Attorney General Bill Barr [urged](https://apnews.com/b3817623ef861818803b5676d43741ea) governors to increase the use of force.  What kinds of policies and regulations govern how the police may respond to protests? Who sets them and who enforces them? How does the appropriate degree of force depend on the degree to which protesters are violent, damaging private property, or armed with deadly weapons? And are there specific rules about how police should subdue and disperse journalists as opposed to protesters?
What is the process involved in dismissing a law enforcement officer for misconduct?  Minnesota Chiefs of Police Karl Skoogman made the following comment in a Fox News interview yesterday. But didn't have a chance to elaborate more.  > Skoogman also called on reform to the arbitration process for dismissal of police officers. “We have officers that violate public policy, they have a pattern of doing that, and chiefs and sheriffs try to fire them and our courts reinstate those jobs,” he said.   What is involved in dismissing a law enforcement officer and how can the courts reinstate someones job after the fact?

Reports suggest that police use of lethal force against minorities in the U.S. is higher than their white counterpart; and so is the rate of lethal force when compared to police forces in other countries. What policies, both federal and local, have been pursued to try and reduce this number? T[his article by the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/28/opinion/minneapolis-police-brutality.html) goes deep into the issue of how the use of lethal force by the police in the U.S. still persists, particularly against minorities.  &#x200B;  While the conclusion is still being examined, [there is evidence that suggests that rates of use of lethal force by the police in the U.S. are much higher than the rest of the world](https://theconversation.com/why-do-american-cops-kill-so-many-compared-to-european-cops-49696) and [the number of incidents where the ](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/09/the-counted-police-killings-us-vs-other-countries)[police force was involved is significantly larger in America](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/09/the-counted-police-killings-us-vs-other-countries) than in the rest of the world  &#x200B;  One possible change that was discussed was [when Obama called for changes in policing in 2015](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/03/us/politics/obama-calls-for-changes-in-policing-after-task-force-report.html).  However, the rate of police lethal force against minorities is still very prevalent as quoted in [this study](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/34/16793.short) "for young men of color, police use of force is among the leading causes of death" and the persistent prevalence of use of lethal force by the police against minorities is claimed to be [racially motivated](https://www.law.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Paper-Obasogie.pdf). In contrast, [according to this study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6080222/) that examined police lethal force from 2009 to 2012, a large quantity of deaths by lethal force has occurred and at least 50% of the victims were white.  &#x200B;  What other policies, local and federal, have been pursued? How successful have they been?   What policy reasons have been given as to why lethal force from police is so prevalent in the U.S. compared to other countries?
What are the jurisdictional relationships between the local police departments and many federal agencies in and around Washington, D.C.? After [protesting](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/george-floyd-protest-white-house-president-trump-secret-service/) broke out around the White House recently, President Trump tweeted (in part):   >On the bad side, the D.C. Mayor, @MurielBowser, who is always looking for money & help, wouldn't let the D.C. Police get involved. 'Not their job.'  Tweet quoted from the [same article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/george-floyd-protest-white-house-president-trump-secret-service/)   According to the District of Columbia Home Rule Act [here](http://www.abfa.com/ogc/tit7.htm#740), the President may, in emergency situations, direct the MPD to "provide...services of the Metropolitan Police force". I have not seen any discussion of such an emergency declaration being made on or around May 29, the night President Trump referred to in his tweet. And in a broader sense, how are jurisdictional issues between the local PDs and Federal Agencies (the Park Service, the Secret Service, etc.) resolved and navigated?
What are the pros and cons of basing eligibility for social security on life expectancy? Current SS benefits eligibility starts at 62, with greater amounts if you don't take until later. In it's current form, many individuals may be getting the short end of the stick in social security by never reaping benefits or reaping it for much fewer years than average. Conversely, some people may get benefits for 40+ years. These discrepancies can be seen not just individually but also in demographics when broken down by race and gender:  https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr63/nvsr63_03.pdf - White and hispanic women live about a decade longer than black men  http://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/alfresco/publication-pdfs/412943-Has-Social-Security-Redistributed-to-Whites-from-People-of-Color-.PDF - Money is being distributed from PoC to whites  https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v62n2/v62n2p59.pdf - "Minorities and Social Security: An Analysis of Racial and Ethnic Differences in the Current Program"  These individual and demographic discrepancies could be mitigated by attributing life expectancy (as in years left to live, not as in expected age of death) as triggers for social security benefits, or taken into consideration along with age for social security eligibility. Here is a table of life expectancy for Americans based on age and sex, for an example of what I mean (much more than age and sex could be taken into consideration): https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html  Disregarding how life expectancy would be calculated, what are the pros and cons of basing eligibility for social security on life expectancy rather than age?  How could such a plan be implemented given existing political mechanisms? What constitutional and legislative barriers are there?
What have been some successful attempts to legally restrict personal liberty in favor of public safety? In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, some state/local governments and businesses have [mandated facial covering](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/20/us/states-that-require-masks-trnd/index.html) in public. The [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html) has also recommended wearing a mask to [slow the spread of COVID-19](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200403132345.htm). But there are some [controversies](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/think-act-be/202005/why-are-masks-triggering-conflict-and-rage) around this issue. I am curious about the following two questions.  * What have been some successful attempts (legislations, court cases, executive orders) to legally restrict personal liberty in favor of public safety? * How are these historically successful attempts similar or different from the mask debate today? Did people react to these restrictions the same way?
What is the evidence for and against China being a competitor and/or threat to U.S. power? I know very little of global politics and can only understand from the bits and pieces that I read from history about how China came into being as a superpower.  For multiple times, I was exposed to this idea that China [is slowly growing in power since the Cold War and is being seen as the replacement of the USSR](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330543467_Study_on_the_rise_of_China_as_a_dangerous_superpower) and as a threat against the U.S. - the superpower that wants [to compete against the U.S.](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/02/us-china-allies-competition/606637/) or the Western world in general, whether it is  * politically (like the [unlimited terms of the Chinese president](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-43361276) and has a [social score system](https://www.businessinsider.com/china-social-credit-system-punishments-and-rewards-explained-2018-4#a-prototype-blacklist-already-exists-and-has-been-used-to-punish-people-8) which can potentially be a tool for a fascist movement including other questionable actions such as [re-education camps for Muslims in China](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-50511063) and [censorship in China](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/media-censorship-china) ), * militarily (because of [its growing military](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/chinas-modernizing-military)) * or economically (becuase of its growing economic projects such as [the development of the silk road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_and_Road_Initiative) and even a maritime trade route which can be seen as the second silk road and [the economic interests in Africa](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/081315/3-reasons-why-chinese-invest-africa.asp))  &#x200B;  Is there any substantial evidence to support the claim that China can be seen as a threat by the U.S. or even the Western world in general, or can be seen as a threat in the near future?  Or are there any evidence that does not support this claim despite the ongoing growth in China as a superpower?
How did the 1994 Crime Bill affect black/minority communities? I've recently seen a lot of news about [Joe Biden's history of enacted bills and the subsequent affect that had on communities](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/20/18677998/joe-biden-1994-crime-bill-law-mass-incarceration).   So I was wondering the following:  * What data do we have that the crime bill was a positive/negative? * How did the 1994 crime bill affect black/minority communities?
When US government officials say they are “looking at the data” to end lockdown, what data are they referring to? Is there a centralized source when government officials in the US say they are looking at the data in order to reopen businesses?   Is it the CDC? WHO? Are they looking at deaths per day? Mortality rate? What is “the data”?  For example:  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.marinij.com/2020/05/19/marin-pandemic-managers-outline-cautious-business-reopening/amp/
What specific crimes, misdeeds or improprieties are alleged to have been committed under the "Obamagate" moniker and what evidence is there to support or oppose those allegations? Hello.  There have been various news articles recently about a supposed scandal referred to as "Obamagate," which seems to have something to do with events that took place back in 2016. Here are some examples:  1) Example of a piece mostly putting this into the context of original Obama-Trump conflict, the birther episode: https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/05/obamagate-birtherism-all-over-again/611692/  2) Another piece, which dismisses the proposed scandal immediately (paywall warning): https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-absurd-cynicism-of-obamagate/2020/05/15/03464e0a-96ea-11ea-9f5e-56d8239bf9ad_story.html  3) This piece makes Obamagate sound like a really serious scandal. While it does not conflict with the others on the main facts, it spins the same thing very differently. Essentially, the "unmasking" considered routine in the other sources is apparently not routine at all: https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/fred-fleitz-obamagate-how-obama-administration-apparently-weaponized-intel-agencies-for-political-attacks  I would like to know:  i) What crime (official lawful infraction) is Obama alleged to have committed and what is the evidence supporting or opposing that allegation?  ii) Aside from legality/illegality, what is alleged to be improper about what Obama did?  iii) What statements have been made arguing that Obama's actions were or weren't immoral?  iv) Is this an issue that came out this week, or is it a new narrative based on publicly known information?  v) Aside from embarking on an ambitious research project to find truth every time something happens, is there any way to actually know what is happening during stories like this? Are there go-to sources that can be universally trusted when it comes to deciphering alleged political scandals?  Thank you to all those who take the time and effort to comment thoughtfully.
What are the legal differences between the Pennsylvania lockdown that SCOTUS supported and the Wisconsin lockdown that their state Supreme Court struck down? Here's the situation I'm curious about:  On May 8, 2020, Governor Tom Wolf was sued by several businesses that essentially argued the following:  > The Pennsylvania businesses argued Wolf's lockdown order was unconstitutional and filed an emergency request with the Pennsylvania Supreme Court arguing it went beyond Wolf's authority.  The Supreme Court [unanimously declined to lift the order](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-pennsylvania-stay-at-home-order-businesses/)  [Copy of the Supreme Court opinion](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/19/19A1032/142444/20200427121304104_APPLICATION%20FOR%20STAY.pdf)  Fast forward to today, [Wisconsin's Supreme Court just ruled that Governor Tony Evers' stay-at-home extension was unconstitutional.](https://www.nbc15.com/content/news/Wisconsin-Supreme-Court-blocks-Evers-stay-home-extension-570448161.html)  In light of the recent Supreme Court decision, I have a lot of questions about these cases because I'm admittedly not an expert on the legal surroundings of either, but I'm curious how the results can be different.  1. Are these cases arguing two different things, which is why the courts came to different conclusions?  2. What *are* the differences between these cases, or is this something that will be appealed up to the Supreme Court and ultimately the same ruling will apply?
Can independently produced content be an in-kind campaign contribution subject to FEC rules if reposted by a candidate? At 11:28 AM May 9, 2020 \[presumably my timezone of CST\], President Trump [posted this video](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1259158370390544384) on Twitter. It is not a retweet, but acknowledges thebradfordfile as the source.  At  6:55 PM May 9, 2020, [thebradfordfile Twitter account](https://twitter.com/thebradfordfile/status/1259270843290587137) acknowledges "I made this video...".

What are the basis and implications of the US Department of Justice's decision to withdraw its prosecution of Michael Flynn? In December 2017, Michael Flynn, who served as US President Donald Trump's first National Security Advisor, [pleaded guilty to a federal criminal charge](https://www.cnn.com/2017/12/01/politics/michael-flynn-charged/index.html) for lying to investigators to conceal unauthorized conversations he had with the Russian ambassador before Trump took office. This guilty plea was part of a deal with the Mueller probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election, and the deal also included Flynn's cooperation with that investigation, a decision not to prosecute Flynn's [potentially illegal work as a paid lobbyist of the Turkish government](https://web.archive.org/web/20170308234613/http://www.bigstory.ap.org/article/former-trump-security-adviser-flynn-admits-turkey-lobbying) while advising the Trump campaign, and a [decision not to prosecute Flynn's son](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/michael-flynn-charged-with-making-false-statement-to-the-fbi/2017/12/01/e03a6c48-d6a2-11e7-9461-ba77d604373d_story.html).  Today, one of the federal prosecutors on the case [formally requested dismissal of Flynn's criminal charge](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/white-collar-and-criminal-law/justice-department-drops-charges-against-ex-trump-aide-flynn), on the grounds that the FBI investigation had no legitimate basis and interviewers knowingly let Flynn lie to them so he could be charged for the lying. This concedes to an argument by Flynn's defense, [who accused the Department of Justice of malfeasance and moved to withdraw his previous guilty plea](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/01/14/michael-flynn-guilty-plea-withdraw-099021).   1. Does the Department of Justice's previous behavior in the Flynn case violate specific laws or ethical guidelines? * How often do prosecutors drop a case in which the defendant has already pleaded guilty? * [Politico notes](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/07/top-prosecutor-in-flynn-case-abruptly-withdraws-amid-trump-attacks-243107) that dismissal of the case requires the judge's approval but "it would be extraordinary for a judge to order prosecutors to proceed with a case they are seeking to drop"; is there any extraordinary basis for the judge to decline dismissal in this situation? * If the plea deal is no longer in effect, are the Flynns' other potential crimes still open to future charges from federal or state prosecutors, and if so can the evidence and guilty plea from the aborted federal prosecution be used against them? * Does the prosecution's admission of FBI misconduct create a basis for Flynn to sue the Department of Justice? * Does the prosecution's filing create a precedent that can be cited by other criminal defendants who accuse their investigators of misconduct?
Historical discussion of 25th Amend. Section 4 The [25th Amendment to the Constitution Section 4](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxxv) states:  >Whenever  the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of  the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law  provide, transmit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the  Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that  the President is unable to discharge the  powers and duties of his  office, the Vice President shall immediately  assume the powers and  duties of the office as Acting President.Thereafter, when the  President transmits to the President pro tempore  of the Senate and the  Speaker of the House of Representatives his  written declaration that no  inability exists, he shall resume the powers  and duties of his office  unless the Vice President and a majority of either the principal  officers of the executive department or of such other body as Congress  may by law provide, transmit within four days to the President pro  tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of  Representatives  their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the  powers and duties of his office. Thereupon Congress shall decide the  issue, assembling within forty-eight hours for that purpose if not in  session. If the Congress, within twenty-one days after receipt of the  latter written declaration, or, if Congress is not in session, within  twenty-one days after Congress is required to assemble, determines by  two-thirds vote of both Houses that the President is  unable to  discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall  continue to discharge the same as Acting President; otherwise, the  President shall resume the powers and duties of his  office.  Are there documented examples of Section 4 being invoked or considered since its ratification in 1967?  What discussion occurred in Congress around the time this was debated  that would speak to what circumstances justify a declaration the  President is "unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office".   Are  there known examples of Congress overriding the President's written declaration within Section 4? If not, are there any examples of similar  state-level actions? If the President were to submit a written declaration and Congress were to override their return to office, leaving the VP as acting President, does the President have standing to sue? Is there legal precedent to support his doing so?
Can the Democratic Party replace Joe Biden as its nominee for the presidential election? [Joe Biden is the Democratic Party's presumptive nominee for the presidential race and other major candidates have already suspended their campaigns](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2020-presidential-delegates-tracker/), but the national convention where the nominee will be officially chosen is still [three months away](https://www.wisn.com/article/dnc-convention-delayed-to-august-due-to-coronavirus/32018109). In light of [a developing controversy about a sexual assault allegation against Biden](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/woman-broadens-claims-against-biden-include-sexual-assault-n1182296), Elizabeth Bruenig [writes in the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/03/opinion/joe-biden-tara-reade.html) that Democrats need to "consider a plan B":  > I have my own impressions regarding Ms. Reade’s allegations, but no one — save Ms. Reade and Mr. Biden — knows with certainty whether her claims are true. What I can assert with firm conviction is that Democrats ought to start considering a backup plan for 2020.   If Democrats do change their minds and no longer think Biden is their strongest candidate for the November election, this raises several questions about their other options:  * Procedurally, how would it work? If Biden withdraws, does the nomination automatically go to the runner-up (currently Bernie Sanders), or are the delegates pledged to Biden reassigned in some way? * If Biden doesn't choose to withdraw voluntarily, can the party disqualify him anyway, within its current rules? * If Biden receives the nomination and names a running mate, but he departs the race before Election Day, can he still be replaced or is his former running mate then the effective presidential candidate? * How much leverage the remaining state primary elections hold if Democratic voters quickly change their mind about Biden? * What is the timeline of when certain options become impossible for the Democratic Party?  ---  late EDIT: my previous phrasing was incorrect because the other candidates have [suspended their campaigns but not officially withdrawn](https://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/04/10/what-does-suspending-mean-2/), so Biden could theoretically withdraw in a more real sense than his former rivals have done, which might have implications for party procedure
Is there a policy difference between protecting a public health service and protecting the general public health? Although this question doesn't apply exclusively to the United States, it's written from a US perspective on individual rights and the role of government.  In most jurisdictions, the justification for strict [lockdowns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curfews_and_lockdowns_related_to_the_COVID-19_pandemic) and [stay-at-home orders](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/23/us/coronavirus-which-states-stay-at-home-order-trnd/index.html) was to slow the spread of Covid-19 in order to avoid overwhelming their healthcare systems. The [stated goal](https://www.asisonline.org/security-management-magazine/latest-news/today-in-security/2020/march/Officials-and-Executives-Mandate-Closures-to-Flatten-the-Curve/) was to ["flatten the curve,"](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/13/815502262/flattening-a-pandemics-curve-why-staying-home-now-can-save-lives) so that even if many people got sick, they wouldn't all get sick at once, thereby keeping the total cases at any one time within the capacity of area hospitals. [People largely accepted this](https://thehill.com/changing-america/well-being/prevention-cures/489535-poll-majority-of-voters-support-national) goal as a reasonable justification for the curtailing of their freedoms of movement and association.   Now, as leaders are considering reopening their economies, the issue is not usually framed as a method of preserving *systems,* but rather as a [balance between reviving the economy and saving *lives.*](https://www.npr.org/2020/05/02/849643030/balancing-public-safety-and-reopening-economies)   So, I'm wondering if the goals have shifted from protecting a public health service to protecting the general public health, or if those are functionally the same. The US Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that the state has [no duty to protect individual lives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeShaney_v._Winnebago_County#Court_opinion) and, as much as it's something we largely value, it wasn't strictly the original goal.   If citizens accepted the restrictions in order to ensure that those of us who showed up to a hospital could get treated, does it automatically follow that we now accept it is the government's responsibility to broadly protect individual lives? And if the goal is now to protect the general health instead of protecting healthcare systems, would it be appropriate to impose strong restrictions like this to address other threats to public health?
Do states typically have to guard supplies from the federal government? What is being done with the seized supplies? > [Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) said Thursday that thousands of coronavirus tests obtained by the state from South Korea are currently protected in an undisclosed location by the Maryland National Guard.](https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/495519-maryland-governor-says-coronavirus-tests-acquired-from-south-korea-under) >  > Asked in a Washington Post Live interview whether he was concerned the federal government would seize the tests, Hogan acknowledged “it was a little bit of a concern.”  ...  > Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker (R) had a purchase of 3 million N95 masks confiscated by an unspecified federal agency at the Port of New York in March just as the state was in the process of acquiring another 1.2 million from China.  >  > Baker ultimately relied on a private jet owned by the New England Patriots to transport the other 1.2 million masks that he purchased from China to Boston.  >  > Two weeks later, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D) arranged for two charter flights to transport millions of masks and gloves from China to Illinois, intentionally keeping the details of the flights secret from the Trump administration to avoid confiscation. >  > “It is true that the federal government seems to be interrupting supplies that are being sent elsewhere in the nation, and so I wanted to make sure that we received what we ordered,” Pritzker told reporters at an April 15 press conference.  &nbsp;  * Do states typically have to protect supplies from seizure by the federal government? * Are there other examples of federal seizure of state goods during other emergencies? * What is being done with the seized supplies?
Is it legally possible to ban international graduate students from learning STEM subjects? Senator Tom Cotton recently suggested in a tweet that Chinese students should not be allowed to study STEM in the United States.   [Tweet Link](https://twitter.com/SenTomCotton/status/1254802112195805187)  A [Bloomberg Report](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-26/gop-senator-says-don-t-let-chinese-students-study-stem-in-u-s) quoted: “The students should be allowed ‘to come here and study Shakespeare and the Federalist Papers, that’s what they need to learn from America,’ he said. ‘They don’t need to learn quantum computing and artificial intelligence from America.’ Previous travel bans include [executive order 13780](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/03/09/2017-04837/protecting-the-nation-from-foreign-terrorist-entry-into-the-united-states), also known as the “Trump Travel Ban”.    My question is: does the law allow the aforesaid intended actions to be actually taken place?
What specific actions can the USDA now take to ensure meat production facilities remain open after the DPA executive order? [The White House has issued an Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-delegating-authority-dpa-respect-food-supply-chain-resources-national-emergency-caused-outbreak-covid-19/) relating to meat and poultry.  The stated goal of the order is to ensure that meat processing facilities remain open.  They have done so based on the [Defense Production Act](https://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/20130726-1650-20490-5258/final__defense_production_act_091030.pdf), specifically, section 101 and 101(b).  This was [previously used in relation to medical supplies](https://www.lawfareblog.com/whats-trumps-executive-order-defense-production-act) in March; then it was [used to try to ramp up production of medical supplies](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/03/coronavirus-trump-used-defense-production-act-on-these-companies-so-far.html), but not specifically in order to prevent closure of businesses.  The meat and poultry DPA order allows the government to make use of the [USDA's Priorities and Allocations procedures](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2016-title7-vol7/pdf/CFR-2016-title7-vol7-part789.pdf).  What specific powers and processes does designating food products as critical infrastructure grant the federal government?  1. Can the government begin ordering meat via a [rated order](https://www.fema.gov/information-contractors-about-priority-rated-orders)? 2. Can the government force plants to reopen that had voluntarily closed? 3. Can the government prevent a plant from closing due to a worker shortage or safety issue? 4. Can the DPA override state and local laws regarding pandemic procedures?  An earlier [discussion relating to social distancing here argues not](https://www.lawfareblog.com/can-federal-government-override-state-government-rules-social-distancing-promote-economy), but it is not exactly the same scenario.  Additionally, does the [liability provision in DPA](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/4557) automatically shield any meat processing companies from liability if they endanger workers by exposing them to unnecessary risk of infection?  [Liability protection is one of the claimed goals.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/04/28/trump-meat-plants-dpa/)
The US Treasury is the arbiter of whether airlines receiving taxpayer funds can cancel routes between cities. Airlines have (mostly unsuccessfully) been petitioning the Treasury to temporarily halt flying certain routes. How is the Treasury justifying whether airlines should maintain flying or not? As part of the recent payroll bailout package for airlines, [carriers must maintain a minimum level of service between locations](https://news.trust.org/item/20200428150116-lprmu):  > The airlines must maintain minimum service levels in exchange for getting cash grants from the U.S. Treasury to assist in payroll costs unless the department issues a waiver.  With a 95% drop in customer demand, airlines are seeking to cut these routes anyway, and are now petitioning the US Treasury to temporarily suspend certain routes:  > JetBlue wants to halt flights to 16 U.S. airports...  > Delta wants to suspend flights to nine airports...  > Spirit Airlines Inc asked the department for approval to suspend flights to [seven locations]....  Many of these petitions have been denied, but some have been granted:  > Earlier this month, the department rejected most of Spirit's requests to halt flights...  > The department earlier also required JetBlue to keep flying to nine destinations...  > Frontier asked approval to suspend service to 33 U.S. locations... ...the department approved just three requests...  > The department also said it had approved Cape Air's request to halt flights to New York...  Airlines have said that they would like to scale up with customer demand, instead of being forced to fly routes with few flyers:  > JetBlue said it "fully intends to gradually resume service to the levels prescribed (by the Transportation Department) at each of these airports as soon as it is both safe to do so and when even the slightest customer demand re-emerges."  ---  1. Under the grant package, how is the US Treasury deciding whether airlines must maintain flying between certain locations? What is the basis for these decisions?  2. In normal circumstance, how much autonomy do US air carriers have in deciding how often and where to fly to? Was there any previous regulation mandating carriers maintain routes?
What happens , step-by-step, to the money for loans "returned" to the government? For examples: Harvard [returned its loan money](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/22/harvard-rejects-trump-call-to-return-stimulus-grant). Shake Shack [returned its loan money](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/20/838439215/shake-shack-returns-10-million-loan-to-u-s-program-for-small-businesses).   What does "return" in this context actually mean? What do the processes entail, line-by-line, step-by-step? Use credible sources please.
The history of State bankruptcy in the United States? Recently, Senator Mitch McConnell suggested that instead of Federal aid, he would favor ["allowing States to use the bankruptcy route"](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-22/mcconnell-says-he-favors-allowing-states-to-declare-bankruptcy?sref=Ktl4bRS0) to address financial struggles due to high public employee pension costs. However, while [cities have declared bankruptcy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_bankruptcy) there is no historical precedent for States having access to bankruptcy and under current law, States [cannot declare bankruptcy](https://www.politifact.com/article/2020/apr/24/can-states-file-bankruptcy-should-they-what-you-ne/).    * How have States resolved serious financial crises?  * What mechanisms of action are available to States as an alternative to bankruptcy? * Have Federal State bankruptcy laws ever been proposed? How do they differ than municipal bankruptcy laws?     Thanks to /u/BaconIpsumDolor for allowing a rework of their original question.
What current mechanisms and powers, if any, do countries such as the U.S. have in place to demand reparations from other countries? The U.S. has recently announced an investigation into the origins of COVID-19 with a theory of it being released by the Chinese Government, even though top U.S. officials and scientists have said that it was most likely all natural.  Republican Congressman Jim Banks and Lindsay Graham have said that Trump should force China to forgive U.S. debt as reperations over coronavirus,and saying the "China must pay big time", respectfully.  Boris Johnson was reportedly told to seize Chinese property and assets as colleteral, and German tabloid Bild has put together a £130 Billion invoice directed at China.  So what, if any, powers and mechanisms are in place that, should specific nations wish to demand reparations or punish another nation, currently exist?  Do international bodies such as the United Nations or the International Criminal Court have powers or means to hold a nation responsible? If so, is there any legal ability to enforce these demands?  Have there been any previous examples of nations being demanded to pay reparations over mishandling of a natural/man-made disaster? If so, what were the results?       source being:   1- https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-trump-china/trump-says-us-investigating-whether-virus-came-from-wuhan-lab-idUSKCN21Y01B  1- https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/republican-congressman-calls-on-trump-to-make-china-forgive-us-debt-over-coronavirus-crisis  2- https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1266479/coronavirus-UK-latest-china-pay-reparations-debt-beijing-owned-bank-assets-London  3- https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1271028/Angela-Merkel-Germany-China-coronavirus-blame-Wuhan-Xi-Jinping-Trump-latest
Is requiring face masks outdoors and in public spaces constitutional (U.S.)?    Some cities are starting to require face masks while outdoors.  Is this constitutional in the United States?

Are there any documented cases of gun laws positively or negatively affecting gun homicides? For the sake of this discussion, let's go with USA gun laws.  This study right here is something I found on Wikipedia regarding the Brady Gun Bill signed by Bill Clinton in 1993. It concluded that the bill reduced gun suicides for people above 55 but had no affect on homicides. https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/192946  Donald Trump claimed Chicago has the most stringent gun laws in the nation, has one of the worst murder rates in the nation.

How effective have the World Health Organization's policies been in meeting its mission? The [mission statement of the WHO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization#Overall_focus ) is "the attainment by all people of the highest possible level of health".    > The WHO's broad mandate includes advocating for universal healthcare, monitoring public health risks, coordinating responses to health emergencies, and promoting human health and well being. It provides technical assistance to countries, sets international health standards and guidelines, and collects data on global health issues through the World Health Survey. Its flagship publication, the World Health Report, provides expert assessments of global health topics and health statistics on all nations. The WHO also serves as a forum for summits and discussions on health issues.   The WHO is governed by the [World Health Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Assembly), which is comprised of voting representatives from [194 member states](https://www.who.int/countries/en/).   [Recently, President Trump has announced the ending of United States funding towards the World Health Organization](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52289056?at_custom2=twitter&at_custom3=%40BBCWorld&at_custom4=59AEF074-7EA0-11EA-9D69-DB8B4744363C&at_custom1=%5Bpost+type%5D&at_medium=custom7&at_campaign=64), with the rationale that the WHO's policies have not been effective in combating the current coronavirus pandemic, particularly with [efforts by WHO that some have viewed as acquiescing to China efforts to downplay China's role in the coronavirus pandemic](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/04/08/who-china-trump-coronavirus-176242).   [In the past, the WHO has also come under criticism for its response to other disease outbreaks, most notably the recent 2014 Ebola outbreak](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-34877787), in which the WHO was accused of responding too slowly.   How effective have the WHO's policies been in meeting its stated mission?
What actually happens if the USPS gets privatized? The USPS recent warned congress that [it could become insolvent amid coronavirus](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/10/politics/postal-service-congress-help/index.html). There have been reports that the government has been slow moving on this, specifically as it relates to [mail-in voting](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/us/politics/republicans-vote-by-mail.html). Donald trump now [reportedly said he would reject a bailout package if it included aid to keep the US Postal Service functioning](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-rejects-bailout-that-included-aid-to-usps-report-says-2020-4). This has got people talking about [the possibility of the US Postal Service being privatized](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/trumps-privatization-plan-would-destroy-the-postal-service/2018/08/07/caaf9a24-99a2-11e8-8d5e-c6c594024954_story.html).  1) How does the privatization actually work and what are the benefits and downsides of privatizing the USPS?    2) How would it affect the USPS itself?   3) How would it affect ordinary people like myself?         I'm asking because I'm trying to understand the mechanics and scope of this thing.
Up to today, what characteristics do countries with effective COVID-19 containment strategies have versus those that have struggled? This is obviously difficult to nail down completely empirically, as some countries like South Korea [did mass testing of the population](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/03/23/coronavirus-pandemic-south-korea-italy-mass-testing-covid19-will-keep-spreading/), finding many asymptomatic carriers of coronavirus. Many places may have had [people who had the disease](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/05/have-i-already-had-coronavirus-how-would-i-know) earlier but were never identified as positive. Also many countries have perhaps engaged in practices to avoid the stigma of high death counts. Previous cases of death from influenza and pneumonia are now [perhaps undiagnosed COVID-19](https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/04/cdc-launches-studies-to-get-more-precise-count-of-undetected-covid-19-cases/) cases. And obviously, inequality plays a role in the numbers. Countries with low testing capacity will have low numbers of formally identified cases, but that does not mean low levels of COVID-19 cases and coronavirus characters.  But, to this point (rather than speculating about the future), what empirically has worked in reducing cases and deaths? New Zealand has [five million people and about a thousand cases](https://www.forbes.com/sites/erinspencer1/2020/04/10/new-zealands-pm-is-leading-a-masterclass-on-coronavirus-response/#5883ea865793), but deaths are in the single digits. Taiwan's response to coronavirus has been so competent that there are now [calls for it to join the WHO](https://www.yahoo.com/news/taiwans-coronavirus-success-bolsters-case-150420811.html), which like many international bodies it is not a member due to the ongoing One China dispute with Mainland China.    The U.S, Italy, France, and Spain have all had huge issues keeping cases below the capacity of the healthcare system. According to [one projection of the US](https://covidactnow.org/), many states and counties are at risk of overwhelming hospitals within the next month or two, unless social distancing and stay at home measures are more rigorously enforced. Italy faced issues with an aging population and an abnormally high death rate.  A final factor is the issue of second waves and the return of the infection given that international travel will eventually begin to open again. Singapore, which isolated and avoided community transmission, [now has new clusters](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/09/world/asia/coronavirus-hong-kong-singapore-taiwan.html) due to travelers who were not identified as having the virus. That article also gives another opinion on Taiwan's efforts, showing the importance of looking at containment as something that takes months, rather than a few weeks. COVID-19 can take a while to kill after initial infection, with recovery taking weeks if not months. Here is an [excerpt from an NPR story on it](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/02/14/805289669/how-covid-19-kills-the-new-coronavirus-disease-can-take-a-deadly-turn):  > The most severe cases — about 6% of patients — end up in intensive care with multi-organ failure, respiratory failure and septic shock, according to a February report from the WHO. And many hospitalized patients require supplemental oxygen. In extreme cases, they need mechanical ventilation — including the use of a sophisticated technology known as ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation), which basically acts as the patient's lungs, adding oxygen to their blood and removing carbon dioxide. The technology "allows us to save more severe patients," Dr. Sylvie Briand, director of the WHO's pandemic and epidemic diseases department, said at a press conference In February. >  > Many of the more serious cases have been in people who are middle-aged and elderly — Furuya notes that our immune system gets weaker as we age. She says for long-term smokers, it could be even worse because their airways and lungs are more vulnerable. People with other underlying medical conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes or chronic lung disease, have also proved most vulnerable. Furuya says those kinds of conditions can make it harder for the body to recover from infections. >  > "Of course, you have outliers — people who are young and otherwise previously healthy who are dying," Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told NPR's 1A show. "But if you look at the vast majority of the people who have serious disease and who will ultimately die, they are in that group that are either elderly and/or have underlying conditions." >  > Estimates for the case fatality rate for COVID-19 vary depending on the country. But data from both China and Lombardy, Italy, show the fatality rate starts rising for people in their 60s. In Lombardy, for instance, the case fatality rate for those in their 60s is nearly 3 percent. It's nearly 10 percent for people in their 70s and more than 16 percent for those in their 80s.  So, what has worked, what has not?
What are the advantages and disadvantages of unconditionally allowing people to vote by mail? In light of social-distancing necessities for the ongoing global pandemic, some in the US are [now calling](https://time.com/5808041/coronavirus-vote-by-mail/) for more states to allow citizens to vote in elections by mailing in their ballots instead of going to a polling place, without requiring a valid excuse why they're unable to go to a polling place like absentee voting. What advantages does unconditional voting by mail bring, and at what cost?  More specifically,  * Even without a virus to worry about, are there groups of people who are inherently more likely to vote if they can do it by mail than if they have to go to a polling place? * Does voting by mail pose a greater risk of voting fraud? * Are there any estimates of the short-run cost and time to switch to the new system, or the long-run cost of operating that way? * What are the results in places that have already adopted unconditional voting by mail, or those that have 100% voting by mail and no polling places at all?
New York Mayor Bill DeBlasio has called for a national draft of civilian doctors to help the areas hardest hit by COVID-19, like New York City. Is there any legal basis for such an idea? The [New York Times reports](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/nyregion/coronavirus-new-york-update.html) :  >Mayor Bill de Blasio called Thursday night for doctors and other medical  workers across the country to be drafted and sent to the places where  coronavirus has hit hardest — starting in New York.  The  Selective Service system is the existing mechanism for a military draft in the United States. It [currently specifies a random lottery of men between the ages of 20-25](https://www.sss.gov/about/return-to-draft/lottery/).  Is there a legal basis for the President to unilaterally modify these criteria to call on people in specific professions and ignore the gender and age requirements? If not, does the Constitution allow Congress to pass a new draft law that would? Is there any other legal mechanism available to the President outside of military use of the Selective Service that would enable these actions?  &#x200B;
Can the Trump Campaign actually stop TV networks from airing ads that are critical of the President's response to the COVID-19 outbreak? On the 25th of March, several news outlets reported that President Donald J. Trump's re-election campaign sent cease and desist letters to TV stations in five ["battleground" states.](https://apnews.com/5251611364ef032adb1de2d467f15726) The [letter](https://assets.donaldjtrump.com/2017/web/hero_images/Redacted_PUSA_Letter.pdf) stated that an [advert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkMwvmJLnc0&feature=emb_title) paid for by the Super PAC "Priorities USA":  > ...stitched together fragments from multiple speeches by President Trump to fraudulently and maliciously imply that President Trump called the coronavirus outbreak a “hoax.” As fully set forth in the enclosed facts sheet, and President Trump’s full quote below, the facts show beyond reasonable doubt that he was talking about the Democrat’s politicization of the outbreak when he used the word “hoax.”   [Snopes](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-coronavirus-rally-remark/) gives the claim that Trump called the virus a hoax a "Mixture" rating on its fact checker, citing that whilst this language was used, he did not directly refer to the virus as being a hoax.  The letter then goes on to threaten legal action, claiming that:  >PUSA does not have a “right to command the use of broadcast facilities.” CBS v. DNC, 412 U.S. 94, 113 (1973). Your station therefore bears responsibility for the ad’s content. See Felix v. Westinghouse Radio Stations, 186 F.2d 1, 6 (3d Cir. 1950). In addition, your station has a responsibility to “protect the public from false, misleading or deceptive advertising,” Licensee Responsibility With Respect to the Broadcast of False, Misleading or Deceptive Advertising, 74 F.C.C.2d 623 (1961), and your failure to remove this deceptive ad may be “probative of an underlying abdication of licensee responsibility” that could put your station’s license in jeopardy. Cosmopolitan Broadcasting Corporation v. FCC, 581 F.2d 917, 927 (1978).   The letter concludes by saying:  >Given the foregoing, should you fail to immediately cease broadcasting PUSA’s ad “Exponential Threat”, Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. will have no choice but to pursue all legal remedies available to it in law and in equity; we will not stand idly by and allow you to broadcast false, deceptive, and misleading information concerning President’s Trump’s healthcare positions without consequence.   Bloomberg News has run an article on this letter titled ["Trump Campaign’s Threat on TV Licenses May Be Mostly Bluster"](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-26/trump-campaign-s-threat-on-tv-licenses-may-be-mostly-bluster), in which it states:  >The FCC doesn’t appear to have grounds to act against the stations for airing contentious ads, said Jack Goodman, a Washington broadcast attorney, said in an interview. The ad “is core political speech” protected by First Amendment guarantees of free speech, Goodman said.  The article also quotes Gene Policinski, senior fellow for the First Amendment at the Freedom Forum Institute, who said:  >“This goes back to Nixon in the ‘60s, talking about revoking stations critical to his administration.”   Given that the Trump Campaign seems convinced that stations airing this ad, which the letter states is misleading, can be subjected to legal action, with legal precedents being cited in support of their argument, despite the content of the advert being protected under the 1st Amendment, my question is as follows: Can the Trump Campaign actually stop this advert from being aired?  Thank you.
Where does the US government get the money to fund the CARES act? The US government [recently passed the CARES act](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/25/818881845/senate-reaches-historic-deal-on-2t-coronavirus-economic-rescue-package), which is a 2 trillion dollar stimulus package.

With that, does the President or appropriate Executive Authority, have the legal ability to quarantine an entire state or local area?
Arguments for and against Eurobonds (in particular in light of the current crisis)? [Several European countries, among them France and Italy, have called for "Eurobonds"](https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/nine-member-states-ask-for-eurobonds-to-face-coronavirus-crisis/), meaning a common debt instrument to finance the measures needed to weather pandemic (the letter is linked in the article, on page 3 is the relevant part). In the letter they are talking about how its an "external shock, for which no country bears responsibility", but my question is if issuing a common debt instrument without shared fiscal policy is the best way to solve this problem. This would bring some issues with it, most obvious is [moral hazard](https://www.ft.com/content/e654f96a-15ef-11e1-b4b1-00144feabdc0).   I asked this question in particular because countries have other, more traditional ways they can take on debt. They can issue their own bonds, [whose yields are extremely low for all countries](https://www.bloomberg.com/markets/rates-bonds) thanks to the excess in the markets. Even if they can't find a buyer, [the ECB has announced another round of quantitative easing](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-26/ecb-will-scrap-bond-limits-for-its-pandemic-purchases-program) in form of its PEPP program ([press release by the ECB here](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2020/html/ecb.pr200318_1~3949d6f266.en.html)). And if this is not enough, there is still [the ESM, which could issue loans and offer lines of credit](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/23/corona-bonds-what-they-are-and-why-europe-is-talking-about-them.html). Compared to this, what is the advantage of Eurobonds?
How is the WHO governed, who determines it's official policy, and how have countries around the world responded to the WHO's policies? The WHO is currently [criticizing](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-25/countries-should-stop-wasting-time-and-fight-virus-who-says) countries with strong wording. But there are modern western countries that choose a different approach than immediate lockdown, such as [Sweden](https://www.dw.com/en/coronavirus-no-lockdowns-in-sweden-for-now/a-52904188). And it’s not only a political choice, it’s the [official](https://www.ft.com/content/31de03b8-6dbc-11ea-89df-41bea055720b) stance of Swedish epidemiologists.  So how is the WHO governed, who determines it's official policy, and how have countries around the world responded to the WHO's policies?
Citizens assemblies are randomly sampled groups of citizens that deliberate on issues and are thought of as an alternative to representative democracy. What does the research say about their efficacy? [Citizen assemblies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens%27_assembly) are deliberative bodies formed using [sortition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortition) or random selection. The typical assembly focuses on a single topic where:  1. There is a "Learning Phase" where academics educate the assembly on the topic at hand. 2. There is an "Open Forum Phase" where members of the public, interest groups, and politicians submit comments on the topic at hand. 3. There is a "Discussion Phase" where the assembly deliberates with each other over the merits and demerits of proposals 4. There is a "Decision Phase" where members vote in favor or against the proposals.   There has been a lot written about citizens assemblies over the years.    * They were used to [recommend Single Transferable Voting for British columbia](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0032329206297147). The recommendation was however ignored in the referendum.  * A number of [political scientists have had plenty to write about citizen assemblies](https://cdd.stanford.edu/2019/symposium-james-s-fishkin-democracy-when-the-people-are-thinking/).   * Citizens assemblies have been used in Ireland to build support in [legalizing gay marriage and legalizing abortion](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/16/citizens-assembly-ireland-abortion-referendum). Irish citizen assemblies have also recommended[ carbon taxes on petrochemicals and livestock and dairy production](https://www.citizensassembly.ie/en/how-the-state-can-make-ireland-a-leader-in-tackling-climate-change/recommendations/).   As well as in Ireland and Canada, activists and politicians have called for the use of Citizens Assemblies to tackle issues like Brexit in the UK and climate change in France and Australia.   What arguments and research is there for or against Citizens Assemblies?
How has China handled the economic effects of COVID-19 as it relates to workers, businesses, and markets? Starting in late January, China began to [quarantine millions of its citizens](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/chinas-coronavirus-lockdown-strategy-brutal-but-effective) in hopes of containing the spread of novel coronavirus.  Only now is Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, [beginning to re-open](https://www.foxnews.com/world/china-end-lockdown-coronavirus-hubei-wuhan).  ---  Now, as the [West faces the virus](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-51970379) and enacts various versions of travel restrictions, the negative [economic impacts](https://thehill.com/policy/finance/economy/489174-imf-coronavirus-recession-will-be-as-bad-as-financial-crisis) of the virus have become clear, and the [United States](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/24/politics/congress-vote-coronavirus-economic-stimulus/index.html), as [well](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/20/government-pay-wages-jobs-coronavirus-rishi-sunak) as [many](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/23/coronavirus-europe-germany-unveils-stimulus-italy-tightens-lockdown-as-death-toll-rises.html) other [countries](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/09/italy-wants-more-public-spending-to-fight-coronavirus-amid-lockdown.html), are in various stages of crafting economic packages to help workers, businesses, and markets.  ---  Since China just went through a version of what much of the West is beginning to go tackle, I wanted to ask about a few aspects of China's economic responses to COVID-19.  ---  1. In the short term, how did China handle the economic logistics of millions of citizens not going to work? For example, in the United States many [workers live paycheck to paycheck](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/08/14/paycheck-to-paycheck-most-americans-struggle-financially-survey-says/39940123/). Was this a problem for China? Did it prevent citizens from paying rent, buying groceries?  2. The US financial markets have been [wildly unstable](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/markets/when-will-financial-markets-hit-bottom-past-may-not-hold-n1164966). Did this happen in China? How was it managed?  3. Is there a good idea on the total economic cost to China since travel restrictions were put in place? For example, an assessment of small businesses that might not re-open, such as restaurants and other stores without enough cash buffer to survive a prolonged shutdown?  4. As Wuhan gets back to work, and the rest of China gets back to normal, is there an economic stimulus plan being crafted for the country? What does it looks like?
Since the Senate required 60 votes to the pass the motion to bring the 3rd coronavirus bill to the floor, is there a procedural/process reason for why Sen. Mitch McConnell voted against the motion making it a 47-47 tie? [https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/22/coronavirus-stimulus-congress-141360](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/22/coronavirus-stimulus-congress-141360)  The 3rd coronavirus bill was stopped on 3/22/2020 after the Senate fell short of the 60 votes needed to stop debate and vote on the bill. The bill would have provided relief measures intended to help the American people during the coronavirus crisis. However, Democrats argued that the bill had major flaws, and so unanimously voted against the motion to bring the bill to a full Senate floor vote.  The [motion](https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=116&session=2&vote=00077) was rejected by a 47-47 tie, as it needed a minimum of 60 votes to pass. Mitch McConnell was the only Republican to vote nay on the motion. According to the [video](https://floor.senate.gov/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=2&clip_id=3646) of the Senate proceedings for 3/22/2020, Mr. McConnell's vote happens at roughly 5 hours and 36 minutes into the clip, which happens to be the last vote on the motion. So my question is, are there any procedural/process reasons for making the motion a tie as opposed to being a 48-46?
What are the short, medium, long term stated goals of the Fed's recently announced "Main Street Business Lending Program"? The Fed recently announced what people are calling an "unprecedented" and "aggressive" program to help the economy.  https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-fed/fed-aims-bazooka-to-backstop-coronavirus-hit-economy-idUSKBN21A1U2  Under the new programs, the Fed will lend against student loans, credit card loans, and U.S. government backed-loans to small businesses, and buy bonds of larger employers and make loans to them in what amounts to four years of bridge financing.  I would like a better understanding of the short (1 month), medium (6-12 month), and long term (1 year and beyond) goals and expected impacts. Has the Fed enacted similar programs in the past? If so, what were their short, medium and long term impacts?
With US public debt set to quickly rise from the Covid-19 pandemic, what are some possible effects of the US rapidly and greatly increasing its public debt levels? The US government has been spending money and allowing the debt and [deficit to grow](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/01/28/federal-deficit-one-trillion-trump-107901) in a period of [positive economic growth](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-45827430).    Now, with [economic recession predicted](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/19/bank-of-america-says-the-recession-is-already-here-jobs-will-be-lost-wealth-will-be-destroyed.html), the US government is planning on spending a [large sum of money](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/19/politics/coronavirus-economic-stimulus-senate-republicans/index.html) to lesson the blow to the economy.   ---  In 'normal' economic climate, there are already competing views on how much public debt is [too much](https://www.economist.com/free-exchange/2015/06/03/how-much-is-too-much).  It the midst of this recent crisis, it might be good to visit what increasing public debt could mean for the US.  ---    1. What are the potential effects of rapidly increasing public debt?  2. What are some evidence based views on what are considered the 'borrowing limits', or 'too much debt limit', for public debt in the United States? How is this determined?
What are some things we could do to prevent the next pandemic? I looked up the research on the risk of emerging diseases, and found this source on the subject. It has over 2,200 citations, and it was the most thorough analysis I could find, since it looked at all harmful pathogens in humans, and also which have emerged recently, and what their characteristics were.  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1088493/  The paper finds that 75% of emerging diseases are zoonotic, meaning they are able to transmit from animals to humans, virus’s especially so.  What have governments done in the past to contain the spread of zoonotic pathogens from being transmitted to humans initially? Has there been attempts to create a pandemic/emerging disease prevention policy, rather than a mitigation policy? Have there been any governmental agencies that have had forums or policy discussions around this topic, even if they have never taken any actionable steps? If they did consider an actionable step but did not take it, what were their concerns?  Thank you.
The Trump administration is looking at the possibility of direct cash payments to Americans to mitigate the economic hardships of Covid-19. Logistically, how can the US government provide cash payments to citizens, and has this ever been done before? At least [two](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/16/politics/coronavirus-romney-proposal/index.html) GOP [Senators](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/487939-gop-sen-cotton-calls-for-monthly-cash-payments-to-americans-during) have proposed direct cash payments to Americans to mitigate the economic damage caused by Covid-19.   Direct cash payments are now on the table as part of the [White House's economic response to Covid-19](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/17/mnuchin-says-trump-administration-is-looking-to-get-cash-to-americans-immediately.html):  > Potentially $250 billion of the package could go toward making direct payments to Americans, a White House official told The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday.  ---  1. How can the Federal government logistically handle giving direct cash payments to every American?  2. Have direct cash payments ever been tried in the US before? How was it administered?  3. Have other countries tried cash payments? How was it administered?
[Meta] COVID-19 Fact Checking Resources On March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized the outbreak of COVID-19 [(aka novel coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019) as a [pandemic](https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020). As such, the moderation team felt compelled to provide some guidelines to assist all participants in developing their own fact-based understanding of the COVID-19 outbreak.  We acknowledge this post is not typical for /r/NeutralPolitics but the moderation team felt it necessary to push back against the [spread of misinformation](https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-HEALTH-RESEARCH/0100B5ES3MG/index.html) in hopes of keeping everyone both well informed and safe.    ***What is COVID-19 and what symptoms does it cause?***   COVID-19 is a [viral infection](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf) caused by a member of a family of large viruses known as coronavirus. Originally isolated to Wuhan,China, the illness has now been reported in [118 countries across all major continents](https://who.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/c88e37cfc43b4ed3baf977d77e4a0667).   Symptoms appear to occur within [2-14 days](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/symptoms.html) after initial exposure, with [one study](https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2762808/incubation-period-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-from-publicly-reported) suggesting an average incubation period of 5.1 days. It is possible to be infected with the COVID-19 virus but not show any symptoms of illness, a state known as asymptomatic infection. Asymptomatic infection is considered relatively rare and early data suggests that asymptomatic viral shedding [does not appear to be a driver of infection](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf). Most symptoms are generally mild and begin gradually but include fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea.   Currently the [basic reproduction number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number) or R0 (pronounced R-naught or R-zero) is estimated to be anywhere from [2.0](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf) to [3.11](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.23.20018549v2). The R0, which is not a fixed value, is thought of as the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection. For context, the R0 for the seasonal flu is estimated at [1.28](https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2334-14-480) while the 2009 H1N1 Influenza outbreak R0 was at 1.46 and 1.48.  While most cases are mild, [early reports from China](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2002032) indicated that 16% of COVID-19 cases were severe and as of March 11th COVID-19 mortality rates are 3.4% globally.  It's worth noting that early data is often [incomplete and can be misleading](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-deaths-from-coronavirus-are-so-high-in-italy/), with [many experts](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-mortality/why-covid-19-death-rates-are-not-what-they-seem-idUSKBN20Z281) expressing [caution over](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/early-mortality-rates-covid-19-misleading-experts/story?id=69477312) over early reported data.   ***COVID-19 Myths and Fact Checking***  As with any developing story, [myths](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/myth-busters) are common. Many health agencies and organizations [like the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/share-facts.html) or the [American Public Health Association](https://www.apha.org/topics-and-issues/communicable-disease/coronavirus) have published simple COVID-19 fact sheets that may be used to verify claims.    As a general practice it's always good to consider the source, history, evidence, emotion, and pictures (or [SHEEP)](https://firstdraftnews.org/latest/5-tips-ways-we-can-all-covid19-check-coronavirus-information-online-fake-disinformation-misinformation/) of a source.

These reports include global morbidity (the state of having the disease) and mortality (death from the disease) counts.    ***How can I protect myself?***  While we are still learning about how COVID-19 affects people, older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes) appear to develop serious illness more often than others. Fortunately, there are [many basic protective measures](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public) an individual can take to reduce their chance of COVID-19 infection.  * Frequent Hand Washing for at [least 20 seconds](https://ew.com/music/coronavirus-covid-19-hand-wash-songs/) * Maintain a proper social distance of at least 1 meter or 3 feet between you and others * Avoid touching your face * Stay at home if you're not feeling well * If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance to avoid unnecessarily overwhelming local health systems * Follow the directions of your local health authority.

How Can the Fed Inject $1.5 Trillion Into the Economy? It was just announced that the Federal Reserve will [inject $1.5 Trillion](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-to-inject-1-5-trillion-in-bid-to-prevent-unusual-disruptions-in-markets-11584033537) into the economy in order to offset losses in recent days.  The exact language, per the source above, is:  > The Federal Reserve said it would make vast sums of short-term loans available on Wall Street and purchase Treasury securities in a coronavirus-related response aimed at preventing ominous trading conditions from creating a sharper economic contraction.  Maybe this question is better suited for the folks over in /r/economics, but I just want to know how a move like this can happen in the blink of an eye, without any debate? Also, where does this money come from - assuming you can't just pull $1.5 Trillion out of thin air.
How do the major US parties handle deaths of presumptive nominees or nominees? This question is a little morbid, but given that [both of the remaining major contenders for the Democratic nomination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries#Active_candidates) and [the only major contender for the Republican nomination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Republican_Party_presidential_primaries) are over 70, and there is a pandemic illness spreading which [appears to be a particular risk for older adults](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html#who-is-higher-risk) I think it is worth discussing.  What exactly are the procedures for when a candidate dies or becomes incapacitated during the electoral process?  If before a convention, what happens to delegates accumulated by that candidate?  If after the convention, how is a replacement candidate chosen?  Is there any process for determining a nominee to be incapacitated without their consent?  These answers might differ for the two parties, so I'd appreciate if people could specify which party's rules they're discussing.

NeutralPolitics Super Tuesday Megathread Welcome to the biggest night of the primary season: Super Tuesday.  Today, 14 states as well as American Samoa^1 will be voting in primary elections to allocate delegates to the Democratic National Convention.^2  * **How are the delegates are awarded?**   The key number to keep in mind when looking at results is **15%.**  If a candidate is [above 15%](https://www.270towin.com/content/thresholds-for-delegate-allocation-2020-democratic-primary-and-caucus) in a state or congressional district, the candidate gets delegates proportional to their vote.  If you're below 15%, [you get nothing.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5QGkOGZubQ)   States award generally 1/3 of delegates statewide, and the other 2/3 by congressional district, with more delegates allocated to districts [that have voted more democratic in past Presidential elections.](https://www.thegreenpapers.com/P20/D-Alloc.phtml)^3  So if a candidate is just below the 15% bubble statewide, they still might get a few delegates from individual congressional districts where they broke 15%.    * **How many delegates are at stake tonight?**   [There are 1357 delegates up for grabs,](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/02/us/politics/2020-super-tuesday-states.html) out of a total of [3979 total.](https://www.270towin.com/2020-democratic-nomination)  1991 delegates are needed to win the nomination.     Today is a much bigger delegate haul up for grabs than in [2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries#March_1,_2016:_Super_Tuesday) largely because California moved its primary to today.  As both the most populous state and a Democratic stronghold, it has huge delegate numbers, 415, accounting for more than 1/10 of the entire number of delegates available.  * **When will we know results?**   It will vary, with the first polls closing at [7PM ET in Virginia, and the last polls closing at 11PM ET in California.](https://www.vox.com/2020/3/3/21161503/super-tuesday-voting-polls-results-what-time)   However, some results may take quite a while.  California especially is both the biggest haul today, and [famously slow](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/01/809941998/on-super-tuesday-dont-expect-quick-election-results-from-the-west) in counting ballots.  Because California encourages a lot of mail voting, and counts ballots mailed on election day, they won't have all the ballots in today, and will need to process a lot of envelopes.  * **Who is gonna win?**   Who do I look like, Nate Silver?  * **Where can I see results?**   * [Washington Post results page](https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/election-results/super-tuesday/?itid=hp_hp-bignews4_results-promo-2%3Ahomepage%2Fstory-ans)   * [CNN results page](https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/primaries-and-caucuses)   * [Fox News results page](https://www.foxnews.com/elections/2020/primary-results)     * [Decision Desk HQ](https://results.decisiondeskhq.com/2020/super_tuesday) (signup required)   * [PBS Newshour election night coverage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KU5JFZFqR_s)   * The New York Times [has 14 needles.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/03/us/elections/forecast-super-tuesday-primary.html?action=click&module=ELEX_results&pgtype=Interactive&region=Navigation)  I'll add updates as the night goes on, but first I shall engage in my election night tradition: sushi.  Before results come in, feel free to ask any questions you think I can address above, or answer my question:  Besides voting, what election day traditions or habits do you have?  **7:00PM ET** First polls have closed, and networks are calling Virginia for Biden and Vermont for Sanders at poll closing.  **7:07PM ET** Looks like the VA call is based on Biden doing _very_ well in the exit poll, which [has him around 50% to Bernie's 25%,](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-primary-elections/virginia-results?icid=election_nav) with all other candidates apparently below the viability threshold.  If that held (very big if) it would mean about 66 delegates to Biden, 33 to Bernie, 0 to anyone else.   **7:30PM ET** Polls have closed in North Carolina, and networks are calling it for Biden at polls close based on the exit poll.  **7:37PM ET** American Samoa has reported [the results](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-primary-elections/american-samoa-results?icid=election_nav) of its caucus, which looks like it will give Mike Bloomberg and Tulsi Gabbard their first delegates of the process.  Looks like it'll be 4 delegates for Bloomberg on 175 votes and, 2 for Gabbard on 103 votes.  **7:58PM ET** Looks like Biden will break the 15% threshold in Vermont, so he will get some delegates there.  In 2016 Sanders managed to keep Clinton below that threshold and got all of Vermont's delegates that year.  **8:00PM ET**  Alabama called for Biden at polls closed, no calls in other states closing at 8pm.  **8:10PM ET** Looks like a genuine three way contest for first in MA based on exit polls among Warren, Sanders, and Biden.   **8:23PM ET** Seeing some results in TX showing a close race, but I think that's early vote, so it might move a lot as we get today's vote in if trends in late deciders from VA/NC/AL hold into TX.  **8:26PM ET** For those who are election turbonerds like me, the DecisionDeskHQ people use some different methods from most of the networks to get results numbers, and are usually a good bit faster at reporting.  So if you're the kinda person who need their results now, it may be worth dealing with their signup.  **8:30PM ET** Arkansas polls closed, no call at polls close.  **8:37PM ET**  Looks like outside of MA, Warren is struggling to hit the 15% threshold in many states, so she'll probably be looking at a quite small delegate haul out of tonight, unless she does surprisingly well in CA.  She might get a few congressional district delegates still in other states, or results may change, but being below 15% statewide is a big loss in delegate terms.  Bloomberg is also shy of the mark in a few states so far.  Looks like he'll miss in VA, VT, and MA.  So far looks like he'll make it in states that have closed so far, but if that's early vote reports, he might fall on election day totals.  **8:47PM ET** With about 90% of results in from Virginia, NYT is allocating about 67 delegates to Biden, 31 delegates to Sanders, 1 to Warren.  **9:00PM ET** Texas, Minnesota, and Colorado polls close.  No calls at closing.  **9:03PM ET** Biden is expanding his lead in NC as same day vote comes in, with Bloomberg falling and possibly on track to end up below the threshold.  **9:11PM ET** Looks like networks are calling TN for Biden.  Seems that Biden, Sanders, and Bloomberg will all make the threshold there.  **9:17PM ET** More calls: OK for Biden, CO for Sanders.  **9:31PM ET**  MA is looking likely Biden, Sanders 2nd, Warren actually close to the threshold in her home state.  Fairly disastrous for Warren.  **9:37PM ET** Gonna take a moment to recognize the recently departed-from-the-race Amy Klobuchar for [the best walk on music of the campaign.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhX06ovfnas)  **9:42PM ET**  As I said above, the 15% threshold matters a ton.  Looking at who's currently on track to make/miss it, with the proviso that this could change (and using DDHQ numbers)  * Biden: Gonna make it everywhere * Sanders: In some danger of missing it in AL, but safe everywhere else. * Bloomberg: Won't make it in VT or VA.  Very likely won't make it in ME, MA, AL or MN. more likely than not to miss it it in OK and TN.  In danger if late returns are bad for him in TN and TX.  Likely safe in AR.  Certain to make it in CO. * Warren: Won't make it in most states.  Has a good shot of making it in ME, MN, and CO.  Almost certain to make it in MA.  None of these include California because polls are still open there.  **9:50PM ET**  NBC News reports that Bloomberg will ["reassess"](https://twitter.com/JesseRodriguez/status/1235028685717045248) his campaign tomorrow.  **9:56PM ET** Some, but not all, networks calling AR and MN for Biden.  **10:11PM ET**  Polls closed in Utah at 10PM.  Sanders holds a susbtantial lead there in early returns.  **10:14PM ET**  Update on who's hitting the 15% threshold.  Sanders looks safer to make it in Alabama, meaning he would get at least some delegates everywhere.  Bloomberg has fallen below threshold in Oklahoma and North Carolina, still teetering above it in Tennessee.  **10:31PM ET** DDHQ (but nobody else I can see) is calling MA for Biden.  If that holds, that's an extremely good sign for him.  This is really about as good of a Super Tuesday as Biden could have asked for so far.  Though California is still not even polls closed, and that is the big prize of the night.  **10:35PM ET** Utah has been called for Sanders.  **10:52PM ET** Reports are that in many precincts in California and Texas, long lines are going to delay vote results, and of course those lines reflect a substantial failure of election officials to do their job and operate an efficient election.  **11:00PM ET** Polls are now closed in California, though many voters remain in line.  If you are in line to vote, stay in line and you will be able to vote.  **11:03PM ET** AP is calling California for Sanders at polls close.  I find that a bit surprising, but I assume they have some good reasons for doing so.  **11:04PM ET** Other networks are not calling California.  I am really surprised by the AP call on zero results, especially in a heavily mail-vote state which is infamously slow to count.  I think Sanders is more likely than not to win CA (it's a strong state for him generally, and heavy early vote helps him).  But with the big late movement to Biden I'd want to get some real votes in to make that call.  **11:09PM ET** OK, I assume AP is making the call based on the exit poll, which as of 6:30PM ET had [Bernie around 38 and Biden around 23.](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-primary-elections/california-results?icid=election_nav)  That's aggressive, but if it represents same day voters even close to accurately, I can see being comfortable with the call.  But I'd still hold off on a call.  **11:19PM ET** Gonna make a threshold chart to show where candidates are making/missing it.    Legend:  Bold is made the threshold.  Italic is missed the threshold.  Standard is uncertain.  * Biden: **ME, VT, MA, VA, NC, TN, AL, AR, OK, TX, CO, UT, MN, CA**  * Sanders: **ME, VT, MA, VA, NC, TN,** AL, **AR, OK, TX, CO, UT, MN, CA**  * Bloomberg: *ME, VT, MA, VA, NC,* **TN,** *AL,* AR, *OK,* TX, **CO, UT,** *MN,* CA  * Warren: ME, *VT,* **MA,** *VA, NC, TN, AL, AR, OK, TX,* **CO, UT,** MN, *CA*  **11:32PM ET** It looks like Texas will be very close between Biden and Sanders.  Given proportional allocation, it actually doesn't matter that much who ekes out a win if they're within a point of each other, though it may matter for narrative.  Much bigger is the question of whether Mike Bloomberg holds on to enough vote to crack 15% and swipe a share of delegates.  Currently he is at 18.19% which might hold him through what's been a consistent drop in day-of results for him today, but maybe not.  With it now looking like Biden would have the only path to the nomination with a majority of pledged delegates, whether Bloomberg hits the threshold in Texas could actually make a big difference.  It's probably worth on the order or 25 or so delegates.  **11:55PM ET** Based on early returns not being strong for her in CA, plus her weak performance nationwide in same day vote, I am going to project that Warren does *not* make the threshold in California.  That's a significant boost to Sanders, as it probably means he's consolidated more of the left-wing vote there, and means he has to share fewer delegates out of the only state tonight where he's still got a shot at earning big delegate haul.  **12:02AM ET** With 100% reporting in TN, I can say Mike Bloomberg has made the threshold there.  NYT projects 34 Biden delegates,  21 Sanders, 9 Bloomberg out of TN.  **12:09AM ET** With over 90% reporting in Utah and Colorado (per DDHQ) I am comfortable calling that Warren _will_ make the threshold in those states.  That will cut down the haul Sanders gets out of them, though if Warren eventually drops out and supports Sanders, he would benefit on net from this outcome.  (That is a big "if").  **12:17AM ET** Biden is now on track to win Texas, and probably by a few points.  The delegate math is hard to pencil out because Bloomberg is still dropping on same day results, and flirting with the 15% threshold.  My best guess is Biden nets ~12 delegates if Bloomberg makes the threshold, and nets ~20 delegates if Bloomberg misses it.  Perhaps more importantly, Biden probably gets 20 more delegates in absolute terms if Bloomberg misses the threshold than if he makes it, which helps his prospects for a first ballot win.  **12:28AM ET** I am gonna call the liveblog here because I like sleep.  Overall, this is about as good a Super Tuesday for Biden as he could have asked for.  Sanders is in contention but in trouble.  Warren and Bloomberg do not seem to have any viable path to the nomination.  ---  ^1 American Samoa had a caucus.  ^2 There is also a Republican primary today, but it is not seriously contested.  ^3 If they didn't do this, then you'd see districts which are heavily republican get far more delegates per democratic primary voter than heavily democratic districts.
What precedent, if any, does the “House Judiciary Committee v. Don McGahn” case set for future Presidential non-compliance of Congressional subpoenas? The appeals opinion can be read [here]( https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/29F7900862BA6CD68525851C00784758/$file/19-5331-1831001.pdf)  For a quick background, in May 2019, the House Judiciary Committee issued a subpoena to Don McGahn, former White House Counsel, to compel testimony regarding “Trump’s efforts to impede former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation that documented Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election.”[[1]( https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-mcgahn/u-s-appeals-court-grants-trump-bid-to-block-mcgahn-testimony-to-congress-idUSKCN20M38Z)] McGahn defied the subpoena under the direction of the Trump Administration, which “argued both that senior presidential advisers are ‘absolutely immune’ from being forced to testify to Congress about official acts and that courts lack jurisdiction to resolve such disputes.”[[1](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-mcgahn/u-s-appeals-court-grants-trump-bid-to-block-mcgahn-testimony-to-congress-idUSKCN20M38Z)]  The House Judiciary Committee sued in August, and the judge overseeing the case ruled that McGahn must testify in November. However, the decision was expectedly appealed, and on Friday, Feb. 28th, the Appeals court finally made their decision. The majority opinion effectively argued that the court “had no place in settling [disputes] between the executive and legislative branches of the U.S. government”[[1](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-mcgahn/u-s-appeals-court-grants-trump-bid-to-block-mcgahn-testimony-to-congress-idUSKCN20M38Z)] and that Congress has “ample but imperfect tools at its disposal”[[2](https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/29F7900862BA6CD68525851C00784758/$file/19-5331-1831001.pdf)]:  > Congress (or one of its chambers) may hold officers in contempt, withhold appropriations, refuse to confirm the President’s nominees, harness public opinion, delay or derail the President’s legislative agenda, or impeach recalcitrant officers.[[2](https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/29F7900862BA6CD68525851C00784758/$file/19-5331-1831001.pdf)]  What precedent does this set for future Presidential non-compliance of Congressional subpoenas?   Especially in regards to impeachments, which are arguably some of the most contentious times the Executive branch would defy Congressional subpoenas, what avenues, going forward, does Congress have to obtain pertinent information from the Executive branch, either during the inquiry or trial phase of an impeachment?
What are the legal authorities relating to quarantines in the US? With the spread of the [Coronavirus dubbed COVID-19](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) and US domestic authorities saying that ["it is likely that this virus will cause a pandemic,"](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/summary.html#risk-assessment) I want to know a bit more about the legal authorities around quarantines in the US.  [This page from the CDC provides some information on the subject](https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/aboutlawsregulationsquarantineisolation.html) but leaves some questions open.   In particular:  * Does the Federal government have the authority to impose quarantine requirements on individuals within the US absent special circumstances like interstate or international travel?  * What are the circumstances and procedures under which any quarantine or isolation orders could be subject to legal challenge?  * If there is a conflict between federal and state officials related to a quarantine question, how does that get resolved?  * Can federal officials commandeer state-owned or privately-owned resources (such as hospital facilities, medicine stocks, etc) to effectuate quarantine or other public health measures?
How would a wealth tax in the United States be structured, compared to those previously implemented across European countries? Democratic presidential candidates [Elizabeth Warren](https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/ultra-millionaire-tax) and [Bernie Sanders](https://berniesanders.com/issues/tax-extreme-wealth/) have in recent months advocated for a wealth tax on the very rich, promoting it as a progressive tax that can in turn help fund additional progressive policy measures. However, the viability of such a wealth tax has been questioned.^^[\[1\]](https://www.politifact.com/article/2019/apr/25/elizabeth-warren-does-her-wealth-tax-pay-her-child/) ^^[\[2\]](https://taxfoundation.org/elizabeth-warren-wealth-tax-oecd/) ^^[\[3\]](https://www.factcheck.org/2019/06/facts-on-warrens-wealth-tax-plan/) Critics draw evidence from the flaws realized in such taxes implemented in various European countries, noting concerns about tax evasion, difficulty of wealth evaluation and enforcement, and capital flight and decreased foreign investment. While up to 14 European countries have previously implemented a wealth tax, [only Switzerland, Spain, and Norway still have one in place](https://www.cesifo-group.de/DocDL/dice-report-2018-2-drometer-frank-hofbauer-p%C3%A9rez-rhode-schworm-stitteneder.pdf), although Belgium, the Netherlands, and Italy have some form of limited wealth taxation.  If a wealth tax similar to the ones proposed by Senators Warren and Sanders were to be introduced in the United States, what measures would need to be taken to avoid the problems present in current and past wealth taxes in Europe? Proponents of a wealth tax, such as [Professors Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, argue](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2019/09/05/estimating-the-economic-impact-of-a-wealth-tax/) that the much higher exemption thresholds in Warren's and Sanders' proposals would largely avoid targeting households with high net worth but low liquid assets, and the existence of the [Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Account_Tax_Compliance_Act) makes tax avoidance easier to combat. The OECD also recommends strictly limiting exemptions for assets, which is part of Warren's plan.^^[3] Do these factors adequately address concerns?
Did any of the American founders document their reasoning for the appointment process for selecting the United States Attorney General? [The Judiciary Act of 1789](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Judiciary-Act-of-1789) established the position of United States Attorney General as a cabinet level position. Per usual, all Cabinet members of the United States are [first nominated by the President and then confirmed by the Senate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_the_United_States#Confirmation_process) through a simple majority.  However, [43 states](https://www.naag.org/publications/naagazette/volume-4-number-1/elections-for-attorneys-general-to-take-place-in-30-states.php) choose to elect Attorneys General. Of the remaining 7 States, 5 States allow for Governor's to approve their AG, Tennessee's Supreme Court appoints their AG, and Maine's legislature uses a secret ballot to appoint their AG. Which led me to wonder :     *  Did any of the American founders document their reasoning for the appointment process for selecting the United States Attorney General? * Are there documented reasons as to why the vast majority of states choose to elect an Attorney General rather than follow the federal example?   Thanks to /u/LesserPolymerBeasts for the initial idea. This is a rework of their submission.
Who is actually affected by the Trump administration's "public charge" rule? First time poster, please forgive any errors in formatting.  &#x200B;  Last October, new rules regarding who would be a public charge for immigration purposes would have gone into effect, but they were blocked by several lawsuits.  The Supreme Court has recently lifted the injunction against implementing the rule  [https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/484196-supreme-court-allow-public-charge-rule-to-take-effect-across-country](https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/484196-supreme-court-allow-public-charge-rule-to-take-effect-across-country)  According to the text of the rule ( [https://www.uscis.gov/news/fact-sheets/public-charge-fact-sheet](https://www.uscis.gov/news/fact-sheets/public-charge-fact-sheet)), the benefits that are included are:  * Supplemental Security Income;   * Temporary Assistance for Needy Families;  * Any federal, state, local, or tribal cash benefit programs for income maintenance (often called general assistance in the state context, but which may exist under other names);   * Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly called food stamps);  * Section 8 Housing Assistance under the Housing Choice Voucher Program;  * Section 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance (including Moderate Rehabilitation);   * Public Housing (under the Housing Act of 1937, 42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.); and  * Federally funded Medicaid (with certain exclusions).   The rule applies to those who are seeking to adjust their status to become a legal permanent resident or certain nonimmigrants.  However, most nonimmigrants are ineligible for these benefits  [https://immigrationforum.org/article/fact-sheet-immigrants-and-public-benefits/](https://immigrationforum.org/article/fact-sheet-immigrants-and-public-benefits/) .  If there is a U.S. Citizen child in the household that would qualify for the benefits, that is not supposed to be held against the immigrant as the child would be entitled to receive them.  There are certain exceptions to the rule, ie. these are not held against the immigrant for purposes of determining a public charge, and include-  * Emergency medical assistance;   * Disaster relief;   * National school lunch programs;   * The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children ;   * The Children’s Health Insurance Program;   * Subsidies for foster care and adoption;   * Government-subsidized student and mortgage loans;  * Energy assistance;   * Food pantries and homeless shelters; and  * Head Start.      Certain categories of immigrants are also excluded, including refugees, asylees, T and U Visa applicants, and certain VAWA applicants.  So, my question is- Given that the vast majority of federal public benefits are off-limits to nonimmigrants, and the groups of people and types of assistance that are already not subject to the rule, who will actually be affected? 
[META] A Discussion About Neutral Politics Submission Rules At /r/NeutralPolitics, we strive to achieve to be as impartial and neutral in what we accept regarding submission questions. Currently, the rules are strict, meaning that only good quality discussions are created - and that sources can be provided for the question. For this reason, we do not allow questions that are requests for speculation, per rule G.  However, it has recently come up that some mods have differing interpretation on what counts as being a rule G violation.  Currently, the rules say that if a "question cannot be answered with facts", then it is not acceptable. But as moderators, we do not/can not judge whether a post is answerable with facts as we are not omnipotent beings.

But for submission questions whose answers are potentially/likely speculative, are they *acceptable* under the current definition of rule G?    If the current rule G wording is confusing, and/or too vague, how should it be reworded?  Additionally, if you are able to, could you provide us with what you think rule G *currently* covers, and what rule G should / shouldn't cover in the future.   *A reminder that rule G currently doesn't reject speculative questions - i.e. questions that ask about mainly about theory or the potential effect of something.

What are the upsides and criticisms of a "Medicare for All Who Want It" plan? Pete Buttigieg is currently running on a platform that includes ["Medicare for All Who Want It"](https://peteforamerica.com/policies/health-care/), a more moderate alternative to Sanders' and Warren's "Medicare for All" plan.  From his website,  >The Medicare for All Who Want It public alternative will help America reach universal coverage by providing an affordable insurance option to the currently uninsured. The public alternative will provide the same essential health benefits as those currently available on the marketplaces and ensure that everyone has access to high-quality, comprehensive coverage.   >   >The plan will automatically enroll individuals in affordable coverage if they are eligible for it, while those eligible for subsidized coverage will have a simple enrollment option. A backstop fund will reimburse health care providers for unpaid care to patients who are uninsured. Individuals who fall through the cracks will be retroactively enrolled in the public option.  Proponents of the plan argue that it provides all Americans with affordable healthcare coverage without the expense that comes with replacing private healthcare, and would incentivize private healthcare to keep their prices low. Opponents ([New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/opinion/medicare-for-all.html) incoming) argue that: "the price of health care services — not insurance or pharmaceutical profits — is the primary driver of America’s ballooning health care spending. Only a single-payer system can restrain those costs." [Conservative critics](https://thefederalist.com/2019/10/29/why-pete-buttigiegs-medicare-for-all-who-want-it-is-a-sham/) of the plan seem to fear that it will eventually lead to the elimination of private insurance altogether.  What are the benefits and drawbacks of this type of plan (particularly compared to the Medicare for All and/or our current system)? How feasible is this? I am having trouble finding reliable & detailed arguments for this, since searching "Medicare for All Who Want It" usually just returns results about Medicare for All.
What precedent is there, among industrialized countries, for Sanders plan to democratize the workplace? Sen. Sanders plan to democratize the workplace can be found here: https://berniesanders.com/issues/corporate-accountability-and-democracy/  Specifically, I am interested in his plan to require certain types of corporations (publically traded or $100 million in revenue) to have 45% board control by the workers (unions) along with 20% ownership in stock for workers.   Is this a policy also found in the Scandinavian social democracies, or other countries? If so, what similarities and differences are there between them and Sanders plan?
Is there historical precedent for a gag order remaining in place following sentencing in a trial? The sentencing phase of the Roger Stone trial has just finished.  During the trial there was a gag order placed on Roger Stone after some notable outbursts.  My understanding of a gag order is that it prevents "pollution" of or interference with the jury.  Now that the jury work is complete, however the gag order remains.  For all I know this happens all the time, but it does seem weird.  [https://www.ajc.com/news/live-coverage-trump-ally-roger-stone-sentenced-thursday/u1WjP5IIHm4swMrVDiTWvN/](https://www.ajc.com/news/live-coverage-trump-ally-roger-stone-sentenced-thursday/u1WjP5IIHm4swMrVDiTWvN/)  >U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson took Barr’s recommendation of 40 months in sentencing the president’s longtime friend. She also fined Stone $20,000 and continued a gag order, prohibiting Stone from speaking about the case.  For those who haven't been following, Stone was a campaign adviser to Trump in the 2016 campaign.  He was found guilty of making false statement to the House Intelligence Committee and to witness intimidation.  Early in the trial, Stone was placed under a gag order that included social media.  Now that the trial and sentencing is done, this gag is still in place.
How do you hand-count votes under Woodall's Smith+IRV method? My municipality (a small suburb you've never heard of) is currently debating its voting system. Right now, the argument is between First-Past-The-Post and Instant Runoff Voting (we would be able to rank up to six choices).  I want to introduce Woodall's Smith+IRV method into the conversation. Woodall's method is explained [here](https://www.daneckam.com/?p=374) and, more formally, [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20191020185838/https://rangevoting.org/SmithIRV.html).  In a nutshell, Woodall avoids the "spoiler effect" of first-past-the-post voting. However, as a Condorcet method, Woodall also avoids the "center squeeze effect" of IRV, where consensus Condorcet winners are squeezed out for [no very good reason](http://zesty.ca/voting/sim/), which most famously happened in the [2009 Burlington Mayor's race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Burlington_mayoral_election).  Here's the problem, though: while machines are allowed to produce preliminary counts, my state requires that all election totals be hand-counted. (I support this requirement, but it does complicate my preferred voting method.) Our last mayoral race saw about 10,000 votes cast in three precincts. How can we quickly and efficiently hand-count that using Woodall's method?  Meanwhile, for the prelim counts, my state uses optical-scan voting machines with no real capacity for ranking. Getting new voting machines is, for various reasons, not an option. Other cities have gotten around this by using top-3 or top-6 IRV, which allows them to print optical-friendly ballots that look [like this](http://vote.minneapolismn.gov/rcv/HOW-RCV-WORKS).  (Both [Minneapolis](http://vote.minneapolismn.gov/rcv/WCMSP-193817) and [St. Paul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wFLU3ntWxM) have also come up with fairly clever hand-counting systems for their IRV methods.)   However, I'm not sure whether limiting voters to 3 choices (or 6 choices) compromises the integrity of Woodall's method. I just don't have the mathematics background to be sure. So limiting it to top-3 may not be an option for me. Even if it is okay, I'm not seeing how to adapt those hand-counting methods to work for Woodall.  I can't really introduce Woodall at the local level without answering these questions. How can we quickly, efficiently, and reliably hand-count Woodall's method? (Can we limit Woodall's method to ranking the top-3 or top-6 choices without compromising the results?) And how can we design our ballots so that our voting machines can provide quick, correct preliminary results on election night? Surely there is *some* literature out there about this!  Thanks for your insights, and also thanks for any resources you can point me toward.  *EDIT: Resubmitted after making changes based on moderator advice.*
What measures have been proposed, and what measures have been enacted to prevent foreign interference in the 2020 US presidential election? The overwhelming consensus position of the US Government is that Russia attempted to influence the 2016 presidential election. Quoting from the the [6 January 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3254239-Russia-Hacking-report.html) - an analytic assessment drafted and coordinated among The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and The National Security Agency (NSA) - (emphasis original):  > **Russian efforts to influence the 2016 US presidential election represent the most recent expression of Moscow’s longstanding desire to undermine the US-led liberal democratic order, but these activities demonstrated a significant escalation in directness, level of activity, and scope of effort compared to previous operations.**  > **We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election.  Russia’s goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency.  We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.**  We have high confidence in these judgments.  > * **We also assess Putin and the Russian Government aspired to help President-elect Trump’s election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him. All three agencies agree with this judgment.**  CIA and FBI have high confidence in this judgment;NSA has moderate confidence.  &nbsp;  The DOJ indicted [thirteen Russian nationals and three Russian companies for committing federal crimes while seeking to interfere in the United States political system, including the 2016 Presidential election](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/grand-jury-indicts-thirteen-russian-individuals-and-three-russian-companies-scheme-interfere).  &nbsp;   The 2018 House Intelligence Committee Republican report and the 2018 House Intelligence Committee Democrat rebuttal agree that [Russia interfered in the 2016 election](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/house-intelligence-committee-gop-releases-final-russia-report/2018/04/27/cfea31e2-4a20-11e8-9072-f6d4bc32f223_story.html).   &nbsp;   The bipartisan Senate Select Committee on Intelligence found that [The Russian government directed extensive activity, beginning in at least 2014 and carrying into at least 2017, against U.S. election infrastructure' at the state and local level](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6214170/Senate-Intel-Report-On-Election-Interference.pdf), and the headline recommendations included:  * Create Effective Deterrence * Improve Information Gathering and Sharing on Threats * Secure Election-Related Cyber Systems * Take Steps to Secure the Vote Itself  &nbsp;   Additionally, there is evidence that [other countries](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-interference-idUSKCN1OK2FS) - e.g., Iran, China - sought to influence voters in the U.S. 2018 mid-term elections  &nbsp;   And as recently as *last week*, [Intelligence officials warned House lawmakers that Russia was interfering in the 2020 campaign](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/20/us/politics/russian-interference-trump-democrats.html).    &nbsp;   In light of all this...  * What measures have been proposed (e.g., through legislation) since the 2016 election to combat foreign interference in the 2020 US presidential election? * What measures have been enacted since the 2016 election to combat foreign interference in the 2020 US presidential election?
Have countries with diminishing populations adopted policies to ameliorate the demographic changes? The total fertility rate ([TRF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_fertility_rate)) of the United States has been steadily declining [since 2010](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr68/nvsr68_13-508.pdf) and as of 2018 stands at [1.73](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/05/22/u-s-fertility-rate-explained/). In the US, a TFR of 2.08 is believed to be the  [replacement level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_fertility_rate#Replacement_rates) or the rate needed to sustain a population levels.   However this issue is not unique to the United States. In 2014, Japan's [estimated population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aging_of_Japan) was 127 million. Current predictions expect that number to decrease by 24% to 97 million by 2050. Similar falls in fertility rates are seen [across Europe](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/23/baby-crisis-europe-brink-depopulation-disaster). Given these global trends  * What are there known impacts of a declining population? Are there specific economic impacts?  * Have countries with diminishing populations adopted policies to ameliorate the demographic changes? Is there evidence characterizing their effectiveness?
What constitutes an "initial policy" when determining whether a topic represents a political question? In the landmark 1962 case of [Baker v. Carr](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/369/186/#tab-opinion-1943624), the Supreme Court overturned precedent set in [Colegrove v. Green](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/328/549/#F2),  and established that certain aspects of redistricting (equal population  in districts) represent justiciable, legal questions as opposed to [political](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_question) ones.  In  making this decision, Justice Brennan outlined several tests  to guide the judiciary when determining whether a topic constituted a  political or legal question. If a topic passed any of the following  tests, it would be considered a political question untouchable by the  judiciary.  These tests were:  1. A textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department; or 2. A lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it; or 3. The impossibility of deciding without **an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for non judicial discretion**; or 4. The  impossibility of a court's undertaking independent resolution without  expressing lack of  the respect due coordinate branches of government;  or 5. An unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made; or 6. The potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by  various departments on one question.  I'm having trouble figuring out what constitutes an "initial policy determination of a kind clearly for non judicial discretion." Initially, I thought this test might be referring to cases that would force the courts to *decide* on a specific policy, (instead of merely *ruling out* the unconstitutional policy), but that was the part I wasn't sure on (hence this post).  So I guess my two questions are this:  1. What constitutes an "initial policy" when determining whether a topic is considered to be a political question?, and 2. What examples are there, if any, of the judiciary ruling a case to be political for the specific reason of "initial policy?" (ie not cases that were  ruled political for the other tests.)
Are there any examples of US states taxing foreign real estate investments as a way to curve rising home costs? If so what were the effects?  Some 2 years ago several prominent Canadian cities started enacting  various levels of taxes on foreign real estate buyers, Toronto was the  first notable city to do so, imposing a [15% tax on foreign real estate buyers](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/20/toronto-foreign-tax-homes-housing-market-canada)  with the hopes of controlling the price of housing considering that  foreign investment had been on the rise for several years. The most  notable of the foreign buyers are the growing number of Chinese  investors which are [reshaping the market in Canada](https://www.macleans.ca/economy/economicanalysis/chinese-real-estate-investors-are-reshaping-the-market/), and the [United States.](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/08/chinese-middle-class-buying-up-american-residential-real-estate.html) Some of the more notable housing shortages in the US have been the Californian housing shortage, which has been the cause of a [180,000 yearly housing construction shortage](https://calmatters.org/explainers/housing-costs-high-california/). A more recent example which has slowly been creeping up has been a [shortage of affordable housing  in Florida as well](https://www.sun-sentinel.com/opinion/editorials/fl-editorial-affordable-housing-crisis-20170519-story.html). Now [some media outlets](https://globalnews.ca/news/3636579/vancouver-foreign-homebuyers-tax-one-year-anniversary/) have found that  the tax was effective in [short term reductions in home prices](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/real-estate/the-market/canada-housing-reform-impact-foreign-buyers/article35854598/),  and home buying, but isn't an effective long term solution considering  that home prices slowly creeped up in the following years. What are some  other models from other countries that have tried to curb foreign real  estate investment?

2020 New Hampshire Primary megathread Today is primary day in New Hampshire!  Following the total [meltdown](https://www.npr.org/2020/02/04/802681380/what-the-iowa-meltdown-means-and-where-we-go-from-here) of the Iowa Democratic caucuses, I am hoping that New Hampshire will actually give us some results tonight.  Polls close at either [7 or 8pm local time depending on town.](https://ballotpedia.org/State_Poll_Opening_and_Closing_Times_(2020\))  Polling before the Democratic primary [put Sen. Sanders in the lead, followed by Mayor Buttigieg, and then a very close contest for third among Sens. Warren and Klobuchar and VP Biden.](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/nh/new_hampshire_democratic_presidential_primary-6276.html)  The Republican primary is not expected to be a big contest.  I'll provide updates as the night goes on.    Resources:  [New York Times' (in)famous needle forecast.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/02/11/us/elections/results-new-hampshire-live-forecast.html?action=click&module=ELEX_results&pgtype=Interactive&region=Navigation)  [CNN results page](https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/state/new-hampshire)  ---  **7:00PM EST**  Polls have closed in many locations.  **7:06PM EST**  If you're wondering about seeing results of a couple dozen votes, those are from the New Hampshire tradition of a few small towns having [midnight voting](https://www.wgbh.org/news/news/2020/02/05/three-towns-poised-to-hold-midnight-vote-for-2020-new-hampshire-primary) where, if they have 100% turnout, they can report their results immediately.  **7:17 PM**  Right now with first results, which may not be representative, seeing a big surge for Klobuchar, who is tightly behind Sanders with about 3000 votes in.  **7:30 PM**  Looks like Sanders is doing well with about a 4 point lead at 4% reporting, and Klobuchar and Buttigieg fighting it out for 2nd.  Warren in 4th and Biden 5th.  Seems very unlikely Warren or Biden has a chance to move out of their positions, which are pretty devastating for them, and probably lock them out of any delegates tonight.  **8:01 PM** All polls have closed in NH.  Networks are (unsurprisingly) calling the R primary for Trump.  Not calling the D side yet.  **8:03 PM** Andrew Yang [is dropping out of the Presidential race.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/andrew-yang-drops-out-of-presidential-race/2020/02/11/4fe2c97c-4c2c-11ea-9b5c-eac5b16dafaa_story.html)  **8:28 PM** It seems clear Warren and Biden will not make the 15% threshold to get delegates.  **8:33 PM** Michael Bennet [is dropping out of the Presidential race.](https://twitter.com/JesseRodriguez/status/1227404987086622721)  **8:47 PM** Buttigieg is closing the gap a bit in newer returns with Sanders, and separating himself a bit from Klobuchar.  Seems most probable outcome (but easily could change) is Sanders, Buttigieg, Klobuchar in that order.  **9:13 PM**  Sanders, Buttigieg, and Klobuchar will be the only 3 candidates to win delegates tonight, according to multiple network calls.  **9:33 PM** I am seeing the most complete results from [Decision Desk HQ here.](https://results.decisiondeskhq.com/2020/primary/new_hampshire/president)  **10:24 PM** Deval Patrick [is dropping out.](https://twitter.com/Grace_Segers/status/1227432889807228930)  **11:21 PM** Networks have all called the race for Sanders, looks like delegate allocation will be 9 Sanders, 9 Buttigieg, 6 Klobuchar. Gonna end the tick tock here since we have a pretty final result.
Do the changing sentencing positions of the US government in the Roger Stone case constitute a violation of US law or DoJ policy? Yesterday the Department of Justice filed a [sentencing memorandum](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.203583/gov.uscourts.dcd.203583.279.0_2.pdf) for Roger Stone, who had provided information from WikiLeaks to the Trump campaign during 2016.  Stone was convicted in November 2019 by a jury of obstructing a Congressional investigation, making false statements to Congress, and witness tampering.  In that sentencing memorandum, the DoJ sought a sentence within the range they calculated the US Sentencing Guidelines to suggest of 87 to 108 months (7-9 years).  Stone's attorneys [disputed](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.203583/gov.uscourts.dcd.203583.280.0.pdf) the guidelines calculation made by the government, and believe the guidelines range should be 15-21 months imprisonment.  They also requested a downward departure from that range, seeking only probation without incarceration.  After the sentencing memorandum from the government was filed, President Trump [tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1227122206783811585)   >"This is a horrible and very unfair situation. The real crimes were on the other side, as nothing happens to them. Cannot allow this miscarriage of justice!"    >>@ChuckRossDC  "Prosecutors recommend up to NINE YEARS in prison for Roger Stone. They call foreign election interference a "deadly adversary" even though Stone was never accused of working with Russians or WikiLeaks."  After the President's tweet, news broke that the Department of Justice intended to file a second sentencing memorandum, [overriding the prosecutors who had signed the original sentencing memorandum.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-stone/in-reversal-justice-department-to-seek-shorter-sentence-for-trump-adviser-stone-idUSKBN2052E5)  After that news breaking, one of the prosecutors who had signed the original sentencing brief [gave notice to the court that he was no longer working on the case, and had resigned as a special assistant US Attorney for the District of Columbia.](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.203583/gov.uscourts.dcd.203583.282.0_5.pdf)  A second prosecutor also [resigned as an Assistant US Attorney](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.203583/gov.uscourts.dcd.203583.283.0_3.pdf) shortly thereafter.  **Edit for subsequent developments.**  The DoJ has filed a ["supplemental and amended"](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.203583/gov.uscourts.dcd.203583.286.0_5.pdf) sentencing memorandum, signed by John Crabb, Jr, who was not one of the attorneys previously on the case.  The supplemental memorandum says:  >The prior filing submitted by the United States on February 10, 2020 (Gov. Sent. Memo. ECF No. 279) does not accurately reflect the Department of Justice’s position on what would be a reasonable sentence in this matter. While it remains the position of the United States that a sentence of incarceration is warranted here, the government respectfully submits that the range of 87 to 108 months presented as the applicable advisory Guidelines range would not be appropriate or serve the interests of justice in this case  A third attorney previously the case, [Adam Jed](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.203583/gov.uscourts.dcd.203583.285.0_10.pdf) has also withdrawn from the case.  ---  My questions are:  1.  If the DoJ changed its position due to the President's tweet, or other pressure from the President, is that lawful?  Does it make a difference that the conduct Stone lied about related to the President's campaign?  2.  Is it in compliance with DoJ guidelines for attorneys, or the rules of professional ethics?
Is the firing of Sondland and Vindman a criminal offense?

How does the Republican Party's enthusiasm for tax cuts compare to other right of center political parties among G20 countries? In the US the Republican Party is [famous for cutting taxes](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/09/us-parties-republican-democrat-taxes.asp), most recently with the [Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.](https://taxfoundation.org/the-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act-simplified-the-tax-filing-process-for-millions-of-americans/)  However prioritizing tax cuts appears to be a relatively recent development.  [George H.W. Bush raised taxes in 1990](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnibus_Budget_Reconciliation_Act_of_1990) and famous tax-cutter Reagan [raised taxes a few times in the 80's:](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2017-12-15/the-mostly-forgotten-tax-increases-of-1982-1993)  This led me to wonder: Do other right of center political parties among other G20 countries prioritize tax cuts in the same manner as the American Republican Party?  For example, should I expect the tax policies of right of center parties in Germany and India to be similar to that of the Republican Party in the US?
Did Nancy Pelosi violate federal law in tearing up the President's SOTU Address documents? There is a [federal statute regarding document destruction] (https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2071), and the penalty for for unlawful or accidental destruction is fine or imprisonment.  [Congressman Matt Gaetz] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Gaetz) has alleged that [Nancy Pelosi violated federal laws in tearing up the president's SOTU address](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/standing-behind-trump-nancy-pelosi-rips-copy-his-state-union-n1130331) and has [filed an ethics complaint against Pelosi for her actions] (https://www.cbsnews.com/news/matt-gaetz-nancy-pelosi-ethics-complaint-state-of-the-union-rip-speech/)  Some have said the [copies of the speech that are handed to the VP and Speaker are the "official" record of the speech](https://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2020/02/06/gaetz-files-ethics-complaint-against-pelosi-n2560865) for each respective body (one for the senate and one for the house). Other have said these are just [copies, and only one exists for the official federal record] (https://www.ktvb.com/article/news/local/208/did-nancy-pelosi-commit-a-crime-by-ripping-up-the-state-of-the-union-speech/277-29fb69fa-f8b1-4dd8-aab4-f49434a6dbc3).  So which is it? Was it illegal, and if so, should Pelosi face consequences, or was it just a copy that warrants no further legal action?
How are Delegates (or State Delegate Equivalents) calculated compared to the Popular Vote?  This may be an easy answer, but I noticed with 71% of Iowa results in that [Pete has a narrow lead in SDE while Bernie has the lead in the popular vote](https://www.npr.org/2020/02/04/802620457/buttigieg-and-sanders-lead-after-first-batch-of-iowa-results-is-released?fbclid=IwAR2yzREF3gIz9MZbaaJ56-1gsm5g_NWj1PlhVM-Lno0c56jD4Ertsglee4c) (I know this is an older article but the percentage differences have remained about the same). Why is there a discrepancy? Does this have to do with not having a full count of votes in?
Why is every US State government modeled after the Federal government? Almost all states use the ["presidential" system of governance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_U.S._state_governments), with a bicameral legislature, legislators are elected using single member districts, and a separate executive branch exists for the office of the governor. While minor variations in procedure exist within each state's constitution, the overall electoral process and structure of their government remains almost identical. [Reynolds vs Sims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reynolds_v._Sims) case broadly outlined that states had to adopt some form of representation that is equal for all citizens in their legislature if they use districts.  Could states experimented with a parliamentary system of government or attempted any other form of electoral selection like proportional representation or sortition? Are there legal barriers preventing this, or is it mostly cultural/systemic?
What are the advantages and disadvantages of constitutionalizing the US impeachment trial procedure? [The vote over not allowing witnesses and new evidence in the impeachment trial has dominated news cycles lately](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/01/31/us/politics/impeachment-vote.html). Are these elements of a trial that are so fundamental to the proceedings, that they should be accepted out of hand? (And/or there are other fundamental elements of a trial that were skipped that should also be deemed necessary?)  Did the framers leave [the process of the impeachment trial](https://constitutionus.com/#a1s2c5) too open-ended when they allowed for the possibility of the president being acquitted without witnesses or evidence? Are there advantages or intention behind the current vagueness of the procedures as outlined in the Constitution?  Should there be an amendment to the constitution that codifies this process and implements more standards, for example [more closely resembling criminal trial procedure](https://uscode.house.gov/browse/prelim@title18/part2/chapter223&edition=prelim)?  What are the potential downsides of this idea? EG: does this give the Chief Justice too much say in what witnesses and evidence gets allowed? Inconsistencies in going by criminal proceedings in a venue where there is no [well-defined criminal code](https://uscode.house.gov/browse/prelim@title18/part1&edition=prelim)? Are there ways to address these downsides or other ways an amendment could be framed? Should increased rigor on the Senate side raise the standards of impeachment on the House side?
Does Virginia's adoption of the Equal Rights Amendment make it law? The proposed [Equal Rights Amendment](https://www.equalrightsamendment.org/faqs) attempts to legally eliminate all gender-based discrimination. Section 1 explicitly states that:   >Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex.  On January 27th, the [Virginia legislature finalized the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/virginia-expected-to-finalize-passage-of-era-monday-setting-stage-for-legal-fight/2020/01/27/b178265c-4121-11ea-b503-2b077c436617_story.html) and became the 38th - and potentially final - state to ratify the amendment.   The [original deadline](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Equal-Rights-Amendment) for ratification was March 1979, which was later extended to June 1982. Supporters of the Equal Rights Amendment claim that ["because the deadline is in the preamble that proposes the ERA — not the text of the amendment itself — the deadline doesn't have to be observed"](https://www.npr.org/2020/01/15/796754345/virginia-ratifies-the-equal-rights-amendment-decades-after-deadline). However, the Justice Department posted an [opinion](https://www.justice.gov/olc/file/1232501/download) stating the ERA resolution has expired and is no longer pending before the state.    What, if any, legal precedent exist to support the pro-ERA supporters belief that the deadline does not apply? What, if any, legal precedent exist to support the Justice Department's view that the resolution has expired?
Trump so far 2020 — a special project of r/NeutralPolitics. Three years in, what have been the successes and failures of this administration? One question that gets submitted quite often on r/NeutralPolitics is some variation of:  > Objectively, how has Trump done as President?   The mods don't approve such a submissions, because under Rule A, they're overly broad. But given the repeated interest, we're putting up our own version here. We [did this last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/ainzdy/trump_so_far_a_special_project_of/) and it was well received, so we're going to try to make it an annual thing.  --------  There are many ways to judge the chief executive of any country and there's no way to come to a broad consensus on all of them. **US President Donald Trump has been in office for three years. What are the successes and failures of his administration so far?**  What we're asking for here is a review of specific actions by the Trump administration that are within the stated or implied duties of the office. This is not a question about your personal opinion of the president. Through the sum total of the responses, we're trying to form the most objective picture of this administration's various initiatives and the ways they contribute to overall governance.  Given the contentious nature of this topic (especially on Reddit), we're handling this a little differently than a standard submission. The mods here have had a chance to preview the question and some of us will be posting our own responses. The idea here is to contribute some early comments that we know are well-sourced and vetted, in the hopes that it will prevent the discussion from running off course.   Users are free to contribute as normal, but please keep our [rules on commenting](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_comment_rules) in mind before participating in the discussion. Although the topic is broad, please **be specific** in your responses. Here are some potential topics to address:  * Appointments * Campaign promises * Criminal justice * Defense * Economy * Environment * Foreign policy * Healthcare * Immigration * Rule of law * Public safety * Tax cuts * Tone of political discourse * Trade  Let's have a productive discussion about this very relevant question.
What specific acts that are alleged to have violated the ICA will the President be on trial for? Perhaps the American public is united on the impeachment trial in that mostly [we are all confused](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/17/opinion/impeachment-trump.html). I'm asking for input as to what the impeachment trial is actually about in regard to one of the Articles, the withholding of funds that may have violated the **Impoundment Control Act** (ICA).  The NY Times reported: ["*As the Senate prepared for the impeachment trial, the Government Accountability Office said the White House violated a law that limits a president’s power to withhold money allocated by Congress*."](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/16/us/politics/gao-trump-ukraine.html) This article however does not describe how the president broke the law. I am confused about what exactly the president is being impeached for so I looked up the [**Impoundment Control Act**](https://budget.house.gov/publications/report/impoundment-control-act-1974-what-it-why-does-it-matter)  * [**LINK**](https://www.gao.gov/assets/710/703909.pdf) **GAO Report** Page 8: "*CONCLUSION: OMB violated the ICA when it withheld DOD’s USAI funds from obligation for policy reasons. This impoundment of budget authority was not a programmatic delay. OMB and State have failed, as of yet to provide the information we need to fulfill our duties under the ICA regarding potential impoundments of FMF funds. We will continue to pursue this matter and will provide our decision to the Congress after we have received the necessary information,*" On the page 2 the GAO also states: "*OMB removed the footnote from the apportionment for the USAI funds on September 12, 2019.*"  1. What acts specifically will the President be on trial for that violated the ICA? Where I am confused is if the president is charged with the crime of **withholding** of the funds **or** is he being impeached with the crime of **failing "to report promptly to Congress** all withholdings of budget authority" as the [**Impoundment Control Act**](https://history.house.gov/Historical-Highlights/1951-2000/Congressional-Budget-and-Impoundment-Control-Act-of-1974/) **required**? Page 1 and 2 of the GAO Report focus upon the withholding rather than the reporting issue but Page 3 discusses an alleged failure to report to Congress. 2. What is the evidence (pro and con) that the president actually "withheld" the funds (rather than delayed disbursement, a "programmatic delay") and what is the evidence that the decision in September reversed the alleged "withholding"? 3. The GAO refers to an ongoing inter-agency process to resolve this issue. Has this process been concluded since January 16? If not, what is the evidence for postponing the impeachment trial until it is settled? 4. If the impeachment charge is not for the crime of actual withholding the funds but is for the crime of failing to "*promptly report the withholding to Congress*" **then** what is the *evidence* pro and con that he failed to report promptly? 5. Also stated:"*The ICA does not permit deferrals for policy reasons. See B-237297.3, Mar. 6, 1990; B-224882, Apr. 1, 1987.* What are these? Laws?  * The NY Times also reported: "\["*The decision to freeze the aid was directed by the president himself, and during the House impeachment inquiry, administration officials testified that they had raised concerns about its legality to no avail*."\] This suggests that it was the decision to withhold delay the aid in the criminal act that he will be tried for? * Yet [the GAO itself states](https://www.gao.gov/products/B-330330.1) that presidents may legally delay disbursement under some circumstances, * Also stated by the GAO: ["...  the Comptroller General can initiate legal proceedings to compel the release of impounded budget authority..."](https://www.gao.gov/products/106251) Did this occur, and what was the result it this happened? * [Politifact](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2019/dec/05/did-trump-violate-impoundment-control-act/) claims that the crime was the withholding of the funds.
Who breaks a tie vote in the Senate on procedural questions during the impeachment trial of the President? I am specifically asking about what happens on procedural questions during the trial (e.g. calling witnesses) if the Senate is tied 50/50 on those questions.  Conviction and removal is a 2/3 threshold where it doesn't matter.  The [US Constitution](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei) provides that:  >The Vice President of the United States shall be President of the Senate, but shall have no Vote, unless they be equally divided.  And that:  >The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside  So the Vice President is established as the President of the Senate, but the Constitution specifies that when the President is tried in an impeachment, the Chief Justice "shall preside."  Does the power of voting when the Senate is equally divided reside solely in the Vice President, or would it reside in the Chief Justice as presiding officer for the impeachment trial?  Or neither? Is a 50/50 vote just a failed vote when the Vice President cannot preside because the Chief Justice must be presiding?
Does the US constitution allow for social democracy to be implemented on a federal level in the US, if yes/no then how/why?  Bernie Sanders’ support is [equivalent](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bernie-sanders-starts-2020-in-strong-position-in-iowa-new-hampshire-cbs-news-battleground-tracker-poll/) to other front runners in the upcoming democratic primary elections. He is a [self proclaimed](https://www.vox.com/2019/6/12/18663217/bernie-sanders-democratic-socialism-speech-transcript) “democratic socialist” although [some argue](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/03/bernie-sanders-democratic-socialism/471630/) he’s rather a social democrat in a Scandinavian sense of the word.  “Social democracy is a political, social and economic philosophy that supports economic and social interventions to promote social justice within the framework of a liberal democratic polity and a capitalist-oriented economy” according to the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_democracy?wprov=sfti1) that in turn refers to Sargent, Lyman Tower (2009). Contemporary Political Ideologies: A Comparative Analysis (14th ed.). Wadsworth Publishing. p. 117.  Looking at the current United States constitution, is Bernie Sanders’ political ideas possible to implement on a federal level? Does the US constitution allow for federal interference on welfare, medical care, tax redistribution on an individual level and so on?
What are the consequences to the US Administration if their assassination of the Iranian General was not legally justified? The Trump administration arguing (in part) that they needed to assassinate General Soleimani because he presented an ["Imminent Threat"](https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/07/politics/qasem-soleimani-reasons-justifications/index.html), which gives them legal justification to attack under America's [War Powers Resolution](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/warpower.asp), and also seems to be recognized by the UN as [self defence](https://legal.un.org/counsel/Bethlehem%20-%20Self-Defense%20Article.pdf). However, a bi-partisan group of members of congress who have seen the evidence for this assassination have said that it [does not support the Imminent Threat standard](https://www.vox.com/2020/1/8/21057344/trump-congress-iran-intelligence-briefing-soleimani).  My question is this: if it turns out that there was no legal Imminent threat and the US attack was illegal, are there any consequences or any mechanisms for accountability for those who ordered the attack under either US law, or from international bodies?
Has the United States and Iran engaged in activities in an attempt to de-escalate potential conflicts after contentious events? American and Iranian relations are quite tense [following the killing of Maj. Gen Solemani](https://www.npr.org/2020/01/02/793208096/iraqi-tv-says-top-iranian-military-leader-killed-in-rocket-strikes-on-iraqi-airp). The Iranian Foreign Minister described the killing as an act of [both terrorism and war](https://www.npr.org/2020/01/07/794150712/irans-foreign-minister-u-s-strike-on-soleimani-an-act-of-terrorism-and-war) and hours later, Iranian forces [attacked](https://www.npr.org/2020/01/07/794388410/military-base-housing-u-s-troops-in-iraq-has-been-attacked) a US/Coalition base in Iraq.   This is not the first time the US has had [difficulties with](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93United_States_relations) Iran since the 1979 Iranian Revolution, yet the two countries have yet to engage in prolonged direct conflict. When looking back at the history between the two countries since the Iranian Revolution :   * Did the two countries ever engage in diplomatic activities following a contentious event in an attempt to de-escalate the situation?   * Was a formal agreement reached? If so, did both countries honor the terms of the agreement?
Could the House of Representatives reopen the impeachment inquiry and subpoena John Bolton to testify? Yesterday, January 6th, John Bolton released a statement saying he will testify if a subsequent were issued https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/01/john-bolton-impeachment-mitch-mcconnell-senate.html Now, today it appears the Senate Republicans are ready to move forward without a guarantee they'll want to hear from him  https://www.politico.com/news/2020/01/07/mcconnell-prepares-to-move-forward-on-impeachment-trial-rules-without-democrats-095537 Should the Senate decide against subpoenaing John Bolton could the House reopen their impeachment inquiry?
What are the context, precedent, and legality of America's killing of Qasem Soleimani? On January 3, an American military drone [destroyed](https://www.ibtimes.com/iran-threatens-revenge-it-mourns-guards-killed-us-2895702) a convoy near the Baghdad airport that included five members of the local militia and five officers from the Iranian military. The most notable casualty was Major General Qasem Soleimani, who commanded the Quds Force, Iran's agency for foreign military intelligence and special operations.  1. What is the recent history of escalation in the conflict between Iran and the US leading up to this attack? And what was Soleimani's involvement in actions against the US and its allies? 1. Are there similar cases in the past of the US killing foreign military leaders, or of other countries killing US military leaders, outside of wartime? What were the circumstances and consequences? 1. What US law allows the killing of military officials belonging to a state with which the US is not formally at war? Does this violate any international treaties to which the US is a party? Likewise, can Iran legally kill American military leaders?
What effect, if any, has Trump's regulation strategy had on the increasing US emissions of 2018?  I was doing some research on US progress on reducing emissions. From the ["Final US Emissions Estimates for 2018"](https://rhg.com/research/final-us-emissions-estimates-for-2018/) by Rhodium Group, 2018 saw a significant up-tick in US emissions from 2017 after 3 years of decrease. Increases were found in almost every sector: Transportation, Buildings, Power, Industry. Partial justifications for some of these increases include a colder winter--which offsets the energy savings of a cooler summer--and economic growth.  We've also seen [environmental regulations systematically removed](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/climate/trump-environment-rollbacks.html) by the Trump administration. What effect do some of these regulations changes have on our emissions if any? Consider both \[1: Increased economic growth via reduced regulative burden\] and \[2: Increased emissions due to less stringent regulation\]  In addition, I noticed a curious discrepancy between the Rhodium Group's report and the EPA's reports. The EPA website only [provides data up to 2017](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/inventory-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-and-sinks-1990-2017) and an [EPA news report](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/latest-inventory-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-and-sinks-shows-long-term-reductions) published in April, 2019 similarly provides insights only up to 2017. Rhodium group published their [Preliminary US Emissions Estimates for 2018](https://rhg.com/research/preliminary-us-emissions-estimates-for-2018/) in January, 2019. In the Rhodium report, they cite data from other independent sources--Bloomberg and Genscape--and other government agencies--EIA (U.S. Energy Information Administration) and the US Department of Transportation. Notably, the [EIA has already started publishing preliminary reports for 2019](https://www.eia.gov/coal/production/quarterly/) and the [USDT has added data for 2018](https://www.bts.gov/topics/national-transportation-statistics) separately in each independent report throughout 2019.  It seems the Rhodium Group has published an analysis years earlier than a similar EPA report will be available. Why are they able to do this? Are there trade-offs in the scope or the quality of their analyses?
What is the reason on why the Federal Government can remove funding because of certain criteria, such as the drinking age, but not others, such as sanctuary cities? It is commonly known that the federal government got states onboard with 21 and up drinking laws by threatening to withdraw federal highway funds otherwise. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK37599/  However, courts have ruled that the federal government cannot withhold law enforcement funding because of a state or city refusing to cooperate with federal immigration authorities. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-philadelphia/philadelphia-beats-us-appeal-in-sanctuary-city-case-idUSKCN1Q42BS  Why could the federal government withhold highway funding from states refusing to cooperate with 21 and up drinking laws, but it is unconstitutional for the feds to withhold funding for law enforcement because of a state or municipality refusing to cooperate with immigration authorities? Is it because states passed bills that explicitly defied the federal National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1989, instead of merely ignoring federal authorities?
John Bolton, North Korea, and the Trump White House's Successes and Failures [In an exclusive interview](https://www.axios.com/bolton-john-trump-north-korea-missiles-94088bf9-4d2d-4d10-bfd9-80db7bc36a50.html), former U.S. National Security  Advisor John Bolton told Axios that the Trump Administration should admit its approach to end North Korea’s nuclear arms program has “failed.” Bolton suggested the Trump administration is "bluffing" about stopping North Korea’s nuclear ambitions and it would be “very unusual” for this White House to say that they were wrong.  John Bolton, though, is an interesting figure himself to say the least. Bloomberg, [in their piece on how Bolton's departure could impact the President's foreign policy](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-11/john-bolton-trump-foreign-policy), described Bolton as "the most vocal hardliner [in] President Donald Trump's inner circle." Bolton's departure has also been met by favorable and affirmative statements from other government, [including that of North Korea](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-20/north-korea-praises-trump-for-ousting-troublemaker-bolton). Foreign Policy magazine went so far as to [analogize](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/10/01/john-bolton-is-ready-to-go-rogue/) the Trump-Bolton relationship with the tumultuous Reagan-Haig relationship of the 1980s. If that were the case, I'd imagine Mr. Bolton would love to criticize Mr. Trump regardless of how effectively the White House operates.  That being said, Kim Jong Un has been presenting himself to be very tough recently. Earlier this month [he inspected](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia-pacific/kim-jong-un-is-back-on-his-white-horse-as-north-korea-flags-a-big-decision/2019/12/03/7bbc9b2a-163c-11ea-80d6-d0ca7007273f_story.html) "revolutionary battle sites" around Mount Paektu, and [warned Washington](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/north-korea-warns-united-states-of-an-unwelcome-christmas-gift/2019/12/03/ad406634-1599-11ea-80d6-d0ca7007273f_story.html) that it could soon receive an "unwelcome Christmas gift," calling us all back to remember [the last thing](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/07/05/asia/north-korea-missile-nuclear-gift/index.html) North Korea described as a "gift." I'm no deterrence theorist, but that seems a bit like bolstering reputation and interest.  So, what are we supposed to believe. Is John Bolton right in saying the Trump White House is failing in North Korea, or is John Bolton merely criticizing an ex-employer? More specifically, could you give me any insights on:    - **What successes (and failures) has the Trump Administration seen in its relations with North Korea;**  - **Are those successes (and failures) significant compared to the successes of other Presidencies;**  - **Can those successes be maintained (or those failures undone) by this Administration, or are they fleeting, and;**   - **Is it reasonable to believe that another specific strategy is definitively more likely to bring about more success (or less failure)?**  Edit: removed an erroneous ")"
Is Trump officially impeached yet or not? House voted to pass articles of impeachment but has not transmitted them, correct?  My question is, simply voting to impeach constitute impeachment or must the articles be transmitted in order to go down in history as impeachment.  If they are not transmitted and impeachment dies where it is now, what is the status?  There have not been many impeachments in the past so it doesn't seem like rules are carved into stone.  [https://edition.cnn.com/2019/12/23/opinions/was-donald-trump-impeached-gerber/index.html](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/12/23/opinions/was-donald-trump-impeached-gerber/index.html)  edit:source
What are the international counterparts to the "Lemon Test" and their pros and cons? The "Lemon Test" is an American judicial test for the compliance with the Establishment Clause:  > Three ... tests may be gleaned from our cases. First, the statute must have a secular legislative purpose; second, its principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion; finally, the statute must not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion.  https://usconstitution.net/lemon.html  The test is both derived from previous cases and revised/clarified by a subsequent case. It has not been applied consistently in more recent SCOTUS cases and been criticized, with some suggesting it be replaced entirely.  https://mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/437/lemon-v-kurtzman-i  https://mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/834/lemon-test  With that in mind, what are the Lemon Test's international counterparts and what their pros and cons?
What rules, laws, or traditions are there about appointing impeachment managers and transmitting articles of impeachment to the Senate? Tonight, [Donald Trump has become the third US president in history to be impeached by the House of Representatives](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50840934).   &nbsp;  [ Normally, the next step in the impeachment process is the Senate trial.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/18/us/politics/senate-impeachment-trial.html)        &nbsp;    [House Speaker Nancy Pelosi](https://www.npr.org/2019/12/18/789062780/house-democrats-weigh-a-move-to-delay-senate-impeachment-trial),  > declined to say when she will transmit the articles of impeachment to the Senate, telling reporters she is waiting to see what process is established in the Senate for a trial.  > Pelosi told reporters Wednesday evening after the House approved a resolution with two articles of impeachment that she is waiting to determine who the "impeachment managers" will be – the prosecution team for the House Democrats' case in the Senate trial – until she sees what parameters are for the Senate trial.  &nbsp;  * **What rules, laws, or traditions are there about appointing impeachment managers and transmitting articles of impeachment to the Senate?** * **Do the articles "expire" at some point?**
What powers are vested in the Chief Justice as the presiding judge in an impeachment trial? After a president is impeached by the House, the conviction trial takes place with the Senate acting as the jury and the Chief Justice of the United States acting as the judge. As [precedent](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/506/224/) indicates, impeachment is purely a political process and not a legal one. Therefore, the rules and procedures of a traditional trial that most people are most familiar with do not exactly apply in an impeachment trial.  In fact, according to the *[Rules and Procedures of Practice in the Senate When Sitting on Impeachment Trials]( https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/resources/pdf/3_1986SenatesImpeachmentRules.pdf)*, in an impeachment trial, the “Presiding Officer shall have power to make and issue… all orders, mandates, writs, and precepts authorized by these rules or by the Senate, and to make and enforce such other regulations and orders in the premises as the Senate may authorize or provide.” In other words, as the majority party of the Senate, the GOP appears to have the power to set the rules.  Furthermore, the rules also state (bold emphasis by me):  > And the Presiding Officer on the trial may rule on all questions of evidence including, but not limited to, questions of relevancy, materiality, and redundancy  of evidence and incidental questions, which ruling shall stand as the judgment of the Senate, **unless some Member of the Senate shall ask that a formal vote be taken thereon, in which case it shall be submitted to the Senate for decision without debate**; or he may at his option, in the first instance, submit any such question to a vote of the Members of the Senate. Upon all such questions the vote shall be taken in accordance with the Standing Rules of the Senate.  And thus it seems that the Chief Justice can be overridden in their rulings if a majority of the Senate votes on it.  So what exactly are the powers vested in the Chief Justice as the presiding judge in an impeachment trial?
The controlling Scottish National Party wants to hold a referendum on Scotland leaving the UK. Boris Johnson has said he will not authorize the section 30 order allowing this vote. What other avenues does the Scottish National Party have to seek a referendum, or leave the UK? Scotland held a referendum on [leaving the United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Scottish_independence_referendum) in 2014. (Results: 44.70% Leave; 55.30% Stay)  Since then, the United Kingdom has [voted to leave the European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum), adding another layer to a potential Scottish independence vote.  In that 2016 referendum, 62% of Scottish voters chose to 'stay' in the European Union, which has been fuel for the controlling Scottish National Party to call for another referendum to leave the UK, [arguing it would allow Scotland to stay in the EU.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposed_second_Scottish_independence_referendum).  ---  The 2014 Scottish independence referendum was legally maneuvered through an [Order of Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_in_Council) under [section 30](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserved_and_excepted_matters) of the [1998 Scotland Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland_Act_1998).  The Scottish Nationalist Party [now seeks](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/13/snp-sturgeon-says-johnson-has-no-mandate-to-take-scotland-out-of-eu.html) another section 30 order to hold another referendum, however newly re-elected Prime Minister Boris Johnson's has said he will not authorize another referendum: (Last cite)   > Before the election, Johnson said he would reject any such request and as the results became clear early Friday morning, Conservative cabinet minister Michael Gove appeared to reinforce that view.  > “I don’t believe that a second independence referendum would be right for Scotland or right for the United Kingdom,” said Gove.  ---  I have a few questions on this topic:  1: Is it possible for Scotland to have another referendum through a means other than how they did it in 2014?  2: Other than a referendum, is there any other mechanism available for Scotland leaving the UK?  3: Is it a given that Scotland would be able to stay in the EU with their previous trade agreements if they voted to leave the UK?
How do the claims of the Nunes Memo and the Democratic reply memo hold up after the release of the Inspector General’s report? **How do the claims of the Nunes Memo and the Democratic reply memo hold up after the release of the Inspector General’s report?**  With the recent release of the Inspector General’s report the process in which FISA warrants were obtained against Carter Page, I feel that it’s worthwhile to re-examine the Nunes Memo and the Democrat’s reply memo (aka “Demo”). We have the benefit of two years of additional information, and the IG’s recent report gives both more and less information than we had before.  This has been a topic that has been addressed before here in this subreddit, so long-time readers may recall some of the past threads over the years.  Nunes made several claims in his Feb 2018 letter, and within a month it was [announced]( https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/inspector-general-announces-he-will-review-justice-departments-surveillance-of-former-trump-campaign-adviser/2018/03/28/23651efe-32bb-11e8-94fa-32d48460b955_story.html) that the Inspector General would be looking into the FISA warrants.   **Questions presented**  * How do Nunes’ claims hold up now that we have more information?  * How does the Democratic memo hold up? * Does the IG’s report support claims made by Nunes and/or the Democrats rebuttal?   Specifically, Nunes said that “material and relevant information was omitted,” from the FISA applications. I will try my best to summarize what Nunes claims below:  1. The initial and renewal applications did not contain information that the DNC paid for Steele’s dossier as a means to obtain derogatory information on Trump’s ties to Russia, and it does not mention that Steele was authorized payment by the FBI.  2. Furthermore, Fusion GPS’s and Perkins Coie’s roles were not disclosed despite the ties being known by the DOJ. 3. The applications cited a Yahoo News article as corroborating evidence for Steele’s work when in fact Steele leaked his information to Yahoo news. Steele should have been terminated in September but concealed his activities from the FBI. 4. Steele maintained contacts with the FBI through Bruce Ohr, and through Ohr the FBI learned that Steele was biased and that this bias did not make it into the applications or the renewals. Also, Ohr’s wife worked for Fusion GPS and both persons’ ties to Steele and Fusion GPS were concealed from the FISC. 5. Steele’s information wasn’t corroborated at the time of the initial FISA application. Deputy Director McCabe said that that without the Steele dossier, there would have not been a FISA warrant. 6. The FISA warrant mentions Papadopoulos and how it triggered a counterintelligence investigation but does not link them together in a conspiracy. 7. The Strozk/Page text messages are indications of bias.  Meanwhile, then-minority House Democrats and also made a series of claims, which I will again try my best to summarize:  1. FBI and DOJ officials did not “abuse the FISA process, omit material information, or subvert the [FISA process]" to spy on the Trump campaign 2. The DOJ used a “multi-pronged rationale” that narrowly used Steele’s information along with independent sources 3. The FBI was transparent with the FISC about Steele’s “background, credibility, and potential bias.” The Court was also informed that Steele was terminated as a source for making unauthorized disclosures. 4. The planned DOJ payment against Steele was cancelled. 5. The DOJ appropriately included Papadopoulos in the FISA application, and excluding it would have been negligent. 6. Bruce Ohr’s role was mischaracterized by the Nunes Memo. 7. Peter Strozk and Lisa Page’s text messages are irrelevant.

2019 UK General Election Megathread **I HAVE THE CONFIDENCE TO CALL A CONSERVATIVE MAJORITY OF BETWEEN 360-367 SEATS**  ---  It may seem like deja vu, but we are back with a new UK General Election, the third in five years. This is because [a snap election was called by MP's back in October](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/general-election-why-boris-johnson-brexit-vote-deal-conservatives-explained-a9201081.html) after a stalemate on the issue of Brexit - this is why it's being dubbed the 'Brexit Election.' If Boris Johnson is to win, he will be able to get Brexit deal done by the 31st.  There are all 650 seats up for grabs - that's a majority requirement of 326 seats.  Current [FT polling](https://www.ft.com/content/263615ca-d873-11e9-8f9b-77216ebe1f17) has the Conservatives at 43%, Labour at 33%. However, with the First Past the Post electoral system, it is hard to know how this will translate into actual seats.  Whatever happens, it will be monumental and set the UK on its course for the next five years - and perhaps even more if the issue of Brexit can be resolved.  You can watch the election as it happens on [BBC news](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/election-2019-50755004), or the [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/12/general-election-2019-uk-live-labour-tories-corbyn-boris-johnson-results-exit-poll). You can also watch a livestream [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Auq9mYxFEE) - with special guest, Former Speaker John Bercow.  If you have any questions about this election, please feel free to ask them. This is also an open discussion forum (No Top Level Comment Requirements), so we will be more lenient on the rules, but do not think it makes this a free for all.  **LIVE UPDATES**  ---  **21:19:** As polls enter their final hour, the first rumours of what the electoral landscape might become is leaking out. [Deputy Financial Times Editor Steven Swinford](https://twitter.com/Steven_Swinford/status/1205218026997596160) has stated that Conservative support in London's constituencies are looking "difficult", but are hoping to regain losses in the Leave-voting North of England.  **21:50:** Political Editor for the Sun Newspaper has reported that there is a [50/50 chance on a Hung Parliament/Narrow Conservative Win](https://twitter.com/tnewtondunn/status/1205242626548674563?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1205242626548674563&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fpolitics%2Flive%2F2019%2Fdec%2F12%2Fgeneral-election-2019-uk-live-labour-tories-corbyn-boris-johnson-results-exit-poll)  **22:01:** The Exit Polls have come in. The Conservatives have 368 seats, with Labour on 191. SNP have 55 seats. That's a 86 majority - Margaret Thatcher levels. If that's true, that's a phenomenal result, and gives Boris is mandate to "GET BREXIT DONE!" by the 31st of January.   These are not the final results, just a poll and should not be trusted completely. There is still a lot that can change.  **22:27:** Where does this leave Labour under Jeremy Corbyn? This is the worst result for Labour since 1935. There are already calls for him to resign, however his shadow cabinet are standing by him - for now.  **22:29:**[ If the 55 out of 58 SNP seats in Scotland](https://twitter.com/theSNP/status/1205246386846994441?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet) is to be believed, just one shy of their all-time high in 2015, and a 20 seat gain, this will put Scotland at odds with Westminster. A hard right, Leave Conservative government would be clashing with a Remain voting Scottish Nationalist government up north - putting the state of the Union in even more jeopardy. Scotland would want a 2nd Independence Referendum, and claimed this election would give them a mandate to have one, however the Conservatives have put any notion of one away.  **22:42:** The Guardian are reporting that the exit polls suggest that Liberal Democrats leader Jo Swinson is set to lose her seat in East Dumbartonshire, Scotland.  **22:46:** [The Pound has climbed against the Dollar](https://news.sky.com/story/general-election-pound-wins-as-exit-poll-predicts-big-tory-majority-11884813) and the Euro by almost as much as 5 cents as the exit polls came in, citing stability in the UK political climate and a clearer future. This may also harm the attack that many Remainers used that leaving the EU would harm the UK economy.  **23:17:** Labour's heartlands in the Midlands - the so called Red Wall - is apparently swinging hard to the Conservatives, which is where many of these gains are likely to come from.  **23:26** The traditional race to get the first results are in from Newcastle Central. The results are Con: 9,290  Lab: 21,568 Lib: 2709 Green: 1,365 BXP: 2542. This seat was a Leave voting seat, but the Labour candidate was re-elected by a majority of over 12,000, but this is a 7% loss from 2017.  **23:34** In Sunderland South, Labour lost [18% of votes](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/E14000754), and Blyth swung from Labour to Tory after they lost [15% of votes](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/E14000575). These are all traditional Labour seats - and many were narrow vote Leave seats.  **00:32**[ Swindon North hold for Conservatives](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/E14000851). Doubled Labour's vote. Labour are down 8% here.  **01:03** A Labour seat that they won by over 10k votes in 2017 has [gone to a recount](https://twitter.com/SamCoatesSky/status/1205289992840458241?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1205289992840458241&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fpolitics%2Flive%2F2019%2Fdec%2F12%2Fgeneral-election-2019-uk-live-labour-tories-corbyn-boris-johnson-results-exit-poll). This does not look good for the Labour Party.  **01:40** So far, Conservatives have gained 3 seats, SNP gained 1 seat, and Labour have lost 4 seats. We have only just begun. However, if these numbers are to be believed, the Exit Poll seems to be more or less accurate.  **02:03:** The first Labour gain has come in from Putney. The gain [has given Labour a 6% lead](https://twitter.com/britainelects/status/1205304811979182080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1205304811979182080&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fpolitics%2Flive%2F2019%2Fdec%2F12%2Fgeneral-election-2019-uk-live-labour-tories-corbyn-boris-johnson-results-exit-poll). This is a London seat and was expected to swing to Labour.  **02:32:** Results so far - 52 Conservatives, 47 Labour, 7 Scottish Nationalists, 1 Liberal Democrats, 5 "OTHERS".  **02:46:** Results so far - 78 Con, 68 Lab, 13 SNP, 1 Lib Dem, 5 "Others"  Currently, Labour has lost, on average, a share of votes of around 10%. This is almost historic. Most swings are between 2-4%. Tony Blair only surpassed this with a 15% swing in favour in 1998  **02:58** Chuka Unama, a former Conservative who joined the Liberal Democrats, [has lost his seat to the Conservaitves.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/E14000639) This comes after both Labour and Liberal Democrats - a self proclaimed Remain alliance - ended up splitting the vote. If they voted tactically, they would have won by more than 6k votes.  **03:09:** DUP's Deputy Leader, Nigel Dodds, has lost [his seat to Sinn Fein](https://www.itv.com/news/utv/2019-12-13/live-counting-underway-at-centres-across-ni/)  **03:19:** Liberal Democrats [gained a Conservative seat, the first of the night](https://twitter.com/britainelects/status/1205325042067935232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1205325042067935232&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fpolitics%2Flive%2F2019%2Fdec%2F12%2Fgeneral-election-2019-uk-live-labour-tories-corbyn-boris-johnson-results-exit-poll)  **03:35** It is expected that Jeremy Corbyn is going to stand down after this election, after stating that he "will not lead the Labour Party into another General Election"  **03:52** Jo Swinson, leader of the Liberal Democrats, has lost [her seat to the SNP by just over 100 seats](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50771123). It will be expected for her to resign, and a new leader to be elected - the fourth in the past 2 years.   **I AM NOW ENDING THIS MEGATHREAD'S UPDATES. THERE IS UNLIKELY TO BE ANY MORE NOTEWORTHY NEWS. A CONSERVATIVE MAJORITY IS ALMOST GUARANTEED, OF BETWEEN 360-367, WHICH GIVES BORIS JOHNSON A WORKING MAJORITY OF OVER 60 VOTES. THIS IS A SHOCK TO THE UK POLITICAL LANDSCAPE, AND THERE WILL BE MORE QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS. THANK YOU ALL FOR TAKING PART. GOOD NIGHT. GOD SPEED**
Are the allegations in the articles of impeachment released today factually and legally supported? Today House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Judiciary Committee Chairman Nadler [announced](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/10/us/politics/trump-impeachment-articles.html) the introduction of articles of ompeachment against President Donald Trump.  [Those articles of impeachment are available here.](https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/democrats.judiciary.house.gov/files/documents/Articles%20of%20Impeachment.pdf) (PDF)  There are two articles.  I will briefly excerpt the core allegations from each:  * **Article I: Abuse of Power**  >Using the powers of his high office, President Trump solicited the interference of a foreign government, Ukraine, in the 2020 United States Presidential election. He did so through a scheme or course of conduct that included soliciting the Government of Ukraine to publicly announce investigations that would benefit his reelection, harm the election prospects of a political opponents, and influence the 2020 United States Presidential election to his advantage. President Trump also sought to pressure the Government of Ukraine to take these steps by conditioning official United States Government acts of significant value to Ukraine on its public announcement of the investigations. President Trump engage in this scheme or course of conduct for corrupt purposes in pursuit of personal political benefit. In so doing, President Trump used the powers of the Presidency in a manner that compromised the national security of the United States and undermined the integrity of the United States democratic process.  He thus ignored and injured the interests of the Nation.  * **Article II: Obstruction of Congress**  >The House of Representatives has engaged in an impeachment inquiry focused on President Trump's corrupt solicitation of the Government of Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 United States Presidential election. As part of this impeachment inquiry, the Committees undertaking the investigation served subpoenas seeking documents and testimony deemed vital to the inquiry from various Executive Branch agencies and offices, and current and former officials.    >In response, without lawful cause or excuse, President Trump directed Executive Branch agencies, offices, and officials not to comply with those subpoenas. President Trump thus interposed the powers of the Presidency against the lawful subpoenas of the House of Representatives, and assumed to himself the functions and judgments necessary to the exercise of the "sole Power of Impeachment" vested by the Constitution in the House of Representatives.  The articles then proceed to describe the means by which the alleged actions were undertaken.      *  Are the factual claims in the two articles of impeachment supported by evidence from testimony, documentation, or other sources?  Is there any countervailing evidence that shows them to be in doubt?  * Are the legal claims in the two articles of impeachment accurate? Do they comport with past cases of impeachment, criminal law, or other sources of law?  --- Mod footnote: I am submitting this on behalf of the mod team because of the very high level of interest in the subject.  We will be very strictly moderating the comments here, especially concerning not allowing offtopic comments or unsourced or unsubstantiated speculation.
What are the costs and benefits of means-testing college funding vs. universal higher education for students? Recently, [AOC and Pete Buttigieg have clashed over the implementation of funding higher education for students](https://mobile.twitter.com/AOC/status/1200261361391017984), with AOC advocating for universal higher education, while Buttigieg has argued for means-testing to fund college for families under a certain income.   That said, my question is simply what are the costs and benefits of means-tested (as in a plan like [Buttigieg's](https://peteforamerica.com/policies/higher-education/)) vs. universal (like [Sanders' plan](https://berniesanders.com/en/issues/free-college-cancel-debt/)) tuition-free college?
The US Constitution Article 1 Section 3 appears to have a disqualification clause, in addition to and separate from conviction, possibly not requiring the extra hurdle of a 2/3rds majority. Could this be used in the impeachment of Donald Trump? Speaking of the powers and duties of the Senate, the [US Constitution Article 1 Section 3 states](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript#toc-section-3-):  > Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, **and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States**: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.   [Justia provides some further background](https://law.justia.com/constitution/us/article-2/49-judgment-removal-and-disqualification.html), speaking of the link between conviction and removal:  > the Senate determined that removal is automatic upon conviction, and does not require a separate vote... only as a result of a two-thirds vote.  it further states for disqualification:  > **Unlike removal, disqualification from office is a discretionary judgment, and there is no explicit constitutional linkage to the two-thirds vote on conviction. Although an argument can be made that disqualification should nonetheless require a two-thirds vote, the Senate has determined that disqualification may be accomplished by a simple majority vote**  Many seem to think it unlikely that enough Republicans in the Senate will break rank from the party and vote in favor of convicting Donald Trump for anything. However, should disqualification be brought to the table, it may only require a simple majority and therefore only 4 Republican Senators to break party rank.  * How does disqualification get proposed? * When has disqualification been used separate from conviction in the past? * Are Democrats aware of/think disqualification would be a viable strategy? * Would successful disqualification actually prevent Donald Trump from running for reelection? * What is the role of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell? For example, like other actions in the Senate, can he choose if disqualification can get brought to the floor for vote during impeachment?
Is there any historical precedence for an Attorney General not agreeing with the findings of his own ordered investigation? It's being reported that AG Barr doesn’t accept a key inspector general finding about FBI’s Russia investigation https://a.msn.com/r/2/BBXFJKW  My understanding is that the investigation began under Barr's direction, is that correct? How can the subordinate reach a conclusion the boss is completely at odds with and allow that division to become public? What are AG Barr's options if he disagrees with the report?
What, if any, are the disputed questions of fact between the Majority and Minority impeachment reports? Yesterday afternoon, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence released its 300 page report on President Trump's conduct in respect to Ukraine as part of the [impeachment inquiry authorized by the House of Representatives.](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-resolution/660)  The day before, Republicans on the committee released their own report on the same subject.  Do the dueling reports contain material differences on questions of fact?  Or are they just different views on the same basic underlying facts?  Does either report contain major factual inaccuracies?  * [House Intelligence Committee Majority Report](https://intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/20191203_-_full_report___hpsci_impeachment_inquiry_-_20191203.pdf)  * [House Intelligence Committee Minority Report](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6564792-HouseGOP-Report.html#document/p1)  (PDF warning on the above links.  The majority report is 300 pages; the minority report is 123 pages)
What are the pros and cons to an open US-Mexico Border? I tried looking this up, but most articles on the subject are heavily biased.  I've seen some argue about terrorists traveling across the border, with others countering that there is a lack of evidence to support this fear ([link](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/01/14/guide-understanding-administrations-spin-terrorists-border/)).  Some claim there would be a benefit to the GDP/economy ([link](https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2018/08/06/open-borders-economy-workers)), with others countering that the overall economic drain exceeds the economic benefit ([link](https://www.heritage.org/immigration/report/the-fiscal-cost-unlawful-immigrants-and-amnesty-the-us-taxpayer)) and then others countering back on the speculative nature of the prediction ([link](https://www.factcheck.org/2013/06/the-immigration-bills-6-3-trillion-price-tag-2/)).
What are the House and Senate full body rule as relates to Anonymous/Private binding and non-binding votes related to the Impeachment? IE What are the strict legal vs political limits to Anonymous votes? I came across a quote by Jeff Flake in news articles around September  EG This one - [USA Today - "At least 35 Senators would vote to Remove Trump if Vote was Private](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/09/27/jeff-flake-at-least-35-gop-senators-would-impeach-trump/3792866002/)" , (if you google "Flake 35 Senators" you can find many others quoting the same event and giving different analysis about why the Republicans in Congress are cowed by the president.)  To paraphrase he said that "35 Senators would vote to remove Trump if the Senate vote could be held 'in private'". But in some of the articles he is either quoted as saying, or the articles clarify that "This is not possible". Why?  Upon further research I found this [Politico Magazine Article which argues that in fact the Senate Rules CAN allow for the final verdict vote (the one that really matters) to be cast in secret, just like a normal Jury vote.](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/11/12/path-to-removing-donald-trump-from-office-229911)  **TLDR: So what is the deal exactly? Can the Senate have a private vote to Convict the President? What about the House, for that matter, to pass the Impeachment Vote and pick up Republican members of the House? Are there different rules for private Binding vs Non-Binding resolutions as relate to "impeachment"?**  So I know enough to know the House "indicts" the president by impeaching him and the Senate "convicts" so this is at least two questions.  1. What are the normal restrictions on the House or Senate rules for anonymous/private votes and how would the apply for the actual Impeachment and Conviction? Is this a constitutional or legal restraint or just a political or "Norms" one for the binding votes? 2.  Even if the Senate cannot convict on private votes, given the hypothetical circumstances of a runaway Executive Branch, would it make sense for the House to call for a body wide anonymous vote?  Even if it is non-binding, just showing support and legitimacy of the "Impeachment Process" and proceedings before it is passed to the Senate? Is THAT possible by rule? Basically allow lawmakers to show whether they believe the President is acting against the constitution, but the vote being private allows them cover to vote their conscience without the public blow-back.
The Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Acts, what now, what then? The Congress and President of the United States of America have recently passed and signed into law the Hong Kong human rights and democracy act. This is a big thing over here.  The Chinese Communist Party of the People’s Republic of China has not been turning a blind eye to this, of course. Since the discussion of the bill China [responded that the bill "fully reveals the ill intentions of some people in the United States to mess up Hong Kong and contain China's development.](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3030403/beijing-vows-retaliate-after-us-hong-kong-human-rights-bill). After the House passed the Act, Beijing condemned the move and said [it would take countermeasures](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3033266/china-warns-countermeasures-over-us-bill-supporting-hong-kong) and today after the bill was signed it reiterated that [China will take firm countermeasures](https://mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN1Y204Z) in response.  I might have a political bias but to would like to stay focused on factual and legal discussions. I raise the following question/discussion points.  1. The Chinese Communist Party claims the bill is a “serious interference in Chinese affairs.” Is there any legal basis for that statement, or are there any legal definition which defines what is interfering in a country’s internal affairs?  2. The bill is triggered by the massive ongoing unrest in Hong Kong. China [claims the protests in Hong Kong is fuelled to a large extent by “foreign interference”](https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/short-reads/article/3031240/decrying-foreign-interference-china-should) What are, if any, some evidence that the protests are actually a result of foreign interferences?  2. This is not the first time the Chinese Communist Party has raised a finger and told others not to interfere in their internal affairs. Some exhibits [here](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/1938622/stop-interfering-hong-kong-affairs-beijing-warns-european), and [here](https://www.cityam.com/top-mp-denies-british-interference-in-hong-kong-after-chinese-ambassadors-warning/amp/). Is there any evidence that the People’s Republic of China under ‘foreign interferences’, or if there’s none, why are they claiming that so often?  3. A little speculative question but I believe it can be answered factually: China has warned US of ‘firm countermeasures’. Without jumping into speculations, what are the current tools and cars on the table that the Chinese Communist Party can use as countermeasures in what they view as interference from a hostile foreign nation?  Thank you!
Can Congress subpoena internet/telecom companies for the emails, text messages, Web searches, etc. of executive branch officials who are not complying with their own subpoenas? In a [discussion between two former prosecutors](https://cafe.com/stay-tuned-impeachment-special-2/) ([transcript here](https://cafe.com/stay-tuned-impeachment-hearings-with-anne-milgram//)) about the Congressional testimony of Gordon Sondland, whose past awareness or unawareness of a link between Burisma and Joe Biden is [a subject of controversy](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/holmes-hill-testimony-biden-burisma), one of them imagined:  > Look, this is one of those moments where I think you and I probably both wish we had subpoena power, because I would just subpoena his Google searches.  Given that some high-level Trump administration officials are [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/25/us/politics/private-email-trump-kushner-bannon.html) to use private email servers for official business, and given that [text messages](https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/03/politics/chairs-on-volker/index.html) have made up much of the documentary evidence in the impeachment investigation, I'm wondering whether Congress can bypass the ongoing fight over the administration's [refusal to comply with subpoenas](https://apnews.com/4bde10e62e204c50a014eef51f06361b) by subpoenaing some information from third-party internet and telecommunications companies that might hold relevant data, such as email, text messages, and Web search history.  A few specific questions:  * What is the precedent for a Congressional investigation to subpoena documents from an internet/telecom company that stores them rather than from the person they belong to? * Can Congress issue a broad subpoena to a company asking for all data from a government official's personal accounts that might be relevant to their investigation? If so, is the company obligated to sort through all of the official's personal accounts and decide which documents are responsive to the request? * If a company possesses confidential messages between members of the executive branch, is it obligated to protect executive privilege? * What specific kinds of data from which specific people are relevant to the impeachment investigation?
How feasible and concrete is the costing of the Labour Manifesto for the coming UK General Election? > Our manifesto is the most radical, hopeful, people-focused, fully-costed plan in modern times.  This is the description that Labour provide for [their manifesto](https://labour.org.uk/manifesto/), which calls for a number of rather large investments by the government, from "bringing our energy and water systems into democratic public ownership", to the building of 9,000 wind turbines and an equivalently large amount of solar power, to 4.3% more spending on health services per year.   --  > We will pay for this by creating a fairer taxation system, asking for a little more from those with the broadest shoulders, and making sure that everyone pays what they owe.     We will reverse some of the Tories’ cuts to corporation tax while keeping rates lower than in 2010.     We’ll ask those who earn more than £80,000 a year to pay a little more income tax, while freezing National Insurance and income tax rates for everyone else. *[source: 'Funding' subsection of 'Rebuild our Public Services']*  This is the closest thing that I could find to an actual guide of how they fund their manifesto, aside from some mentions of taxes levied on companies in particular cases, such as "a windfall tax on oil companies" to fund their climate policies (p.15).   These statements don't include specific new tax rates, so I am curious to know: how fully and numerically has the manifesto been costed? Can concrete funding be expected from a manifesto?
In the Senate impeachment trial, are subpoena-defying witnesses like Bolton, Giuliani, Pompeo, Perry and Mulvaney more or less likely to testify because of trial rules? Would there still need to be a lengthy legal challenge or could the Chief Justice simply order them to testify? The Constitution is famously laconic when it comes to the rules of an impeachment trial. Cited here:  >[Article I, Section 3, Clauses 6 and 7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_One_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Clause_6:_Trial_of_Impeachment) provides:   >   >The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two-thirds of the Members present.  According to the Constitution, the [Chief Justice John Roberts](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/senate-impeachment-trial-to-test-chief-justice-who-has-tangled-with-trump/2019/11/05/1c220a7e-fb3e-11e9-ac8c-8eced29ca6ef_story.html) will "preside" over the trial, but it gives no detail about what powers are entailed to him.  My question explicitly involves evidence and witnesses. I'm wondering, what do we know about how the Senate impeachment trial might work with regards to evidence and witness testimony? Who has the power to compel witness testimony or the turning over of material evidence and with what force?  While the Chief Justice "presides," it's not clear to me what that power consists in, nor who has the power to compel witnesses or evidence.  This article suggests that [A Tactical Edge Will Shift to GOP in Senate Trial](https://apnews.com/227149e8403744bf87261f4c9a06f002), where they would be able to call witnesses like Hunter and Joe Biden.  Here are some relevant quotes from the [Rules of Procedure and Practice in the Senate When Sitting on Impeachment Trials](https://www.law.cornell.edu/background/impeach/senaterules.pdf)  Section II references the "Presiding Officer of the Senate," who announces the impeachment and swears in the senators.  Section IV states that in the case of the impeachment of a President or Vice President, as opposed to a judge or some other official, the "Chief Justice of the United States shall preside." Furthermore, the Chief Justice "shall be administered an oath by the Presiding Officer of the Senate."  Section V dictates that the "Presiding Officer shall have power to make and issue...all orders, mandates, writs and precepts..."  Section VI then broadens the power to compel witnesses to the entire Senate: "Senate shall have power to compel the attendance of witnesses, to enforce obedience to its orders, mandates, writs, precepts and judgments..."   What I'm trying to figure out is what power does Roberts have here as the Presiding Officer on the trial, what powers would McConnell or Pence have as the Presiding Officer on the Senate, and what powers would the Senate as a whole have?
Is there precedence for members of Congress to recuse themselves from hearings in which they have conflicts of interest? Are members of Congress required to recuse themselves from investigatory or trial matters in which they have a potential conflict of interest, or in the absence of a law or rule requiring as such, is there precedent for such actions? Do other countries have laws for the avoidance of conflicts of interest by legislative bodies in their investigative or trial roles?   There are currently Conflict of Interest rules in the [Senate](https://www.ethics.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/conflictsofinterest) and [House of Representatives](https://ethics.house.gov/financial-dislosure/policies-underlying-disclosure) for the disclosure and avoidance of fiduciary conflicts of interest.   As a recent example, Representative Nunes, the minority chair of the House Intelligence Committee, has been reported to [have connections to Lev Parnas](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4832774/user-clip-rep-eric-swalwell-calls-rep-devin-nunes-lev-parnas-connection). [Lev Parnas is currently under criminal indictment](https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/u-s-vs-lev-parnas-et-al-indicment/12ab2d62-230f-4e38-8f1a-b6221ee48876/), and is deeply involved in the Ukraine scandal. It has been proposed that Nunes's connection to Parnas represents a conflict of interest in Nunes's investigatory role in the impeachment hearings.   Another recent example is [Senator Ron Johnson, who is a witness with regards to incidents in the Ukraine affair](https://apnews.com/fc2821213aa64724b0086e7f0fdafff7), but would also potentially serve as a 'juror' in a Senate trial of President Trump.

What would be the pros and cons of transferring all current public, government run roads, into the hands of private ownership? [Private roads, otherwise known as free-market roads,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-market_roads) is a system of roads that are owned entirely by private companies and entities.  According to Freedom Economic Education, they claim that [free market roads would help end congestion](https://fee.org/articles/privately-owned-roads-would-end-congestion/). Advocates also reflect back to the early days of America's expansion, and how many of the roads were [private, thus helping fuel development and investment.](https://www.accessmagazine.org/spring-1993/private-toll-roads-in-america-the-first-time-around/)  However, other reports claim that [private roads would increase costs through tolls, spiking during "peak hours" like those done on the London Underground and Uber](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-02-07/privatizing-roads-was-a-great-idea-not-anymore), and [fail to maintain road condition.](https://www.accessmagazine.org/spring-1993/private-toll-roads-in-america-the-first-time-around/)   ***  Have there been examples in the past, or in other countries, where all (or a majority) of roads were privately owned?   In countries that have vast private road system, was there a decrease or increase of cost on consumers of the road?  Would limiting people's access to travel under burden of cost, be a violation of any human rights?
Does the British exit from the European Union represent a constitutional crisis? The British constitution is not a constitution in the normal sense; it's not codified into one document like those of most modern states, which makes the United Kingdom a very flexible entity.  It's best described as an amalgamation of social consensus, political conventions, precedent and statutes going back to the Magna Charta of 1215.^[1](https://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/articles/magna-carta-an-introduction)  "Brexit" is challenging many of the long-held conventions and norms that sustain the British state; among them are^[2](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/18/brexit-is-destroying-britains-constitution/):  (1) Parliamentary sovereignty is the notion that Parliament (the House of Commons, the House of Lords and the Monarch through his or her representative in Parliament) has  "...the right to make or unmake any law whatever: and, further, that no person or body is recognized by the law of England as having a right to override or set aside the legislation of Parliament."^[3](https://legalresearch.blogs.bris.ac.uk/2017/12/the-models-of-parliamentary-sovereignty/)  Furthermore, "...It is often said that it would be unconstitutional for the United Kingdom Parliament to do certain things, meaning that the moral, political and other reasons against doing them are so strong that most people would regard it as highly improper if Parliament did these things. But that does not mean that it is beyond the power of Parliament to do such things. If Parliament chose to do any of them, the courts would not hold the Act of Parliament invalid."^[4](http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/format.cgi?doc=/uk/cases/UKPC/1968/1968_18.html)  (2) There's also a clash between direct democracy (popular sovereignty) and the aforementioned parliamentary sovereignty.^[5](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/how-brexit-has-unleashed-a-uk-constitutional-crisis/2019/09/27/f363f54e-e138-11e9-be7f-4cc85017c36f_story.html)  Brexit was decided via referendum, and countries with written constitutions tend to set the parameters around plebiscites; however, this is not the case for the UK, so is Parliament legally required to carry out the people's will?
Trump has published several edited accounts of phone calls with Ukraine. Do these constitute formal evidence either legally, or procedurally for Congress, given the fact that they are 1. self-reported 2. not under oath 3. explicitly labeled "rough" and explicitly edited? [Deputy White House press secretary Hogan Gidley \[described\] President Trump's release of rough transcripts of his calls with the Ukrainian  president \[by\] saying he did it "so that every American can see he did nothing wrong."](https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/impeachment-hearing-11-15-19/h_71690fc565843639769bced94bc994be)  These notes are statements made while not under oath, are self-reports of matters which are in dispute and are explicitly noted "rough" and acknowledged as [modified by the same party they concern](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/10/rough-transcript-trump-call-zelensky-cover-up-ukraine-impeachment.html).  Have similar self-reported and self-edited statements historically been used either in a court of law or in non-legal deliberation by Congress?
In the United States, what legal barriers exist that prevent the implementation of ranked choice voting for presidential candidates? [Ranked Choice Voting](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/11/us/maine-ranked-choice-voting.html), as stated by [Ballotpedia](https://ballotpedia.org/Ranked-choice_voting_(RCV), is:  >an electoral system in which voters rank candidates by preference on their ballots. If a candidate wins a majority of first-preference votes, he or she is declared the winner. If no candidate wins a majority of first-preference votes, the candidate with the fewest first-preference votes is eliminated. First-preference votes cast for the failed candidate are eliminated, lifting the second-preference choices indicated on those ballots. A new tally is conducted to determine whether any candidate has won a majority of the adjusted votes. The process is repeated until a candidate wins an outright majority. This system is sometimes referred to as an instant runoff voting system.  While a majority of states in the United States do not have ranked choice voting, [5 states use RCV for presidential nominations and 1 state uses it for all non-presidential elections](https://www.fairvote.org/where_is_ranked_choice_voting_used).   As seen from the above source, many states have different levels that RCV is implemented, whether that be only for primaries or local elections. Significantly less states allow RCV for presidential elections. What legal barriers, if any, exist that prevent other states from implementing the ranked choice system for presidential candidates?
Do President Trump's actions in respect to Ukraine constitute criminal bribery? Recently there have been accusations from Rep. [Jackie Speier](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/469784-speier-says-impeachment-inquiry-shows-very-strong-case-of-bribery) and the Washington Post's [Eugene Robinson](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/call-trumps-crime-what-it-is-bribery/2019/11/07/58903c60-01a1-11ea-8501-2a7123a38c58_story.html) that President Trump's conduct in respect to Ukraine constitutes the crime of bribery.  Both of them cite the withholding of approximately $400 million in military aid from Ukraine unless Ukraine announced an investigation of Joe Biden, a current [frontrunner](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-primaries/democratic/national/) for the Democratic presidential nomination.  Robinson particularly cites to 18 USC § 201(b) which says, in relevant part:  >Whoever... being a public official or person selected to be a public official, directly or indirectly, corruptly demands, seeks, receives, accepts, or agrees to receive or accept anything of value personally or for any other person or entity, in return for:  >>(A)being influenced in the performance of any official act; ...  >shall be fined under this title or not more than three times the monetary equivalent of the thing of value, whichever is greater, or imprisoned for not more than fifteen years, or both, and may be disqualified from holding any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States.  In contrast, Rep. [Andy Biggs](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/rep-andy-biggs-lipstick-impeachment) has argued "there is no specific 'high crime' or 'misdemeanor' committed by the president."

What are the ethics, law, and precedent around unmasking anonymous people who allegedly oppose the US President? Currently there are several controversies about anonymous people who have, in various ways, been construed as opponents of the US President:  # The Ukraine whistleblower  The ongoing [Trump–Ukraine scandal and impeachment inquiry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump–Ukraine_scandal) first came to light when an unnamed CIA officer [filed a whistleblower complaint with the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-whistleblower-idUSKBN1WB0E5). Although the complaint was secondhand information and has now been [corroborated by more direct evidence](https://www.npr.org/2019/11/09/776173492/the-whistleblower-complaint-has-largely-been-corroborated-heres-how), the President has [called](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/21/impeachment-trump-says-ukraine-whistleblower-should-identified/4053046002/) for public identification of the whistleblower and assessment of his credibility. For example, the president's son [tweeted](https://www.msn.com/en-xl/northamerica/top-stories/impeachment-trumps-son-tweets-name-of-alleged-whistleblower/ar-AAJX7Ee) a Breitbart article containing the name of someone suspected of being the whistleblower, and a false misidentification of the whistleblower [circulated on social media](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trumpkins-thought-this-man-was-the-whistleblower-they-were-wrong) although that person did not work in the government at the time. Republican members of the House of Representatives [reportedly](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/in-impeachment-inquiry-republican-lawmakers-ask-questions-about-whistleblower-loyalty-to-trump-and-conspiracy-theories/2019/10/26/bf733450-f760-11e9-a285-882a8e386a96_story.html) used their questioning in recent closed-door hearings to identify the whistleblower. Senator Rand Paul, a libertarian-aligned Republican, [called on the media](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/11/04/rand-paul-demands-media-reveal-whistleblowers-name-do-your-job/4162211002/) to publish the alleged identity of the whistleblower.  # The anonymous op-ed and book author  Last year a "senior administration official" [published](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/opinion/trump-white-house-anonymous-resistance.html) an op-ed in the New York Times calling out mismanagement and dysfunction in the Trump administration, and is back in the news with [an excerpt](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/book-by-anonymous-describes-trump-as-cruel-inept-and-a-danger-to-the-nation/2019/11/07/b6b6c6f2-0150-11ea-8bab-0fc209e065a8_story.html) from a forthcoming book. The President [demanded](https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/05/politics/nyt-trump-resistance-op-ed/index.html) that the Times "must, for National Security purposes, turn him/her over to government at once!", calling the op-ed ["TREASON?"](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1037464177269514240). Sen. Rand Paul [proposed](https://www.newsweek.com/rand-paul-trump-lie-detector-tests-trump-1110033) that the White House should use polygraph tests to ferret out the author.  # The alleged Roger Stone juror  The President's sometime adviser Roger Stone is [currently on trial](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/comedian-takes-stage-trial-trump-adviser-roger-stone/story?id=66854483) for alleged lying to Congress and witness tampering in Robert Mueller's investigation of his alleged role as the intermediary between the Trump 2016 campaign and Wikileaks regarding the release of DNC emails hacked by the Russian government. His fellow InfoWars host Alex Jones [broadcasted](https://www.thedailybeast.com/alex-jones-goes-on-tirade-against-roger-stone-jurors) the name and face of a woman he claimed was a juror in the trial and also a former employee of the Obama administration, although he reportedly misidentified the woman and she was not empaneled on the final jury anyway.  ---  All three of these people remain anonymous in the mainstream media and might be subject to political retaliation if exposed. However, they have all been accused of prejudice against the President and using their anonymity as a shield to cover their unfair attacks against him.  To what extent is their anonymity protected by ethical standards, legal statute, and prior precedent? In particular, what consequences can people in different positions face for exposing their identities and how are those consequences enforced? Do journalists, members of Congress, or the President have ways of broadcasting these identities with special immunity from the consequences that would normally fall upon private citizens?
Is life currently more economically difficult for millenials than baby boomers? Several recent articles have speculated that baby boomers dying will decrease [housing values](https://www.washingtonpost.com/realestate/housing-values-may-fall-as-baby-boomers-die-off-or-sell-off-two-studies-say/2018/07/17/35b0dbf0-890c-11e8-8aea-86e88ae760d8_story.html), [political polarization](https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/465558-good-riddance-the-last-gasp-of-baby-boomer-politics), and will increase [job openings](https://twentytwowords.com/baby-boomers-dont-understand-millennial-job-market/).   Recently, Chlöe Swarbrick wrote an [article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2019/nov/09/my-ok-boomer-comment-in-parliament-symbolised-exhaustion-of-multiple-generations) about her "OK boomer" comment which said:   > My “OK boomer” comment in parliament was off-the-cuff, albeit symbolic of the collective exhaustion of multiple generations set to inherit ever-amplifying problems in an ever-diminishing window of time. It was a response – as is par-for-course – to a barrage of heckling in a Parliamentary Chamber that at present turns far too many regular folks off from engaging in politics.   How far is this true? Are there currently large political differences between Millenials born between the years 1981 and 1996 and boomers born between 1944 and 1964? If there are, are they caused by economic differences between the groups?
When have countries or local governments activated Continuity of Governance plans? During the cold war, many countries established Continuity of Governance plans in case criticial infrastructure was taken out by a foreign invasion (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_of_government). Some want to extend this to natural disasters. For example, Washington State voters seem to have approved just that (some votes are still being counted) https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/election-results-2019-senate-joint-resolution-8200-constitutional-amendment-disaster-earthquake-planning-washington-state/. Famously, the US activated it's COG plan in the aftermath of the 911 attacks (https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-shadow-government/). Supporters say that COG plans ensure that governments are able to respond effectively after major attacks or disasters. However, COG plans are controversial because they often more grant power to surviving government officials (Seattle Times article). There are also issues around transparancy (https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2007/07/defazio_demands_access_to_clas.html). What other historical instances of COG plans being put into practice are there? How did they turn out?
Have their been any instances where a recount has resulted in the preliminary outcome of an election being changed? The Kentucky Governor's election this week resulted in a close unofficial result with less than .5% of the votes (~5,189 out of 1.443M cast) difference between two candidates. The candidate with fewer votes, Matt Bevin, has asked for a 'recanvas' of the election. This is a pre-cursor to a potential recount.  Have their been any instances where a recount has resulted in the preliminary outcome of an election being changed?  Unofficial results:  https://results.enr.clarityelections.com/KY/97213/web/#/summary  Recanvas Request: https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/2019/11/06/kentucky-governor-race-matt-bevin-campaign-requests-recanvass/2510081001/
Is there a complete transcript of President Trump's call with Ukrainian President Zelensky? The current [impeachment inquiry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_inquiry_against_Donald_Trump) in the US House of Representatives was prompted by a [whistleblower complaint](https://apps.npr.org/documents/document.html?id=6430359-Whistleblower-Complaint) about a July 25th phone call between US President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy. Within the complaint is an allegation that:  > …senior White House officials had intervened to "lock down" all records of the phone call, especially the official word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced—as is customary—by the White House Situation Room.  In response, the White House released a ["memorandum of telephone conversation"](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/09/25/trump-ukraine-phone-call-transcript-text-pdf-1510770) for the call. It is formatted like a transcript and President Trump has [repeatedly referred to it as such,](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1189026689860489216) however, Congressional [testimony from a witness who was on the call](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/29/us/politics/alexander-vindman-trump-ukraine.html) indicates it may not be complete:  > Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council, told House impeachment investigators on Tuesday that the White House transcript of a July call between President Trump and Ukraine’s president omitted crucial words and phrases, and that his attempts to include them failed, according to three people familiar with the testimony.   The White House [disputes Vindman's claims](https://apnews.com/401efdc06a334f4a87365eb9b3107af4) of attempts to adjust the transcript. That same article directly implies there's no audio recording of the call and that the transcript is constructed from the notes of the various people listening in.  This all prompts a number of questions:  * Is a presidential administration legally required to make a complete transcript for any such call between the president and foreign leaders? * If so, what is that document called? Is it an "official word-for-word transcript" (per the whistleblower's complaint) or a "memorandum of telephone conversation" (as released by the White House), or are those the same thing? * If they're not the same thing, is there a procedure by which the public can gain access to the former?

With regard to the Trump-Ukraine whistleblower complaint and the presidential impeachment process, from a legal/constitutional perspective, does the identity of the whistleblower matter, or only the whistleblower's assertions? > [On 12 August 2019, an unnamed CIA officer filed a whistleblower complaint with Michael Atkinson, the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community (ICIG), under the provisions of the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act (ICWPA).

What legal precedents exist regarding a person subpoenaed by Congress but directed not to testify by the White House? Charles Kupperman, President Trump’s deputy national security adviser, did not appear Monday to his scheduled deposition and instead has asked a federal judge to decide what he must do:  "Plaintiff is faced with irreconcilable commands by the Legislative and Executive Branches of the Government and, accordingly, seeks a declaratory judgment from this Court as to whether he is lawfully obliged to comply with a subpoena issued by the House Defendants demanding his testimony '[p]ursuant to the House of Representatives' impeachment inquiry,' or he is lawfully obliged to abide by the assertion of immunity from congressional process made by the President in connection with the testimony sought from Plaintiff," the lawsuit [states](https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/28/politics/judge-impeachment-court-case/index.html)  The Trump Administration claims “the nature of his job as adviser means he is exempt from the congressional order,” [while](https://www.npr.org/2019/10/28/773524571/bolton-deputy-wants-court-ruling-before-he-talks-in-trump-impeachment-inquiry) Adam Schiff says this noncompliance has no basis in law.  [U.S. Code § 104 states](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/43/104) “Any person...neglecting or refusing to appear and testify when subpoenaed...shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, for which he shall be punished by indictment.”  [Executive Privilege](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/executive_privilege) “allows the president and other high officials of the executive branch to keep certain communications private if disclosing those communications would disrupt the functions or decision-making processes of the executive branch.”  The Supreme Court [found](https://www.acslaw.org/expertforum/executive-privilege-and-impeachment/) that executive privilege “could not block disclosure of information essential to the impeachment inquiry” with regards to *United States vs. Nixon.*  What applies? Is it on a case by case basis?
What are the pros and cons of nationalising the U.S. Defense Industry? Recently, I've read this [post by John Stanton](https://www.counterpunch.org/2006/07/06/nationalize-the-defense-industry/) where he's arguing that the U.S. Defense Industry should be nationalised. In which, he discusses what he sees as issues with how the military and defence works, and how nationalising would help solve these problems.   Some context:  Dwight D. Eisenhower warned Americans of a [Military Industrial Complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military%E2%80%93industrial_complex) - which is "an alliance between military officers and corporations that supply the military that does not serve the public interest."  Some groups have pushed in favour of further use of private military contractors. Well known Conservative thinktanks have called for [higher levels of privatization on military maintanence](https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/privatizing-military-maintenance), while others, including Jared Kushner, have also called for [hirings of so-called "private armies", such as Blackwater](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-michaels-privatization-military-20170720-story.html) for deployment abroad.     U.S. military spending has continued to [increase](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2019/04/18/us-military-spending-set-increase-fifth-consecutive-year-nearing-levels-during-height-iraq-war/), meanwhile the top 100 companies around the world with military contracts, such as [Boeing and Raytheon,](https://www.businessinsider.com/the-top-9-biggest-defense-contractors-in-america-2016-5?r=US&IR=T#3-raytheon-company-3)  saw [$389 billion in total arms sales in 2018](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/02/21/military-spending-defense-contractors-profiting-from-war-weapons-sales/39092315/). President Trump has been [warm to large military budgets](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/03/10/pentagon-eyes-windfall-as-trump-seeks-750-billion-defense-budget-military/), and has even nominated former Boeing board member, Patrick Shanahan, to [lead the Pentagon](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/05/10/trump-nominates-embodiment-military-industrial-complex-patrick-shanahan-lead).    However, critics of the current U.S. military system, like U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, have openly [attacked the current system](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/08/02/we-cannot-keep-handing-over-billions-military-industrial-complex-says-sanders-senate), saying that current spending and management is causing a so-called [death spiral in the defense industry](http://nation.time.com/2011/07/19/the-defense-death-spiral/). Senator Warren has proposed plans to [ban military contractors from hiring former Pentagon officials](https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2019/05/16/elizabeth-warren-announces-plan-to-unravel-military-industrial-complex/), and [proposes a bill that would curb Defense Lobbying](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/elizabeth-warren-introduces-bill-to-curb-defense-lobbying/), which has had reports of ["wasteful contractor payments"](https://www.forbes.com/sites/charlestiefer/2018/10/05/republicans-and-contractor-lobbies-force-defense-into-wasteful-contractor-payments/)  Even Donald Trump himself, has [lambasted the military industrial complex at times](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/oct/9/donald-trump-laments-endless-wars-amid-syria-backl/)   What are the pros and cons of nationalising the U.S. Defense Industry?   Are there any examples of other countries implementing something similar? If so, what were the results and/or effects?  Is there any mainstream support for this idea?
What discrepancies, if any, exist between the testimonies of William Taylor and Gordon Sundland? William Taylor..

My question is, what discrepancies.. if any.. exist between William Taylor's account and characterization of the events and Gordon Sondland's?  Are there other possible witnesses or testimony that might clear up these differences?  Sondlond is being asked to come in and clarify his testimony...  [https://edition.cnn.com/politics/live-news/impeachment-inquiry-10-22-2019/h\_02af9be2d464cb3e446915d1452ac42c](https://edition.cnn.com/politics/live-news/impeachment-inquiry-10-22-2019/h_02af9be2d464cb3e446915d1452ac42c)  If there are discrepancies, do any of them impact the impeachment inquiry into President Trump in a material way?
Under recent Canadian administrations, First Nation Reserves have reported extensive problems of finances in areas of education, clean water, children's healthcare, general healthcare on Reserves, and other areas. What policies or ideas are being proposed to help? Under recent Canadian administrations, the First Nation Reserves have reportedly had issues [funding areas in education](https://ammsa.com/publications/windspeaker/canada%E2%80%99s-aboriginal-education-crisis-column), [clean water](https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/government-spending-only-70-of-whats-needed-to-end-boil-water-advisories-on-reserves-pbo), [children's healthcare](https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/health-canada-ruling-children-1.4368393), [general healthcare on Reserves](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/ottawa-still-failing-to-provide-adequate-health-care-on-reserves-report/article33746065/), and other areas.

Dozens of House Republicans occupy the SCIF to stall the closed-door testimony of Laura Cooper. What are the laws regarding closed-door sessions and the usage of the SCIF, and can any sort of legal action be levied against these Republican lawmakers for such an action? This morning, Laura Cooper was scheduled to testify in the ongoing impeachment inquiry regarding President Trump and aid to Ukraine. As Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, she called in to speak about the mechanisms behind Ukranian aid and also the fallout from the White House's suspension of said aid over the summer. However, shortly before her testimony could begin, members of the House Freedom Caucus, led by Republican Matt Gaetz of the Flordia 1st, held a short press conference in the "basement of the Captial" in which they laid out complaints about the secrecy of the testimony and of the impeachment inquiry itself. [\[Fox News\]](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-lawmakers-in-blasting-secret-impeachment-probe-before-attempting-to-storm-the-proceedings)  After this short conference, Gaetz and what was reported to be around 30 House Republicans entered the House Intelligence Committee's Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, or SCIF, while outside members of the press heard the chanting of "Let us in." It has also been reported that Schiff has made contact with both the Sergeant of Arms and Capitol Police who are attempting to end the standoff.  [\[Politico\]](https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/23/impeachment-republicans-trump-055688) [\[Washington Post Outline\]](https://outline.com/4faWbE)  \-------------------  My question revolves around the nature of these closed-door hearings and the SCIF itself. What are the actual rules surrounding how it can be used and who can enter the room? What are the house rules on closed-door hearings and who can enter those? Many Republicans seem to be basing criticism on the rules and how unfair they are to the American voter whose representative can't get information about these hearings and testimonials, so how were these rules decided on if there is such a huge issue around representatives not having access to information? Finally, were any actual laws broken or is this an issue of ceremony where we might see censure, but no actual charges?

Canada Election Night Megathread *Omnes una manet nox - The same night awaits us all.*  **Liberal minority projected**  Happy election day!  Today is election day in Canada, with voters going to the polls to elect 338 members of Parliament across the country.  Each member is elected in a first past the post election from a single district called a "riding."^1  **[CBC Live Results Page](https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/elections/federal/2019/results/)**  **Live Streams**  * [CBC Live stream](https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/live-blog/federal-election-live-2019)  * [CTV Live stream](https://www.ctvnews.ca/video?playlistId=1.4647513)  * [TVA Live stream](https://www.tvanouvelles.ca/resultatselections2019) (in French)  (I am looking for a French live stream if anyone can point me to one; can't seem to find one on the Radio-Canada site)  Incumbent Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (Liberal) faces Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, as well as NDP leader Jagmeet Singh, Green leader Elizabeth May, Bloc Québécois leader Yves-François Blanchet, and the new People's Party leader Maxime Bernier.  Polls have now closed across Canada.  For those not up on Canadian geography and wondering "Does Canada really span 6 time zones?" Yes, [Canada is really big.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhiDILWFXBE)   [Polls have forecast that it is most likely no party will win a majority of the seats in Parliament.](https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/elections/poll-tracker/canada/)    In that event, there may be significant political jockeying over who can successfully hold the Prime Minister's office.  If you want a very detailed view of the law around forming government,^2 [this article from Professor Philippe Lagassé is an excellent overview.](https://journals.library.ualberta.ca/constitutional_forum/index.php/constitutional_forum/article/view/29384/21386)  As the night goes on, I may refer back to that piece in discussing government formation and minority or coalition government scenarios.  Once polls start closing I will begin a tick tock with results and other relevant news.  **4:32 PM EDT** Re: some questions in the comments, I am gonna talk a little bit about how things work in a minority government situation.  * As incumbent Prime Minister, Trudeau remains in office until and unless he resigns or is dismissed by the Governor General (GG) (Lagassé p. 6).  * There is a custom, not rule, that the party with the most seats will usually serve as the government.  If Trudeau's Liberals do not have the most seats, and he follows this custom, he would resign to allow the party with the most seats to form government. (Lagassé p. 11)  * If Trudeau does not resign as PM, when Parliament reconvenes, he will face a vote to test [whether he has the confidence of the Commons](https://www.ourcommons.ca/About/ProcedureAndPractice3rdEdition/ch_02_2-e.html) (the vote on the address in reply to the speech from the throne).  * If Trudeau passes that vote, he stays as PM.  * If Trudeau fails that vote, he could either resign, or advise the Governor General to call a snap election.  * If Trudeau resigned after losing confidence, the GG would choose the person the GG thought most likely to hold the confidence of the Commons, by practice the leader of the opposition is that person. (Lagassé p. 8)  * If Trudeau advised a snap election after losing confidence, the GG would decide whether she thought there was another viable government.     * If she thinks another viable government exists, she would refuse Trudeau's advice, and appoint an alternate government.  Trudeau would be forced to resign, or be formally dismissed if he did not resign. (Lagassé p. 6)   * If she thinks another viable government does not exist, she would agree to the advice, dissolve Parliament, and call a snap election.  Trudeau would remain PM through such a snap election. (Lagassé p. 8)  **6:35 PM EDT** Added some live stream links up top.  **7:00 PM EDT** Polls are now closed in Newfoundland and Labrador.  **7:20 PM EDT**  Liberals leading in 3 ridings that have results so far - all ridings they are expected to win.  **7:30 PM EDT** Polls closed in the maritime provinces now.  Will have a 2 hour wait from now until we get the big poll closing for QC/ON/MB/SK/AB/Territories.  **7:44 PM EDT Lib:2** Two seats called in Newfoundland for the Liberals, in seats they were pretty comfortably expected to hold.  Conservatives not leading in many seats but seem to be improving on 2015 in raw vote counts so far.  **8:00 PM EDT Lib: 5**  Lot of seats in NS and NB where conservatives are looking good, but very few votes in so far.  NDP looks likely to get a flip in Saint John's East.  **8:23 PM EDT Lib: 8; NDP: 1** First flip of the night.  NDP has taken Saint John's East from the Liberals.  Conservatives are leading in 6 seats (all previously Liberal) but have not gotten any of them called for them.  About an hour still until we get the giant polls close from all of Canada except BC, so will be lots more parsing Atlantic Canada for a while yet.  **8:41 PM EDT Lib 12; Con 2; NDP 1**  Conservatives have their first flips of the night, both in New Brunswick along the Maine border.  Leading in a few more in NB, lots of very close races there, as well as a few close ones in NS.  **8:45 PM EDT Lib 14; Con 2; NDP 1** Greens are now leading in Fredericton but not elected there yet.  Conservatives in 2nd there right now.   **9:06 PM EDT Lib 18; Con 3; NDP 1** Added a French stream from TVA above.  Also interesting we have some votes from Gaspe area because of the time zone.  Liberal incumbent leading the Bloc candidate by a little bit, but not much in yet.  **9:26 PM EDT Lib 19; Con 3; NDP 1**  Ok just before the huge polls close, looks like the Liberals are decently positioned to hold a plurality.  Will be interesting how much the Bloc can take both from the other 3 parties with QC seats in the overall balance of power.  They are now leading in the Gaspe seat.  This will be a long night.  **9:30 PM EDT Lib 20; Con 3; NDP 1**  Okay, here we go!  Big poll close time.  **9:40 PM EDT Lib 20; Con 4; NDP 1** I'm only saying called seats, but Liberals are leading in a lot of spots.  Bloc not getting too many leads.  Bernier of the People's Party looks to be getting his seat.   **9:44 PM EDT Lib 21; Con 4; NDP 1**  One GTA suburbs seat with meaningful vote in, going well for the Liberals.  If they perform like this in the rest of the Toronto area, Justin Trudeau will have a very good night.  **9:47 PM EDT Lib 21; Con 4; NDP 1** And now they're behind in that seat... so things are swinging a lot.  Bernier is also now behind in his seat.  **9:53 PM EDT Lib 21; Con 4; NDP 1** Looks like the Bloc and Liberals are cutting up Quebec between them, which is pretty good for the Liberals, and a (mostly expected) disaster for the NDP.  **9:58 PM EDT Lib 22; Con 4; NDP 1**  Liberals are leading in 94 seats and are only seeing a net swing of -6 so far, which is really strong for them, since they could lose about 16 and still have a majority.  **10:00 PM EDT Lib 22; Con 4; NDP 1**  Polls are now closed across Canada.  **10:05 PM EDT Lib 22; Con 4; NDP 1** Looks like the Liberals are leading in a lot of GTA seats, seems like all of the seats in Mississauga and Brampton so far are red, as well as the center Toronto seats.  Couple of seats up by Vaughan with a Conservative lead.  **10:10 PM EDT**  **CBC is projecting a Liberal government** (though probably more fair to say Liberal plurality).  **10:15 PM EDT Lib 23; Con 8; NDP 1**  Based on leads, Liberals are losing about net 20 seats, and probably on track to lose some more which would put them into minority government territory.  **10:23 PM EDT  Lib 26; Con 19; BQ 2; NDP 1**  Liberal minority government projected, big question will be whether Liberal+NDP will make it to 170.  Right now they are just at that line with leading + elected.  150 Liberal leading+elected, 20 NDP leading+ elected.  **10:39 PM EDT Lib 52; Con 58; BQ 10; NDP 1** Despite Conservative lead in locked-up seats, Liberals still leading in plenty more.  Looks like all the party leaders on track to hold their seats.  **10:50 PM EDT Lib 77; Con 73; BQ 18; NDP 2** I was mistaken about all the leaders keeping their seats.  Bernier is defeated, and the PPC is getting very little traction.  Trudeau and Scheer have won their seats.  May is leading in her seat, as is Singh (though Singh is only up by a few percent).  **11:02 PM EDT Lib 100; Con 85; BQ 22; NDP 6; Grn 1** Interestingly, the Liberals are likely to be in government despite getting less popular vote than the Conservatives, though extremely close right now.  33.8% Liberal, 33.9% Conservative.  Definitely the Liberals are seeing big vote efficiency advantages, with Alberta especially having some huge blowout ridings where the Conservatives do not get much of any advantage by winning by 50+%.  **11:15 PM EDT Lib 110; Con 95; BQ 25; NDP 9; Grn 1**  Looks like based on leading+elected that the Liberals would only need the support of one of the NDP or Bloc to have a working majority, so that gives them several paths to keeping confidence of the Commons (seems by far most likely they'd do that through the NDP).  **11:24 PM EDT Lib 114; Con 97; BQ 26; NDP 9; Grn 2** Greens look to be getting about 4 seats tonight, which would be by far their best haul ever.    We also are looking at a pretty definite popular vote / seat count split, with the Liberals now 0.6% behind the Conservatives in raw vote, but far ahead in seat count.  **11:28 PM EDT Lib 115; Con 100; BQ 26; NDP 9; Grn 2**  Liberals are going to be locked out of having any seats in Alberta and probably Saskatchewan, which could be a problem for regional divisions.  **11:40 PM EDT  Lib 120; Con 106; BQ 26; NDP 11; Grn 2**  Going to end the tick tock here.  Results of the night seem pretty clear.  Biggest remaining question seems to be whether Scheer remains conservative leader.  ---  ^1 I do not know why Canadian electoral districts are called "ridings" in English.  Anyone have a good source on that?  ^2 For readers not used to Westminster-style systems, "government" is used in the way "administration" would be used in the American context.  So the "Trudeau government" is the current administration in charge of Canada, consisting of PM Trudeau, his cabinet, and other senior political officials.  The term is not used here to mean the whole apparatus of the state, as it often would be in the US.
Universal basic services vs means-tested welfare programs: Which method has been historically proven to be more effective at helping the needy/reducing poverty? [Universal basic services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_basic_services) “are a form of social security in which all citizens or residents of a community, region, or country receive unconditional access to a range of free, basic, public services, funded by taxes and provided by a government or public institution.”  [Means-tested welfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Means-tested_benefit) “is a payment available to people who can demonstrate that their income and capital (their 'means') are below specified limits.”  Which one has shown to be more effective at reducing poverty and helping those in need?   Which one has shown to be more cost-effective?

What are the pros and cons of a Wealth Tax when compared with a VAT Tax? After watching the democratic debates last night I wanted clarification on the merits of the VAT Tax and the Wealth Tax. [7 remaining candidates](https://www.politico.com/2020-election/candidates-views-on-the-issues/tax-reform/wealth-taxes/) support a wealth tax compared to [1 candidate](https://www.politico.com/2020-election/candidates-views-on-the-issues/tax-reform/business-taxes/) who supports a VAT. So far, no candidates support doing both.   &#x200B;  [Wealth Tax definition](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wealth-tax.asp):  >Wealth tax is a tax based on the market value of assets that are owned.  &#x200B;  [VAT definition](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042315/what-are-some-examples-value-added-tax.asp):  >A value-added tax (VAT) is a consumption tax levied on products at every point of sale where value has been added, starting from raw materials and going all the way to the final retail purchase. Ultimately, the consumer pays the VAT; buyers at earlier stages of production receive reimbursements for the previous VAT they've paid.
Can an impeachment panel in the US House of Representatives subpoena a member of the Senate? US Senator Lindsey Graham [was tricked by pranksters](https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/10/lindsey-graham-trump-hoax-call-043991) into a hoax conversation in which he mentioned President Trump's personal interest in a "Turkish bank case". This was the investigation of [Reza Zarrab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reza_Zarrab#2013_corruption_scandal_in_Turkey), whom [the President pressed his subordinates to let go and whom the President's lawyer Rudy Giuliani was attempting to send home to Turkey](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-09/trump-urged-top-aide-to-help-giuliani-client-facing-doj-charges). Although the President's pressure was unsuccessful (today the Department of Justice also [filed criminal charges against the bank](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/turkish-bank-charged-manhattan-federal-court-its-participation-multibillion-dollar)), it may be a possible abuse of office that falls under the purview of the [presidential impeachment inquiry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_inquiry_against_Donald_Trump) in the House of Representatives.  Since Senator Graham accidentally indicated he has some inside knowledge of the President's involvement in this affair, he may be a witness to possible misconduct. Does the House have the authority to issue a subpoena demanding his testimony, or does his status as a member of the other chamber of Congress protect him?
Impeachment & Removal - Campaign Procedure/Precedent & Party Responsibilities As [no President has been impeached and removed in US History](https://time.com/5552679/impeached-presidents/), I have a few questions about the process and how it would affect the GOP should it come to that:  * First, what is the precedent for past elevated VP's when it comes to running for reelection? Have they typically chosen new running mates and run as the primary candidate on the ticket, has the party nominated a new presidential candidate and they remain the VP on that ballot, or have they typically decided not to run? * Second, what is the party's obligation in the case of removal from office, as it relates to an upcoming election? Do they have to stage primaries and debates? Or do they operate under the assumption that since the VP was chosen as the running mate, that he would be the de facto nominee? Would additional outside candidates have the chance to throw their hats in the ring?
What exactly is the Queen's Speech in the UK? How does the vote on the speech work? What happens if the speech is voted down? Today, Queen Elizabeth II delivered [a Queen's Speech opening a new session of Parliament.](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-50016682)  The speech describes the government's agenda of legislation.  According to that article, after 6 days of debate, MPs will vote on the speech.  The article also notes that the Johnson government faces a significant risk of losing that vote, and that the last PM to lose such a vote was Stanley Baldwin in 1924.  My questions are:  * What, exactly, is voted on at the end of 6 days?  I am aware of Canadian practice that there is a vote on [the address in reply to the speech from the throne.](https://www.ourcommons.ca/About/ProcedureAndPractice3rdEdition/ch_15_1-e.html)  Is that the same practice as in the UK?  * Does a defeat on the vote on the Queen's speech constitute a vote of no confidence in the government?  * If not, is that a change brought by the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, 2011?  [This briefing paper suggests the FTPA may have altered the confidence conventions.](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmpubadm/1813/1813.pdf)
How realistic is Erogdans strategy in Syria and does it have sympathy or support from any other countries? Most of the media talks about the issue of incursion into Syria from the lens of US foreign policy. I'm trying to understand the motivations behind Turkeys strategy and what they hope to achieve.   With /u/nosecohn 's help I found this article.  https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/turkey/2019-10-09/turkeys-endgame-syria  >>His solution, recently laid out in a speech at the UN General Assembly, is to carve out a large buffer zone along Syria’s border with Turkey. The area would be 300 miles long and 20 miles deep, under Turkish control, and off-limits to Kurdish forces. According to Erdogan, this “safe zone” would host two million to three million refugees, thus ridding Ankara of a major domestic headache. It would boast 200,000 homes, along with hospitals, football pitches, mosques, and schools, Turkish-built but financed internationally—a setup that would provide much-needed revenue for Turkey’s struggling construction sector at a time of economic downturn.  It sounds like there are three outcomes trying to be achieved. 1/ Relocation of refugees who are becoming a difficult problem for domestic politics 2/ Undermine the possibility of creation of a Kurdish state 3/ Provide economic stimulus to the domestic construction industry through construction projects funded by the international community (nobody has agreed to that but I guess they will try to bargain for it)  How realistic is this plan and does it have sympathy or support from any other countries?
To what extent is oikophobia an issue in western countries? There have been a couple of essays published recently discussing oikophobia, which is the fear and hatred of one’s own. It is the opposite extreme of xenophobia. See [this essay for example.](https://quillette.com/2019/10/07/oikophobia-our-western-self-hatred/)  There has been [bipartisan criticism](https://www.google.com/amp/s/sports.yahoo.com/amphtml/ted-cruz-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-cosign-congressional-request-that-nba-suspend-activities-in-china-021745024.html) of companies like the NBA, who claim to support progressive social issues, yet are unwilling to speak up about human rights abuses by the Chinese government.   Anecdotally, I’ve noticed oikophobic sentiments among various political and cultural institutions in America. The New York Times [claims](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/14/magazine/1619-america-slavery.html) the first Atlantic slave ship from 1619 marks the true founding of the United States. Nike [pulls back from releasing](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2019/07/02/business/betsy-ross-shoe-kaepernick-nike.amp.html) a shoe with Revolutionary War symbology because of America’s history with slavery. White progressives [have been shown to possess a bias in favor of outgroups in a recent study.](https://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/284875/americas-white-saviors)  Is oikophobia rising in the West?
How would the US transition to Medicare for All work for private insurance companies? [S.1129 - Medicare for All Act of 2019](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/1129/text) will transition the US from having a combination of private and public health insurance agencies to having a single government agency.   Those who qualify for the universal Medicare plan would get four years to transition into it.   “During the transition to universal health care, in the first year this legislation will immediately improve traditional Medicare for seniors and people with disabilities by covering dental, vision and hearing aids which are not covered under current law. The Medicare eligibility age will be reduced to 55 and Medicare Part A, Part B and Part D deductibles would be eliminated. Moreover, during the first year, every child between the ages of 0-18 would become eligible to enroll in the Universal Medicare program.  A Medicare Transition plan would also be established during year one to provide affordable coverage for all Americans and to make sure that no one loses coverage.  During the second year of implementation, the Medicare eligibility age would be reduced to 45. During the third year, the eligibility age would be lowered to 35.  By the fourth year, every individual who is a resident of the United States will be entitled to benefits for comprehensive health care services and will get a Universal Medicare card that they can use to receive the health care they need.” — [Source](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/medicare-for-all-act-of-2017-executive-summary?id=943E7DB5-FCCA-4EA4-B215-A92F6642BA2C&amp;download=1&amp;inline=file)  I am aware the 2017 bill is not the same as the 2019 bill. But it’s close enough.   There are approximately [900,000 people](https://www.statista.com/statistics/215205/number-of-us-life-health-and-medical-insurance-employees/) who work in the life, health and medical insurance industry in the United States. Although that’s including industries not affected by M4A, most of those people are gonna be out of a job over the course of 4 years. And given that a lot of what they did was redundant because there were several different corporations, then most of them likely won’t be able to find a job working for Medicare.   Historically, how did insurance companies change their practices based on similar laws worldwide? Are there studies that show the projected impact of Medicare for All on insurance companies?
Are people other than US President Donald Trump implicated in possibly illegal activity related to the House's impeachment inquiry? The US House of Representatives has begun an impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump regarding the [recent Ukraine scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump%E2%80%93Ukraine_controversy). That process of impeachment and removal from office is possibly the only recourse against a sitting president's abuse of office, given [standing Department of Justice policy](https://www.justice.gov/olc/opinion/sitting-president%E2%80%99s-amenability-indictment-and-criminal-prosecution) that it cannot pursue criminal charges against the president.  So this question is about everyone else. Has anyone close to the president reportedly engaged in behavior, related to the matters in the impeachment inquiry, that can be construed as illegal? If so, is it a possible violation of federal law (which the president [can pardon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_pardons_in_the_United_States)) or of state law (which he [cannot](https://www.justice.gov/pardon/frequently-asked-questions))?
What are the pros and cons of the US withdrawing from the Open Skies treaty? What is the Open Skies Treaty? The treaty allows 34 countries to conduct unarmed surveillance flights over one another's territories -- including the US and Russia. It was signed in 1992 and went into effect in 2002.   Why is it in the news now? Officials are reporting that Trump is intending to withdraw from the 34 nation treaty.   Why is it a big deal? Trump's critics claim that the treaty allows us to monitor Russian military movements, and a withdrawal from the treaty would only benefit Russia.   The White House has so far not confirmed the expected withdrawal or reasons for it. However, a State Department spokesman's comment did hint at dissatisfaction with the treaty. "We continue to implement the treaty and are in full compliance with our obligations under this Treaty, unlike Russia," the spokesperson said.   What are the objective benefits of withdrawal vs the negative implications of withdrawal?

Why is the US allowing Turkey to invade the Kurdish-controlled areas of Northern Syria? On Sunday, President Trump suddenly and unexpectedly announced that US troops in Northern Syria would allow Turkey to invade the area, currently held by the Syrian Kurds and other US allies.   In the many articles I have seen about this announcement, I cannot find a reason why this decision was made. Is there an official reason why the US would reverse years of policy and turn against an ally that was instrumental in fighting ISIS?  News articles about US forces pulling out of Northern Syria: [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/07/politics/white-house-turkey-syria-intl-hnk/index.html)   [Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/turkey-announces-incursion-of-northeast-syria-us-backed-kurds-have-vowed-all-out-war)    [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-49956698)  [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-administration-to-pull-troops-from-northern-syria-as-turkey-readies-offensive/2019/10/07/a965e466-e8b3-11e9-bafb-da248f8d5734_story.html)
The Trump Administration’s State Department has directed EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland to not appear for a voluntary scheduled interview before the House Joint Committee with regard to his role in the Trump/Ukraine story. Is the White House/State Dept empowered to prevent Sondland’s testimony? One source, of many; https://www.npr.org/2019/10/08/768200323/trump-administration-blocks-ambassadors-testimony-a-key-witness-in-ukraine-scand?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf  Here’s the statement from Sondland’s legal council, from that article:   > **"Early this morning, the U.S. Department of State directed Ambassador Gordon Sondland not to appear today for his scheduled transcribed interview before the U.S. House of Representatives Joint Committee,"** the law firm representing Sondland said in a statement. **"Ambassador Sondland had previously agreed to appear voluntarily today, without the need for a subpoena, in order to answer the Committee's questions on an expedited basis. As the sitting U.S. Ambassador to the EU and employee of the State Department, Ambassador Sondland is required to follow the Department's direction."**  Is this a valid explanation? Must an Ambassador to the United States comply with any order or direction the State Department gives them? Is there anywhere the State Dept’s powers are enumerated in this regard?   Would ordering a subpoena have made the process significantly less “expedited”? What benefit is there to not subpoenaing someone in a high-profile case like this?   Also;  > House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said Tuesday morning that he considers the blocking of Sondland's testimony and release of documents that Democrats are seeking to be "additional strong evidence of obstruction of the constitutional functions of Congress."  > He added, "We will consider this act today ... to be further acts of obstruction of a co-equal branch of government."  Is this obstruction of justice? Some other crime? If so, on whose part, specifically?  Another source; https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/gordon-sondland-key-us-official-in-political-storm-over-ukraine-to-be-deposed-in-impeachment-inquiry/2019/10/07/c3c1703e-e942-11e9-9306-47cb0324fd44_story.html  > The State Department **left a voice-mail message with Sondland’s attorneys at 12:30 a.m. Tuesday, informing them that he would not be allowed to testify**, the Democratic committee chairmen leading the impeachment inquiry said in a joint statement.  If Sondland’s attorneys had simply *not checked their voicemail*, would Sondland have been allowed to testify? How does this work, legally speaking? Does a voicemail constitute a direction? And who is empowered to make such a direction in the first place in the State Department?
Would designating Iran's Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist organization allow the Executive Branch to unilaterally use force against the nation of Iran without further Congressional approval? [Earlier in the year](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-president-designation-islamic-revolutionary-guard-corps-foreign-terrorist-organization/), the Trump administration attempted to label Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps a terrorist organization.  Given that the [18 Sept 2001 AUMF](https://www.congress.gov/107/plaws/publ40/PLAW-107publ40.pdf) is still valid, could this designation allow for the executive branch to legally use force against an entire nation using previous authorization against terrorist organizations?
America does not seem to have an interest in "day fines," fining people a percent of their income. Why is that so? [Wikipedia discusses day fines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day-fine), commonly used in traffic violations. Day fines are somewhat common in Europe.  Excerpt:  >Jurisdictions employing the day-fine include Finland, Estonia, Sweden , Denmark, Germany, France, Switzerland, and Macao.  In some countries the fines can be rather high.

The Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act is a bill in the US House of Representatives that proposes a carbon fee and dividend. Have other countries/cities/states implemented a similar carbon fee and dividend?    The [Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act of 2019](https://energyinnovationact.org/)(HR 763) is a bill that is supported by the [Citizens' Climate Lobby](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/energy-innovation-and-carbon-dividend-act/). This bill is a proposed [carbon fee and dividend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_fee_and_dividend) where ["The money collected from the carbon fee is allocated in equal shares every month to the American people to spend as they see fit."](https://energyinnovationact.org/how-it-works/?cn-reloaded=1)  In places where similar carbon fees have been implemented, do they act as a "regressive tax," or does the dividend adequately offset any increases to cost of living? Are there any issues with the bill, economically, that result in a financial burden on people with low income?
What forces are responsible for the continued protests seen in Iraq? Iraq has had continuous anti-government protests since the Arab Spring ([2011](https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/01/22/iraq-intensifying-crackdown-free-speech-protests), [2012](https://web.archive.org/web/20110826043422/http://www.ctc.usma.edu/posts/the-jrtn-movement-and-iraq%E2%80%99s-next-insurgency), [2015](http://studies.aljazeera.net/en/reports/2015/08/20158307585163273.html) to name a few). Most recently, this week's protest has led to [more than 100 people killed and thousands injured.](https://www.npr.org/2019/10/06/767711133/more-than-100-killed-and-thousands-injured-in-anti-government-protests-in-iraq) with some sources reporting that [live ammunition is being used on protestors](https://www.businessinsider.com/video-appears-to-show-rocket-flies-past-iraq-youtuber-protests-2019-10).    Iraqis have long stated protests occur due to [corruption within their government, unemployment, and a lack of access to utilities (electricity, water)](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-49960677) while state governments have been quick to put the blame on other parties, such as Iran's government blaming [western influencers](https://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Iraq-protests-are-real-war-with-US-Khamenei-IRGC-representative-603990) and Iraq's government blaming ['malicious hands'](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/06/iraq-government-pledges-to-investigate-live-firing-on-protesters) outside of their military.  Is there any merit to the idea that forces outside of Iraq's own government have created unrest among Iraqi citizens, or is there a deeper root cause of public unrest?
What's "illegal" about Airbus subsidies? Quoting from [this article](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-49906815):  > It is the latest chapter in a 15-year battle between the US and the EU over illegal subsidies for planemakers Airbus and rival Boeing.  Who's doing the subsidizing and what's (ostensibly) illegal about it?
How and why does a government whistleblower remain anonymous? The recent whistleblower in the Trump-Ukraine scandal is currently remaining anonymous despite [Trump's efforts to identify him](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/09/30/whistleblower-complaint-trump-criticized-trying-id-ukraine-whistleblower/3823257002/).   My question is what are the protections given to the whistleblower, why/when were they put into place and does Trump have any right to face his accuser?
Where does the difference lie between Quid Pro Quo and compromise? The entire [Trump-Ukraine scandal](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/watch/here-s-a-breakdown-of-the-key-players-in-the-trump-ukraine-scandal-70705221593) is based around Trump reportedly asking the Ukrainian government to investigate the Biden’s in exchange for foreign aid and a visit to the White House. Is the issue here that Trump would be receiving material election assistance from a foreign agent, in violation of [FEC law](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/03/fec-chair-subtweets-trump-after-plea-for-china-to-investigate-bidens.html)?  The NRA has recently been accused of trying to [bribe](https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/democrats-want-fbi-to-investigate-whether-the-nra-bribed-trump/) Trump because they reportedly declined offer support against impeachment unless Trump softened his stance on gun restrictions. Is lobbying inherently Quid Pro Quo?  How can we expect politicians compromise on legislation if they might be accused of Quid Pro Quo? For example, if a senator agrees to back a farm subsidy bill that doesn’t directly benefit his state in exchange for another senator backing more funding for infrastructure which does directly benefit his state, is that Quid Pro Quo?  If not, wherein does the different lie for these three examples?  Edited for clarity.
What can the President and other elected officials ask foreign countries to"look into" regarding US citizens? Per the White House [rough transcript](https://apnews.com/afs:Content:7671040001), President Trump told President Zelensky  *"there's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that...I will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to have Attorney General Barr call and we will get to the bottom of it. I'm sure you will figure it out."*  Critics like [Adam Schiff](https://twitter.com/repadamschiff/status/1176679886620110848?s=21) claim  *"Trump abused the power of his office by pressuring Ukraine to manufacture dirt on a political rival. It’s a gross abuse of his office. And a danger to national security."*  Supporters like [Rudy Giuliani](https://apnews.com/1fe55157bfcb4f1c96cf128c2c5f2d99) assert  *“the president was not tasking Ukraine to investigate a political opponent.  He wanted an investigation into a seriously conflicted former vice president of the United States who damaged the reputation of the United States in Ukraine.”*  [Trump](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1179925259417468928?s=21)  himself tweeted  *"As the President of the United States, I have an absolute right, perhaps even a duty, to investigate, or have investigated, CORRUPTION, and that would include asking, or suggesting, other Countries to help us out!"*   He later [added](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1179935210445647882?s=21)  *"This isn't about a Campaign, this is about Corruption on a massive scale!"*  Has a sitting president been accused of asking another country for damaging information on a rival before? If so, what was the outcome politically and legally?  More broadly, what investigative requests of US citizens by foreign governments are allowed? Is there a distinction between private citizens, elected officials, and appointed officials making the request?
How should r/NeutralPolitics deal with the flood of submissions about the unfolding Ukraine story and impeachment? As readers will no doubt be aware, there is a major political event engulfing American politics related to President Trump and his conduct in respect to Ukraine.    With the House of Representatives moving in the direction of impeachment, the subreddit has been inundated with submissions on the details of the scandal, as well as the legal and political processes around it.  The mods are posting this thread to seek advice and feedback from users on how to handle this, as the volume of posts has become difficult, and we have unfortunately had some threads go off the rails.  A few options we have are:  1. **Using "green" questions to ask about major new developments.**  That is where the mods will write up a rules-compliant thread on a subject of major interest.  We have done this in the past with similar subjects.  [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/6a9j3d/is_there_evidence_to_suggest_the_firing_of_james/) for example.  2. **Just keep having normal question threads.**  3.  **Create megathreads when major new events happen.** A couple past examples of that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/6989bb/ahca_megathread/) and [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/9iv4mt/megathread_un_general_assembly/)  4. **Have the mods write and post explainer threads on major issues.**  We did that [once](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/d8vz0o/mod_post_an_overview_of_the_impeachment_process/) in respect to this instance after Speaker Pelosi made an announcement of an impeachment inquiry.    5.  **Something else.** I am just posting stuff here we've done in the past, but if people have ideas for different things to try, we'd love to hear them.

Nixon, contrary to his oath faithfully to execute the office of President of the United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in violation of his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, has failed without lawful cause or excuse to produce papers and things as directed by duly authorized subpoenas issued by the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives on April 11, 1974, May 15, 1974, May 30, 1974, and June 24, 1974, and willfully disobeyed such subpoenas. The subpoenaed papers and things were deemed necessary by the Committee in order to resolve by direct evidence fundamental, factual questions relating to Presidential direction, knowledge or approval of actions demonstrated by other evidence to be substantial grounds for impeachment of the President. In refusing to produce these papers and things Richard M. Nixon, substituting his judgment as to what materials were necessary for the inquiry, interposed the powers of the Presidency against the lawful subpoenas of the House of Representatives, thereby assuming to himself functions and judgments necessary to the exercise of the sole power of impeachment vested by the Constitution in the House of Representatives.
What does it mean to, "solicit, accept, or receive anything of value from a foreign national in connection with a U.S. election"? The Chairman of the Federal Election Commission has [posted a notice](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/Chair_Weintraub_on_Illegal_Foreign_Contributions.pdf) reminding us of [52 U.S.C. § 30121(a)(2), *Contributions and donations by foreign nationals*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/52/30121):  &nbsp;  > **Statement Regarding Illegal Contributions From Foreign Governments** > > &nbsp; > June 13, 2019 > &nbsp; > > &nbsp; Let me make something 100% clear to the American public and anyone running for public office:  It  is  illegal  for  any  person  to  solicit,  accept,  or  receive  anything  of  value  from  a  foreign  national  in  connection  with  a  U.S.  election.^1  This  is  not  a  novel  concept.

President Trump has claimed that Congress is engaged in a campaign of "Presidential Harassment." Is there merit to those claims? If so, what could he do about it? [Congressional democrats may be issuing subpoenas for White House records relating to the president's phone calls with a the Ukrainian president as part of their new impeachment inquiry.](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-democrats-threaten-white-house-subpoena-ukraine-documents-n1061141)  President Trump [has previously derided the inquiry as "Presidential harassment," a term he has used to describe Congressional inquires since last year.](https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/25/politics/trump-oversight-presidential-harassment/index.html) Are his claims about this correct?

I know [Obama used executive privilege to block the disclosure of some internal communications in that gun running thing,](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/28/eric-holder-contempt-historic-congress-vote) but will there be a different categorization for calls with foreign governments?    And if so, are ALL calls transcribed like this, and archived?
Is it legal (under U.S. law) for Hunter Biden to have served on the board of Burisma Holdings (a politically sensitive natural gas producer in Ukraine) while Joe Biden was vice-president of the U.S.? Burisma Holdings is a Ukrainian natural gas producer. It holds 35 government concessions to produce hydrocarbons (per Reuters, see https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-whistleblower-burisma-factb/factbox-burisma-the-obscure-ukrainian-gas-company-at-the-heart-of-us-political-row-idUSKBN1W91UG)  It has been alleged that the owner of Burisma— Mykola Zlochevsky, the former ecology minister of Ukraine— was able to secure the concessions from the Ukrainian government via some corrupt means. (I heard on NPR this morning and found this NYT article with some broad strokes on this saga but does not address the concessions directly: https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/09/world/europe/corruption-ukraine-joe-biden-son-hunter-biden-ties.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share)  Hunter Biden was appointed to the board of Burisma in April 2014 and was allegedly paid up to $50k per month for his services. Hunter had tested positive for cocaine and was discharged from a ceremonial post with the U.S. Navy in February 2014. He remained on the Burisma board until April of this year. (https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/01/us/politics/biden-son-ukraine.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share)  He is a Yale educated lawyer who did some lobbying work while his father was in the Senate. What specific expertise did he bring to bear on the governance of a natural gas company in Ukraine?  I have seen some reporting that Ukrainian officials looked into this and said Hunter broke no Ukrainian laws. There is no legal limit in Ukraine on board compensation. (https://nypost.com/2019/05/16/joe-biden-and-son-hunter-cleared-of-wrongdoing-by-ukraine-prosecutor/) But how is that relevant? Why is that the standard?  I don’t know if Biden’s conduct runs afoul of any U.S. laws. Is it legal?
What is an impeachment inquiry? US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has [announced,](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-whislteblower/house-begins-trump-impeachment-inquiry-over-call-to-ukraine-leader-idUSKBN1W91OP) "the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry" with respect to President Trump's dealings with Ukraine.  Although [the impeachment process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_in_the_United_States) is defined in the Constitution, an *official impeachment inquiry* is not, and even [some Democrats seem confused about its definition.](https://www.newsweek.com/mixed-messaging-house-democrats-impeachment-inquiry-1458803)  This leads me to a bunch of questions:  * What is the process for an official impeachment inquiry? * Are the procedures spelled out anywhere, or can each individual Congress decide what it involves? * If the latter, how does Congress decide which members make that decision? * Does the House have to vote on whether to start such an inquiry, or does the Speaker have that power by herself. Is even a committee vote required? * Does such an inquiry automatically lead to a vote on whether to file articles of impeachment? * How long should the inquiry take? Is there a time limit? * Does starting an "official" impeachment inquiry give the Congress more investigative or subpoena powers than it already has? If so, what are they?
[Mod post] An overview of the impeachment process in the United States **Mod note:  This post is intended to be just about the procedure and law around impeachment and not about the substance of any offenses.  We will treat comments which are not on the subject of the law and procedure of impeachment as off topic.  Feel free to post questions about the process or law in the comments below.**  This afternoon, [Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi announced](https://www.cbsnews.com/live-news/trump-impeachment-democrats-march-to-impeachment-speeds-up-over-trump-ukraine-call-live-updates-2019/) "the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry."    [*Transcript of her remarks*](https://www.speaker.gov/newsroom/92419-0)  Given this, we are writing a brief overview of how the impeachment of the President works.    Except where otherwise noted, I will be using [this Congressional Research Service report as my main source.](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44260.pdf)  #Constitutional Provisions  [The Constitution](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript) has three clauses describing the process of impeachment:  *Article II, Section 4*  >The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.  *Article I, Section 2*  >The House of Representatives ... shall have the sole Power of Impeachment.  *Article I, Section 3*  >The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present.  >Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.  #Process Overview  There are three essential steps:  1. The House votes (by a simple majority) to impeach the President.  2.  The Senate holds a trial, with the Chief Justice presiding.    3.  The Senate votes on guilt, with 2/3 of Senators needing to vote "guilty" to convict.  #Process in the House of Representatives  The House has fairly broad discretion in what steps they take prior to voting on an impeachment resolution.   [Pelosi indicated](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/us/politics/democrats-impeachment-trump.html?action=click&module=Spotlight&pgtype=Homepage) that the six standing committees of the House will forward impeachment related materials to the Judiciary Committee, which will consider articles of impeachment and, if approved, forward them to the House for consideration.  If the House decides to vote to impeach, they will need to draft specific articles of impeachment laying out the alleged acts for which the President is to be tried.  I am including as examples copies of the articles of impeachment against [Andrew Johnson](https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Impeachment_Johnson.htm#7), [Bill Clinton](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/articles122098.htm), and the articles adopted by the Judiciary Committee in respect to [Richard Nixon.](http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/history/johnson/rnimparticles.htm)  After voting to approve articles of impeachment, the House will appoint "managers" who will act as the prosecution for the trial in the Senate.  #Process in the Senate  The Senate process is much more formalized, and structured as a trial.  The Senate adopted the current rules for impeachment trials [in 1986.](https://www.law.cornell.edu/background/impeach/senaterules.pdf)  The Senate can either conduct the trial before the full Senate, or before a committee, which would report its transcript to the full Senate.  The full Senate must vote on guilt or acquittal.    If questions of evidence or procedure arose the presiding officer (the Chief Justice, for the trial of the President) would rule on them, but could be overridden by a vote of the Senate.  During the trial of Bill Clinton, [witnesses were deposed on videotape and the tape played to the Senate.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_of_Bill_Clinton#Senate_trial)   Witnesses were heard live in the Senate during [Andrew Johnson's trial.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_of_Andrew_Johnson#Trial)  After the trial the Senate would move into a closed session to deliberate, and then vote in open session.  Two thirds of senators voting must vote "guilty" on a count to convict.  #After a finding of guilty or not guilty  If the President were found guilty on any count of the impeachment, he would immediately be removed from office and the Vice President would immediately become President.  The Senate would then vote on whether to disqualify the ex-President from "any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States."  The disqualification vote would be by a simple majority.  If the conduct which was the subject of the impeachment were also an ordinary crime, the ex-President could separately be tried for that crime.  If found not guilty, the President would continue in office.
Members of Congress are looking at appropriations control to seek accountability for Trump's alleged conduct in asking the Ukrainian government to investigate Joe Biden's family. Is using Congressional appropriations as leverage to investigate a political rival a formal legal issue? Democrats in the House and Senate, as well as some Republicans, are [pushing for accountability](https://www.apnews.com/e5607bb2be55436f824515b35539a97e) on Trump's [alleged behavior](https://www.apnews.com/94fdeaddc6b34c02b97278674b87541e) with Ukraine.  The specific area of concern is that President Trump used [appropriated Congressional spending](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-ukraine/trump-administration-reinstates-military-aid-for-ukraine-idUSKCN1VX213) on foreign aid as leverage to get the newly elected leader of Ukraine to investigate Democratic nominee Joe Biden and his son (From Source 1):  > Democrats, and some Republicans, urged the White House to be forthcoming amid the reports that the president pressured Ukraine’s leader to help investigate political rival Joe Biden at the same time the administration was withholding $250 million in aid to the Eastern European nation.  [Furthermore](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/23/us/politics/trump-un-biden-ukraine.html):   > Mr. Trump has acknowledged that he mentioned the Bidens in a call on July 25 with the new Ukrainian leader, Volodymyr Zelensky, and people familiar with the call have said Mr. Trump repeatedly urged Mr. Zelensky to speak with one of his personal lawyers, Rudolph W. Giuliani. Mr. Giuliani has been pushing Ukraine aggressively to look into the Bidens and the origins of material that implicated Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman, in 2016.  ---  I have a few of questions on this topic:  1. Do Presidential powers allow a President to dictate terms on appropriated Congressional aid to a foreign country? For example, suppose President Trump said Ukraine would not receive aid until they pledged to hold a public referendum on joining NATO. Can a President set such conditions on Congressional approved aid?  2. Specific to the ongoing Ukraine story with President Trump, are there any legal issues raised when a President asks a foreign nation to investigate US citizens? What about political opponents, other groups?  3. On question two, does adding the layer of withholding appropriated Congressional aid complicate that legal analysis?
State pension funds run the gamut of being more than 100% funded to having around a 1/3 budgeted. How do states that have not fully funded their pension programs makeup the difference? Are there any advantages/disadvantages to a state for fully funding their pension system? States like South Dakota and Wisconsin have fully budgeted [pension programs](https://taxfoundation.org/state-pension-plan-funding-2019/), while Kentucky only has 34% planned.   Kentucky is not alone in under funding its pension program:  > Twenty states have pension plans that are less than two-thirds funded, and five states have pension plans that are less than 50 percent funded.  ---  1. How do states that have not fully funded their pension programs makeup the difference?   2. Are there any advantages/disadvantages for states that fully fund their pension programs?
[Mod Post] Canada election information For those not aware, there is currently a Canadian election ongoing.  Election day is Monday October 21.  **Voting Information**  [Elections Canada has detailed information on the logistics of voting.](https://elections.ca/home.aspx)  If you are a Canadian citizen and 18 or older, you are legally entitled to vote.  Early voting, absentee voting, and same day registration are available.  **Change from prior elections: voters who live abroad**    There is no longer any requirement to have lived in Canada recently to be able to vote.  In January this year, [the Supreme Court ruled](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/17446/index.do) that Canadian citizens are entitled to vote at their last address in Canada no matter how long they have been outside the country.  So if you are a long-term Canadian expatriate, you can [apply to be on the International Register of Electors](https://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=vot&dir=reg/etr&document=index&lang=e) and cast your ballot by mail.  **Change from prior elections: formally organized leader debates.**  Newly formed for this election, the [Leader's Debates Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaders%27_Debates_Commission) is organizing a pair of debates, in English and French, among party leaders.  The English debate is Monday, October 7.  The French debate is Thursday, October 10.  **How elections in Canada work**  There will be a First Past the Post election for [all 338 seats in the House of Commons.](https://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?dir=ces&document=part1&lang=e&section=res) Each seat represents one geographic district, called a “riding,” which represents a specific area within a province (or in the case of the territories, the entire territory).  Candidates generally affiliate with a political party.  If a single party wins the majority of seats [it will form government by convention.](https://www.ourcommons.ca/marleaumontpetit/DocumentViewer.aspx?Sec=Ch01&Seq=2&Language=E)  If no party wins a majority, then parties may negotiate to form a coalition, or the party with a plurality of seats may seek to from a minority government, which it can do as long as it does not lose a vote of no confidence.  ---  Pour ceux qui ne le savent pas, une élection canadienne est en cours.

Si un seul parti remporte la majorité des sièges, [il formera un gouvernement par convention.](https://www.noscommunes.ca/marleaumontpetit/DocumentViewer.aspx?Sec=Ch01&Seq=2&Language=F) Si aucun parti ne remporte la majorité, les partis peuvent alors négocier pour former une coalition ou le parti ayant la majorité relative peut chercher à obtenir un  gouvernement minoritaire, ce qu'il peut faire tant qu'il ne perd pas une motion de censure.
Does the denial of the testimony of Rick Dearborn and Rob Porter, as well as the curtailing of the testimony of Corey Lewandowski amount to open obstruction of justice by the Trump Administration? Today the White House submitted letters effectively blocking the testimony of [Rick Dearborn and Rob Porter](https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/democrats.judiciary.house.gov/files/documents/Nadler2.9.16.2019%20WHletter%20on%20Rick%20Dearborn%20and%20Rob%20Porter.pdf). This was in conjunction with the Department of Justice, which issued statements from the Office of Legal Counsel granting [Dearborne](https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/democrats.judiciary.house.gov/files/documents/OLC%20-%20Rick%20Dearborn%20Testimonial%20Immunity%20-%2009.16.2019%20%28002%29.pdf) and [Porter](https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/democrats.judiciary.house.gov/files/documents/OLC%20-%20Rob%20Porter%20Testimonial%20Immunity%2009.16.2019%20%28002%29.pdf) testimonial immunity following subpoenas from the House Judiciary Committee. Dearborn and Porter were White House aides that were cited repeatedly in [the Mueller Report](https://apps.npr.org/documents/document.html?id=5955997-Muellerreport), and their testimony to the Special Counsel's Office is publicly available.  Today, Corey Lewandowski is still being questioned on the floor of the House Judiciary Committee concerning his testimony in the Mueller Report. Lewandowski, Trump's former campaign manager and continued associate within the Trump White House has repeatedly cited another [White House letter](https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/democrats.judiciary.house.gov/files/documents/Nadler.1.9.16.2019%20WH%20letter%20re%20Corey%20Lewandowski.pdf) stating he is being compelled not to answer pertinent questions leveled at him by members of the House Judiciary Committee. Lewandowski's testimony is also a matter of public record, recorded within the pages of the [the Mueller Report](https://apps.npr.org/documents/document.html?id=5955997-Muellerreport).  Highly relevant to these developments is the actual content of the Mueller Report. Significant evidence stands within the Mueller Report highlighting conduct that is [widely perceived as potential obstruction of justice by over 1000 former Federal Prosecutors](https://medium.com/@dojalumni/statement-by-former-federal-prosecutors-8ab7691c2aa1), pending congressional action. Inspection by legal experts has revealed that Mueller laid forth evidence in [Volume II, sections E, F, I, and J](https://www.lawfareblog.com/obstruction-justice-mueller-report-heat-map), indicating significant evidence supporting all three elements of the charge:  1. An Obstructive Act 2. Nexus to a pending or contemplated official Proceeding 3. Corrupt Intent (see [Mueller Report](https://apps.npr.org/documents/document.html?id=5955997-Muellerreport): Vol. II pp. 9, 10 for a full description of these elements).  The same legal analysis indicates evidence in sections B, D, J [see Roger Stone redacted content], and K [see Cohen Cooperation] could also possibly support the fulfillment of all three elements of obstruction of justice. The final interpretation of the Mueller Report that would lead to any potential official action against the President is still a matter of congressional responsibility as the [Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel opinion](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/olc/opinions/2000/10/31/op-olc-v024-p0222_0.pdf) states: > The indictment or criminal prosecution of a sitting President would unconstitutionally undermine the capacity of the executive branch to perform its constitutionally assigned functions.  Mr. Mueller and his team have therefore taken it as their instruction to not consider any possible indictments and only lay forth the verifiable acts as they found them.  My questions are as follows:  1. Is the Department of Justice operating within legal precedent to grant testimonial immunity to White House aides who have already testified to investigators and whose testimony is already a matter of public record? 2. Does the White House have the legal authority to instruct Corey Lewandowski, a private citizen, to not comply with the questioning of the House Judiciary Committee? 3. Is there any previous precedent where a private citizen submitted to a subpoena issued by a Special Counsel's Office, but did not answer the ensuing questions from members of the House of Representatives? 4. Finally, should this new method of shielding Lewandowski and White House aides from rigorous congressional questioning be itself an area of constitutional concern for this congress?
US Presidential candidate Andrew Yang is giving $1,000 monthly payments to 13 US families. Is this a violation of campaign finance law? Presidential candidate Andrew Yang has proposed a [Universal Basic Income of $1,000 a month](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2019/aug/12/andrew-yangs-universal-basic-income-proposal-expla/).  > Under Yang’s proposal, every American over 18 would receive a payment from the government for $1,000 a month, or $12,000 a year.  ---  To prove that this is an effective policy, [Andrew Yang's campaign has been paying $1,000 a month to three US families](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/andrew-yang-give-1000-month-10-families-part/story?id=65580772), and [recently announced](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/12/andrew-yang-says-he-will-give-1000-a-month-ubi-to-10-more-families.html) he will select 10 more. All 13 recipients will receive the payments for a full year, or a direct transfer of $12,000 to each.  These [may or may not](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/12/us/politics/andrew-yang-debate-payments.html) be campaign finance violations, but with the [potential that they are](https://time.com/5675823/andrew-yang-freedom-dividend-election-law/), I'm curious about a few things:  ---  1. What are the arguments being made that these payments constitue a campaign finance violation?  2. How does the FEC determine if such payments constitute a campaign finance violation? What are the legal questions to be answered?  3. If determined to be a violation, what would the FEC's next step in the process be?  4. As I've mentioned in [another post,](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/d4b9kd/as_of_august_30th_the_federal_election_commission/) the FEC is [unable to quorum] (https://www.npr.org/2019/08/30/755523088/as-fec-nears-shutdown-priorities-such-as-stopping-election-interference-on-hold) right now, so if this issue falls to another body and they determine a violation took place, will they have any kind of enforcement mechanism?
As of August 30th, the Federal Election Commission (FEC) does not have enough commissioners to hold a quorum. Unable to hold a quorum, the FEC cannot enforce campaign finance law. Is campaign finance law unenforceable until the FEC quorums? The Federal Election Commission (FEC) currently can't hold a quorum due to a lack of commissioners. Unable to quorum, the [FEC can't conduct regular business](https://www.npr.org/2019/08/30/755523088/as-fec-nears-shutdown-priorities-such-as-stopping-election-interference-on-hold), such as enforcement of campaign finance law, or acting as an advisory to campaigns about following election law:  > Friday [Aug. 30, 2019] will be the last business day that the Federal Election Commission will be able to function for quite a while, leaving the enforcement of federal campaign finance laws unattended ahead of the 2020 election.  > ...  > In addition to collecting campaign finance data, the FEC investigates potential campaign finance violations, issues fines and gives guidance to campaigns about following election law — but not without a working quorum of at least four commissioners.  ---  I have a couple of questions on this topic:  1. Aside from the FEC, does any regulatory body, State or Federal, have the ability to investigate presidential candidates for campaign finance violations?  2. What other Federal election laws are under the purview of FEC, and how is their enforcement affected by the FEC's inability to quorum?
What are the costs and benefits of nuclear power (as opposed to other green sources of energy such as wind and solar) as it stands now? United States Presidential Candidate Bernie Sanders recently released his plan to move away from carbon emissions with the Green New Deal. The plan omits any plans for investment in nuclear energy, and instead opts mostly for ways such as solar or wind energy https://berniesanders.com/issues/the-green-new-deal/  Is there any reason that nuclear should or shouldn't be a part of any plans as ambitious as this one? Also, how does nuclear stack up against wind in solar in terms of efficiency, safety and viability?

What are the pros and cons of AB5? AB5 puts into law a California Supreme Court decision making it harder for companies to classify workers as independent contractors. ...

It explicitly states that network drivers would not be classified as employees.  Pay: Drivers would be guaranteed weekly pay averaging at least 1.27 times minimum wage in the city where the ride or delivery started.

For example, is there any clarity on whether future Social Security payments are a certain Federal financial obligation?  2. Are these potential liabilities formally used in rating the security of US treasury bonds?
The Arizona GOP, amongst others, has officially cancelled their 2020 primary. What consequences could arise from this? [This article](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/460552-arizona-gop-opts-of-2020-nominating-contest) states that the GOP in Arizona, Kansas and South Carolina have all cancelled their primaries in 2020, meaning that Donald Trump will not be opposed in these states when seeking re-nomination for the party. Nevada has been named as another state which will reportedly follow suit.  Whilst this is not the first time that individual states have opted to cancel their primaries, with the same article stating that the Democratic Party in Arizona didn’t hold primaries during the 2012 election, in the past did any consequences arise from this decision? Could the GOP be forced to hold primaries in these states by a legal challenge?   Thanks.
The US Constitution Article 2 Section 3 appears to give the president the ability to adjourn congress. Has this ever been used? In light of Brexit discussions on [proroguing](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-48936711) where [parliament has been suspended seemingly to prevent interference in the Brexit proceeding,](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-49604584)  Article 2 describes the powers of the executive, under section 3 it appears a number of responsibilities are listed including   > [...he may, on extraordinary Occasions, convene both Houses, or either of them, and in Case of Disagreement between them, with Respect to the Time of Adjournment, he may adjourn them to such Time as he shall think proper...](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript#toc-section-3--2)  Is congress today ever at risk of disagreeing on what time they adjourn, and if so, has a president ever exercised their right to forcibly adjourn congress in the case of such disagreement?  Further, what prevents a party in power of at least one house and the presidency from conspiring to disagree on adjournment and let the president adjourn congress at some opportune time? Have other laws superseded and/or made this executive power irrelevant?
The Trump Administration is investigating automakers for agreeing with California on emissions standards. Is this a legitimate antitrust issue? Today [The Wall Street Journal reported](https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-launches-antitrust-probe-into-four-auto-makers-11567778958) that the US Department of Justice is investigating Ford, Honda, BMW, and Volkswagen on antitrust grounds, alleging that their jointly announced agreement with California state officials to comply with stricter California emissions requirements.    [Second article descrbing the DoJ move because WSJ is paywalled](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/06/doj-launches-antitrust-probe-over-auto-emissions-deal-with-california-wsj-reports.html)  The [framework was announced this past July](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2019/07/25/california-and-major-automakers-reach-groundbreaking-framework-agreement-on-clean-emission-standards/) and [binds the four automakers to 3.7% annual emissions reductions (or 2.7% with certain technology credits.)](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/sites/default/files/2019-07/Auto%20Terms%20Signed.pdf)  Is there any precedent for an agreement between multiple firms and a government agency being an antitrust violation?
What are the arguments for/against privatizing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac? [The Trump administration has recently revealed a plan to privatize Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fannie-mae-freddie-mac-privatization-trump-administration-unveils-plan-to-privatize-mortgage-finance-giants/)     [Fannie Mae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fannie_Mae) and [Freddie Mac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Mac) were financial services founded by Congress whose purpose was to facilitate the mortgage market and make homes more affordable. [Originally, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were privately held, but during the 2008 Recession they were placed into conservatorship by the Federal government.](https://www.fhfa.gov/Conservatorship/Pages/History-of-Fannie-Mae--Freddie-Conservatorships.aspx)   What are the arguments for and against privatizing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac?
What evidence is there to suggest that the NRA could be classified as a terrorist organization? [The San Francisco Board of Supervisors has declared the National Rifle Association a "domestic terrorist organization."](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/sf-board-of-supervisors-declare-nra-a-domestic-terrorist-organization/ar-AAGM1YH) The resolution:  - cites "an epidemic of gun violence" - refers to the US Department of Justice's definition of terrorism, "The use of any...explosive, firearm, or other weapon or dangerous device, with intent to endanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals or to cause substantial damage to property;" - claims that the NRA uses its influence to "incite violence," "spreads propaganda that misinforms and aims to deceive the public about the dangers of gun violence," and "promotes extremist positions."  [The U.S. Code defines "domestic terrorism" as:](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2331)  > the term “domestic terrorism” means activities that— > (A) involve acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any State; > (B) appear to be intended— >   (i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; >   (ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or >   (iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and > (C) occur primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States; and  - From which Department of Justice document is the San Francisco Board of Supervisors citing the definition of terrorism? (I did a cursory web search, but most of the results were from news of the NRA's classification and I could not find the source of the definition.) - Does the NRA meet the definition of a terrorist organization? - Are there any examples of the NRA spreading misinformation, inciting violence, or fuelling extremism?
What are the reasons for not automatically granting citizenship for babies born to US Citizens abroad? The rule appears to primarily affect the children of naturalized US citizens serving in the armed forces who have not lived in the US for a required period of time, a relatively small number -- estimated to be approximately 100 annually, according to a Defense Department official. It does not impact anyone born in the United States.   What makes this change necessary? Was there abuse? Who, if anyone, benefits from this change?   https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/28/politics/us-military-employee-citizenship-rule/index.html
What are the Implications of the Queen's Suspension of Parliament? As someone from the US, I'm curious to learn more about what it means to have the Queen suspend Parliament (https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-49493632). Some more specific questions include:  Who will be in charge of the government and its decisions while Parliament is suspended? Are these powers given to an individual, to a committee, or anything more broad?  How long does the suspension of Parliament last?  Has this ever happened before to set a precedent that we could expect to be followed?  How could this most likely affect the outcome of Brexit with regards to creating a deal or having a no-deal Brexit? (I imagine this is closely related to the first question of who will be in charge now)  What are the constitutional concerns relating to the Queen's suspension of Parliament?
Can the President Order Firms to Leave China? US President Donald Trump [tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1164914959131848705) on Friday that he is ordering US firms to find an alternative to China and bring their business home to America.  Over the weekend, Trump [asserted](https://www.apnews.com/be18b8619cde4658a418dda4f416968a) that he holds such broad power thanks to the [International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Emergency_Economic_Powers_Act), a piece of legislation signed by President Jimmy Carter.  My questions:  1. What precedent, if any, supports Trump's position that POTUS can use a national emergency declaration to regulate and compel international trade? Or are there any precedents against the view? 2. What is the legal process by which an administration executes that law's provisions? 3. In light of the fact that China contributes billions to the earnings of US corporations like Apple, how could US firms challenge Trump's supposed legal authority if he does execute the order? 4. What can Congress and the courts do to stop Trump from attempting the sweeping order on trade?
Can the President forgive student debt? I saw [this article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-signs-memo-to-eliminate-disabled-veterans-student-loan-debt/) today, President Trump signed a memo ordering the US Dept. of Education to forgive all federal student loans/debt for disabled veterans. Given that many of the Democratic candidates running for President have their own plans for student loan cancellation (most notably [Sen. Warren](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/24/elizabeth-warren-2020-student-loan-debt-1428361) and [Sen. Sanders](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/24/bernie-sanders-2020-student-loan-debt-forgiveness-plan-1296863)) it leads to me question whether proposed plans for student loan forgiveness for all borrowers can be implemented and enforced in a similar fashion.  My Questions:  * What are the legal paths and executive powers that a sitting president can use without congressional legislation to forgive any amount of student debt? * Are there prior examples of US Presidents forgiving student loan debt that did not require congressional approval?  Edit: After some more diving, I found not all news sources mentioned this, but [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2019/08/21/753213306/trump-signs-executive-order-forgiving-all-federal-student-loan-debt-for-disabled) gave a good explanation, there is an existing student loan forgiveness program for disabled veterans where this stems from.  Since the president did act within his power, could that be extended to other programs such as the [Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF)](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service)? It seems there is room for presidential action for that program since [99% of Public Service Loan Forgiveness Applications Get Rejected](https://learn.g2.com/public-service-loan-forgiveness)
