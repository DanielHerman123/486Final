Florida has moved rapidly to the right that is obvious with the recent re-elections but in my opinion one set of disastrous elections should not cause a complete write off of the state especially when many democrats did not get out and vote. Even if it is a red state it‚Äôs not a Wyoming or West Virginia(which has a democrat senator I know I know but he did pass inflation reduction act) so is it possible for like a jon tester candidate in Florida? Also bill Nelson was a senator for ages before losing by a razor thin margin to Rick Scott who is not popular. Also Biden only lost to trump by a few points and DeSantis and Rubio were very popular in the country. Other reasons include Florida democrats did a bad job and National democrats didn‚Äôt lend enough support. By the way Republican voter registration only recently overtook registered democrats. And I think the DeSantis craze will end since he‚Äôs term limited isn‚Äôt he, he can‚Äôt serve more than 2 consecutive terms right? And his ambitions lie elsewhere. Is Florida at all regain-able eg could a good democrat oust Rick Scott in 2024?",0

"How do you think the prosecution of Trump might affect the 2024 election?
Today I was listening to an NPR interview with a NYT columnist and a Bulwark columnist who were both arguing that that case against Trump is weak. It made me recall the midterms... Remember how Democrats contributed to the campaigns of MAGA Republicans because that would be an easier general election challenge to defeat? That ended up paying off as MAGA messaging continues to be a losing strategy. Perhaps the prosecution of Trump will have a similar effect on the 2024 election. The GOP will have to rally behind Trump during the proceedings lest they be chastised by the base, stifling any possibility of competition to Trump in the primaries. Biden has already beat Trump before, so even if Trump can wiggle out of this one and makes it to the general election...better the devil you know...

Hi reddit I am in dire need of a good venting and maybe some stories or discussions on how you all are managing during these trying times. Anyway this morning my 8 year old son was misbehaving before school (running around the yard not getting into the car....tried throwing his book bag in our pool etc) anyway I yelled at him little louder and more than I think I should have. It wasn't too bad and I know he is okay. But I feel guilty. What if God forbid there is another shooting and it's him today? I am in tears thinking of other mothers who may have had a bad morning and never got to say sorry. Almost daily I worry when I drop my kids off if I'm making a mistake leaving them there. It's even starting to worry me going to the store. Nowhere is safe. Nowhere. I lost my mother at a very young age and my father when I was 20. Sisters when I was too young to remember them. So all the loss I  have suffered im sure is adding to my worry but I just find myself being afraid to take my kids anywhere but home. Is anyone else feeling this way sometimes? How do you cope with it? What can any of us do to feel or be safer? I do not like guns but my SO has a pistol for protection we usually leave at home but I don't think a gun is going to save us from a gun you know. What can we do?

"Why Republicans Are Doomed
I believe that the Republican Party, as we know it, will be hollowed out. It will be a slow process that will play out over the next generation or two, and we have already seen it begin. Last year's midterms were one of the weakest performances by an opposing party in recent history. What is especially remarkable is that this occurred while the president's approval rating was underwater. 

College-educated are leaving the Republican party. In 2000, 23% of Democrats had a college degree. Today, it is 48%. For Republicans, it is virtually unchanged from 30% to 31%. Imagine a time when Republicans were the educated party! College-educated voters are reliable voters. These are the people that will get out and vote during midterms.

Religion is declining in America, which is true in both parties. There will come a point in time when the Republican party will go to war with itself. It might be soon. Less than 2 in 3 Republicans consider religion to be important in their lives. The religious right considers their religion to be the core of their belief system. It gives them their moral justification to commit hateful acts against vulnerable groups of people. If the declining trend in religious affiliation continues, the religious right will find itself to be a minority within its own party.

The generational divide is beginning to grow. Millennials are not growing more conservative as they age. This trend is likely to continue in succeeding generations. Over half of millennials identify as Democrat or lean Democrat, but only about 1 in 3 millennials identify as Republican or lean Republican. People are better educated and are better able to reject conservative principles which cause harm to minorities and other vulnerable groups.

In time, the Republican party will probably eventually recover, but not before the very identity of the party has been stripped bare and exposed for the country to see. A reckoning is coming for the Republican party, and it will not be pretty. So sit back, grab some popcorn, and enjoy the show.",0

"What do liberals think of China and US-China relations?
As a liberal Democrat, I have mixed feelings about China. My gut reaction to seeing Republican leaders badmouth China is to think we shouldn't do that and we should aim to make US-China relations as good as possible, especially relations with their (now effectively dictator or President with no term limits) leader Xi Jinping. On the other hand, maybe some of the bad things Republican leaders say about China has some merit. Like maybe China really is a dictatorship with an overpowered, top-down authoritarian government. China has vastly more public video cameras than any other country on Earth and those video cameras are hooked into a centralized Artificial Intelligence system that captures, stores, and identifies all the faces it sees (see [Mass Surveillance In China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_surveillance_in_China)). Like the authorities in China can take a photo of anyone's face (or pull a photo from one of the cameras), upload it, and it will show when and where in the country that face was seen and it will be able to look up that person's identity, for example from ID photos, mugshots, and everywhere on the internet where photos of that person exist. They claim this system is to deter crime, but it's a little discomforting. There have been reports of them placing these cameras observing the entrances of homes of people who disagree with the government. I even read a story about the Chinese government trying to use brain scans hooked into AI to check for loyalty to the government. On the other side, after 9/11 the US set up surveillance systems on ordinary Americans like the recording of all phone calls, so it's not like the US is spotless when it comes to surveillance of its citizens. If the US really wants information on someone it can request that information from private companies like Google, Apple, Facebook, AT&T, etc. I heard that in China there isn't the division between private corporations and the government that exists in the US, but it's not like the US doesn't get info on private citizens from corporations in cases of things like actual or suspected crimes, terrorism, etc.


Then there's China denying that Taiwan is a separate country with its own democratic government (they split in the past after a war) and possibly invading Taiwan, sparking a military conflict. Then there's the persecution and mistreatment of Muslim Uighurs. On the other hand, during WW2 the American government effectively put all the Japanese in prison (""internment camps"") and obviously the US has a history of slavery, plus remember all the Muslim civilians who were killed in the US's wars in the Middle East, so it's not like we the US is unequivocally morally superior to China.

One thing that concerns me is the Chinese internet is closed off to public US websites like Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, Instagram, the New York Times, etc. Like the Chinese people don't have access to the outside internet, so the Chinese government can set the narrative and there is no visible counter-narrative. This is what's happening in Russia, with support for Putin still strong as they don't know the truth about the war in Ukraine.

On the other hand, even though China is a dictatorship, it is a left-wing, supposedly pro-proletariat ""people's dictatorship"", so maybe they have some stuff in common with the left wing in the US? I honestly don't know if China is neutral, friend, or foe.

One more thing. I don't know if there are some advantages that such a centralized, top-down system has over a spread-out, more bottom-up, more democratic system. Like maybe China has the capacity to out-pace the US in certain forms of research because Xi Jinping can just allocate resources and people-power to specific things without having to go through the democratic process. I don't know.

More revelations come out in the Dominion lawsuit.

Again, I'm not understanding - is he just doing this for ratings when he clearly doesn't believe his lies? And is Fox News really ""News"" if they aren't even covering this lawsuit?

"LEGAL Gun Ownership /Weapon Ownership should not be a Left vs Right Issue at all, the left needs to utilize the second amendment
 It is perfectly fine and reasonable to use a weapon to defend yourself in your home from criminals. People always say ""just call the police"" but what do you think the police have? The police will go into an apartment with 30 well-built men, all of them holding guns, body armor, and whatever to protect their lives. The police don't tell the guys to come out and ""fight like a man"" they shoot on sight. The government has no duty to protect you

[https://ehlinelaw.com/blog/do-police-have-a-duty-to-protect-me#:\~:text=True%2C%20Unless%20police%20have%20assumed,occur%2C%E2%80%9D%20said%20Darren%20L](https://ehlinelaw.com/blog/do-police-have-a-duty-to-protect-me#:~:text=True%2C%20Unless%20police%20have%20assumed,occur%2C%E2%80%9D%20said%20Darren%20L)

.

"" True, **Unless police have assumed a duty to protect you, they don't have one**. ‚ÄúNeither the Constitution nor state law, impose a general duty upon police officers or other government officials to protect individual persons from harm ‚Äî even when they know the harm will occur,‚Äù said Darren L. ""

Does anyone remember the Uvalde massacre? The police stood outside while kids were getting murdered because they were outgunned by one individual. Most of the time the police are not prepared to deal with heavily armed individuals. So if a criminal decided to fuck with you in your home and you don't have a gun, HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO PROTECT YOURSELF WHEN THE PEOPLE YOUR TAX DOLLARS GO TO, PROBABLY CAN'T EVEN PROTECT YOU.

You must take responsibility for the defense of your own life. Now does this mean I don't think there should be any gun laws? No. That would be ridiculous. I want background checks for guns. I want the training required to properly use a gun. Most importantly, I want people to treat guns as a last resort and an extension of their own homes.

**WHEN YOU ARE IN PUBLIC YOU SHOULD RETREAT. WHEN YOU ARE IN YOUR OWN HOME YOU CAN USE WHATEVER WEAPON NECESSARY TO CAUSE THE THREAT TO RETREAT, OR ATTACK THE THREAT IF HE COMES AFTER YOU.**

Seriously, start the legal paper work to get a gun as soon as possible. You can also check your state laws to see if you can carry around pepper spray. Pepper spray is far less lethal and a great defense for anyone who doesn't want to get into fisticuffs with strangers on the street. Men, women, non-binary, it doesn't matter who you are. There is no ""honor"" in this society. Get something to even the odds. There is no ""fight like a man"" for all the men out there, and you can't avoid every conflict through de-escalation, submission, or just talking someone down.

The government literally can't protect everyone. If you can't remember the guy's face, there is nothing the police can do. If there are no witnesses or cameras, nothing the police can do. If the police don't care, you will be screwed.

The democrats you vote for have armed security. Whenever the NRA protests or conservatives protest the police do not try to instigate with them. The police let them protest in peace or try to side with them. The well-regulated militia that the second amendment is supposed to provide has been high jacked by the republican party. They are brainwashed by fox news. At the end of the day they will follow orders and use their guns to make you submit.

"Debate Me (I'm bored üò≠)
Hello, I'm Aaron, a 16 y/o moderate conservative. I've not been into politics very long but I like to debate people with different views.

Personally I believe there is right and wrong in both sides of the political spectrum equally. Some basic things I support are things like racial equality, same-sex marriages, and improvements to education and social security networks. On the other hand, I believe the second amendment shouldn't be repealed and things like illegal immigration should be looked at more seriously. I believe in complete freedom of religion and speech but I believe no politician should act with religious bias, just as I believe no teacher should act with political bias. I am pro-choice until a few weeks into pregnancy once the embryo begins to properly develope, which then I turn pro-life. The most controversial opinion I have would probably be that I am against trans peoples, as the entire concept doesn't make sense in my eyes. Economically I lean further right than in most things. I believe federal spending should be cut down (See the United States massive debt issue) and in lowering taxes (Or at the very least, putting that money into something useful).

The biggest issue I believe in politics is the massive hypocrisies both sides make, and just how much hatred there is in the system. A compromise is not a bad thing, no matter how hard radicals try to make it seem. 

Well, my thumbs are getting tired, if you disagree anywhere or if I was too vague (I probably was), lemme know what you think and I'll give you my POV.

Marianne Williamson is likely to seek the Democratic nomination in 2024. Challenging Joe Biden,0
"I'm really worried that Biden may loose to DeSantis in 2024. Wanted to know other Liberal's thoughts.
I wanted to ask for people's opinion here on something that I am increasingly worried about.

I really like Biden, voted for him in the primary and general, and his approval rating shouldn't be this low considering how well he has led this country through the mess that it has been in since COVID. I'd be just fine with him serving a second term.

But what's most important to me now is that whoever wins in 2024 is a Democrat, not a Republican. If DeSantis wins, with Roe gone, he could pass executive orders to, say, ban millitary healthcare from providing reproductive care, or things like that, all without worrying about a filibuster.

Biden could easily defeat Trump, but DeSantis is a lot smarter, which makes him even worse. In the general, he would probably portray himself as ""a new generation of leadership for the future"" or some nonsense like that. I'm worried that the contrast alone between 82-year old Biden and 40-something DeSantis could prove to be devastating. If the economy hasn't caught up yet it could be even worse. Most voters wouldn't care.

It seems Biden is planning on running again, relying on the same playbook as he did in 2020. So nobody else is challenging him. But this isn't 2020. My best hope, if DeSantis wins the nomination, is that he and Trump tear each other apart and he is forced to go so far to the right on issues that it poisons his chance to win the election.

I'd like to ask for other people's opinion on this. Democrats don't seem to be talking about it much, especially after the midterms, but it is something that REALLY worries me. I like Biden, but I'd rather he end his career on a high note that end up loosing to some freedom-caucus anti-immigrant anti-LGBTQ anti-abortion culture warrior who is only popular because he charters flights from Texas to Massachusetts as some political stunt.

**TLDR**: I like Biden, but I REALLY don't wan't a Repub (like DeSantis) in 2024. I'm not sure Biden is the safest bet to prevent DeSantis or a non-Trump Repub from winning. That worries me. What are your thoughts? Do you agree or am I wrong?",0

"Old scheme to gut Social Security revisited.
 

Here they go again with a new conspiracy to undermine, if not completely kill Medicare and Social Security. Mike Pence recently gave a secretive speech in which he outlined the same scheme George Bush enunciated but was forced to abandon when the wheels fell off his proposal. 

It seems Pence is now conspiring with the likes of Steve Scalise, Rick Scott, Josh Hawley and a raft of Congressional Representatives who are owned by Wall Street to *disembowel the system.* 

The scheme is to allow future Social Security recipients to invest 2% of their money in the stock market. 2% doesn‚Äôt sound like much, but when considered over the broad expanse of Social Security system the withdrawal of that much money would certainly sink the program. 

Yes, at first blush it all seems good. And it would be if each future senior citizen was astute enough to hitch a ride on a rising market while bypassing a falling market; but what are the odds? One single major dip in the market could wipe out all gains in a heartbeat, and you would still have to pay fees on each purchase and sale to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. 

The brokerage houses don't give a damn if you win, or lose, you pay both ways! That‚Äôs why they are underwriting the plot with millions invested in the contrivance.¬† 

Ahh, but it doesn‚Äôt stop here. Last June, the Republican Study Committee, of which Scalise is a member, released a budget plan that included numerous suggested reforms for Medicare and Social Security, including raising the eligibility ages for each program to 67 and 70, respectively. The proposal further called for *withholding* *payments* for individuals who retire early or had a certain level of income, (your savings, investments and 401k) and also suggested using private funding sources to replace Medicare. 

‚ÄúPrivate funding sources‚Äù means private health insurance!. Private health insurance can be summed up in four words: ‚ÄúSorry, that‚Äôs a pre-existing condition.‚Äù 

As mentioned, Bush killed his plan because the market hit a downturn and lost over twenty-five percent and seniors gasped when they realized how much they would have lost from their benefits.

To the members of the Republican Congress:

Yes, joy was discovered in the sins of vindictiveness and retaliation. 

All the ammunition needed for this pursuit has been provided to the Justice Department by the Select Committee and, as in hearing after hearing, they learned the names of the authors and the plan of sedition and heard it from Republicans themselves. 

For only the second time in history, some Americans turned against, and betrayed their country, and for this they will be harshly punished. 

There will be only fitful sleep for these traitors. They are now quaking with trepidation, fearing the moment when their names will be mentioned, and their crimes exposed. Fearing the condemning glance of their family members who will live in shame for generations, fearing the inevitable bankruptcy caused by predatory lawyers and the huge fines they face, and fearing being imprisoned with hardened criminals who will use them as sex toys. 

And for what? Influence, prestige, money, the affirmation of like-minded scum? Hardly a good trade-off. 

As mentioned, there are at least eighty-one million Democrats, plus loyal, patriotic American Republican and Independent voters, and the insurrectionists will feel the weight of unwavering might.

Have you ever wondered how life insurance companies make so much money?

The US government uses these same types of charts to keep the CDC and other agencies up to date with a similar formula. 

There seems to be a contrarian streak in many people, a refusal to accept verifiable facts -- despite all the evidence ‚Äì and they remain resolute in their obduracy and firm in their unfounded convictions, 

Perhaps they think it makes them seem smart, well-informed and it gives them a sense of pleasure to stick their finger in the eye of conventional belief; *whatever.* 

A common example of this syndrome are right-wing claims that reported deaths from Covid are exaggerated, that many deaths caused by other diseases, even accidents, are attributed to Covid. Why they choose to believe this with no evidence to back it up, is beyond me; but again, *whatever.* 

To refute this silliness, I point to a government study in July of ‚Äò21 that clearly shows in the period between Feb. of ‚Äò20 and Jan. ‚Äò21 there were 100,000 deaths that couldn‚Äôt be attributed to anything other than Covid.

"Raising wages
My friend was saying that since places like McDonald‚Äôs are franchises, when wages are raised the money isn‚Äôt coming from a giant corporation but from the franchise owner. When I googled how much the average franchise owner makes, it said $150,000.

In the past, when politicians weren't so brazen in their lies about their political opponents, it was considered unseemly to pursue legal action for libel and slander against political opponents.  The courts provided a **lot** of latitude in political discourse that was tangential to the truth.  In those times, that made sense.  We don't live in those times.

"Public money for public schools.
If one had to point to a single issue as to what made America great, it just might be our public school education system. It guarantees every child the opportunity to advance at one‚Äôs own level with no restriction on what one might achieve, providing they have the ability to maintain reasonable standards of productivity. 

Even though America‚Äôs most challenging period, Jim Crow, when black children were segregated and shunted aside to ‚ÄòSeparate, but equal‚Äô schools, (Which were separate, but not at all equal) a basic level of learning was realized. 

*Public* funding (tax dollars) provided the wherewithal to fund *public* *schools,* and although challenged by problems that beset any large institution it did achieve, according to the Census Bureau, a literacy rate of 86%, at near the top of all the nations of the world. 

But now a dual education proposal is challenging the public system all across America; the threat? Vouchers! 

The scheme is as simple as this. The proponents intend to siphon off tax dollars meant for public education and divert it to private academies and prep schools that cater to the well-to-do, and the wealthy. They hire public relations firms to concoct ridiculous stories about a grassroots movement supporting the plot, when in fact right-wing plutocrats fund the program in order to further the separations between the rich and the poor. 

Each day we read about heroic, *underpaid,* teachers and administrators reaching into their own pockets just to provide the basics, pencils, and paper, for their already underfunded schools. But now, with pristine arrogance, and even before those items can be procured, they want the public dollars to go to travel lacrosse teams and racing shells for their already privileged children. 

And to make matters worse, there is no accountability for those funds. Whereas public schools have to meet certain standards of learning, give tests, adhere to standards, and face sanctions if goals aren‚Äôt reached, no such rules apply to most voucher projects.

I'm a registered Democrat and generally have liberal views across the board, socially and economically.

That said, I became fascinated by disinformation in 2020 and sought out the ""least biased"" news. I landed on PBS NewsHour and, to a lesser extent, NPR as well. (Though, I may be biased to the digestibility that is NewsHour's tidy hour-long nightly newscast M-F, and an easy 30 minutes that is NewsHour Weekend on Sat and Sun. I suppose there's a reason that NewsHour is the longest-running American news program, going strong for nearly 50 years.)

I'll turn on Newsmax in order to know exactly what drek they're promoting. With the recent hubbub of DirecTV dropping Newsmax 1 year after they dropped OANN, I noticed the same talking points were being parroted over and over again, in particular by R congressmen, that DirecTV carries ""22 liberal channels"", which supposedly dwarfs the number of conservative networks.

I've attempted to find this list of 22 channels but have come up empty. It's true that the mainstream news channels skew slightly left-center, but I wouldn't call CBS, ABC, and NBC intrinsically ""liberal"".

Both sides of the political spectrum seem to be getting more extreme. I feel like on either side you can't so much as even question why someone holds a certain view without being called a bigot (if you question the left) or woke (if you question the right). Even if the question comes from a place of attempting to understand/deepen understanding rather than challenging.

I like to discuss and hear different points of view even if they are something I might consider offensive or incorrect I still will listen to it.

"THE WHEELS OF JUSTICE...
These are long days and torturous nights for Paul Gosar and Kelli Ward, both of whom have shown support for the insurrectionists at the United States Capitol.¬† 

The Justice Department is deep into multiple investigations, investigations bolstered by evidence provided by the Jan. 6th Committee of the failed coup attempt, and they now possess a ‚Äòlandslide of evidence 'most of which comes from cell phones seized by the FBI.¬† 

They have recovered a treasure-trove of information from the phones of Giuliani, Eastman, Scott Perry, Mike Lindell, Boris Eashteyn, Victoria Toensing, (both Giuliani advisors) Michael McDonald, and Jeffrey Clarke, just to name a few. 

For a few brief moments this week, the sugar plums of sedition again danced in congressional heads when the courts issued a hold on Scott Perry‚Äôs phone. Ah, but the funny thing about telephones is they are two-way devices. 

In the heat of the insurrection phone calls, text messages, and emails flew about the government like newspapers on a New York City Street in a windstorm, but unlike the newspapers, these have been collected, collated. and compiled into binders related to specific schemes and to specific personages, to overthrow our democracy. 

Schemes like mounting a concerted effort to invalidate a legitimate vote, schemes like falsifying a slate of phony electors to change the vote, and most insidious of all, a scheme to replace a recalcitrant Attorney General with a stooge who would claim he sees irregularities in the election and will have the military seize the voting machines where, God knows, what would be done to them. 

Yes, there are heavy heads on pillows as the Justice Department completes its mission. Gosar and Ward aren‚Äôt the only ones sleeping a fitful sleep, they are joined by Mo Brooks, Louie Gohmert, Matt Gaetz, Andy Biggs, Josh Hawley, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Mark Meadows, Jim Jordan, Tom Cotton, Mike Lee, Lauren Boebert, Jim Banks, and others in their sweat-soaked tossing and turning.

"[Hayek, Friedmann, Classic Liberal Theory] Are there valid reasons to subsidies Energycosts for consumers
Hey friends,

Context:

‚Ä¢ In Germany we have introduced subsidies to cap gas prices to 12ct per united for consumers. The difference between market price and the 12ct per unit is payed for by tax-money.

‚Ä¢ To incentivise conserving gas, this mechanism only works up to 80% (insentive: Safe 20%) of your gas-use in 2022. What is above that needs to be payed for by the consumer alone.

‚Ä¢ Providers are legally forced to explain any rise in their retail price on gas in 2023 in fine detail, so that they can't artificially rise them to get more subsidies.

‚Ä¢ There is no legal mechanism that forces providers to lower their prices.

In effect:

‚Ä¢ This lowers the effective gas-costs for consumers on their bill, which is good.

‚Ä¢ This uses up enourmous amounts of taxpayer money, which is reasonably bad.

‚Ä¢ This eradicates any incentive for customers to seek out a (slightly) cheaper gas providers, which is bad. (Reason: Doesn't matter to you, as you pay 12cents max per unit either way. And it's unlikely anyone can provide for lower)

‚Ä¢ It takes most incentives away from providers to lower their prices (because consumers don't really care), which is bad.

‚Ä¢ This encourages providers to keep their prices high (as this grants them more ‚Ç¨ per subsidised unit), which is bad.

The question:

‚Ä¢ When we look at classic liberal theory, can there be an argument for any sort of ""gas-price-break"" as it's called? Maybe a very low conservative cap at 50% of your former gas-use to uphold market pressures while also sustaining (more) buying power and general situation of the people?

‚Ä¢ What is the outlook for the economy if no subsidues are introduced? Lower prices but effectively more burden on consumers. Where are consumers supposed to get that money from? Bank loans or liquidating posessions? -> Is there a limit where the government should intervene before people fall into poverty (in classic liberal theory)?

‚Ä¢ Extra: Maybe any specific chapters I should read into?

"America's hopelessly dysfunctional political system needs a serious overhaul.
I'll preface this by saying, in the near term, all of the following proposals I'm about to introduce will, unfortunately, not happen, but I do still continue to harbor the hope that in the future (by 2030-2035) there will be enough support to make these transformative changes a reality on the pathway to make America a more inclusive, representative, fair democracy.

Reforming the Judicial Branch

1. Expand SCOTUS to 13 members from the current 9. Instead of lifetime appointments, all justices will be restricted to fixed 18 year terms; once their term is up, they will be obligated to leave the bench. To reduce the currently extreme political implications of the SCOTUS nomination process (that are almost entirely caused by arbitrary circumstances such as death or retirement of a justice) all presidents will get the chance to nominate 2 justices, regardless of their political affiliation, in an effort to increase impartiality and fairness to the highest court in the land, which are characteristics that have been severely lacking in recent years. Lastly, all SCOTUS justices will be required to adhere to a Code of Ethics, since (amazingly) SCOTUS remains the only entity in the federal judiciary not to have one. As a side note, I believe the ethics issue is very relevant given the composition of today's court (Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito etc.)
2. Expand the size of the lower federal courts: As important as the Supreme Court is, very few cases will ever make it there. Most of this country's legal problems are still solved in the lower federal courts. Many people don't realize that the current size and composition of this subset of the judiciary hasn't been updated in more than 20 years. With the current judiciary still overwhelmingly represented by white, often conservative males, it's become painfully obvious it doesn't represent the increasing diversity that America has. In addition to these issues, lower federal courts have become backlogged by increasing numbers of cases, plaintiffs, and claimants over recent decades, meaning important sentences for criminals or defendants in civil cases have to wait months for their cases to be heard before a judge.

Reforming the Legislative Branch

1. Fixing the U.S. Senate: The issues of the Senate go beyond the legislative filibuster. What gets done in the Senate these days? Almost nothing, except judicial and federal cabinet nominations it seems. The dysfunction in the Senate is particularly acute due to egregious Republican malapportionment. Democratic Senators currently represent 43 million more Americans than Republican Senators. A state like Wyoming has over 60 times the voting power compared to California, even though both states share 2 Senators. The issue of the Senate is really overlooked I feel, even among many Democrats. How to change this? A simple solution: do away with the ""2 Senator state rule"" and replace it with a proportional system. All Senators will be allocated to States based on their populations. For example: a state like Vermont or Wyoming would only get 1 Senator, while a state like California would get 12 or 13. The effects of malapportionment can also be mitigated by admitting the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico as States to give them the representation they deserve. Lastly, Senators will be restricted to two six year terms.
2. Dramatically expand the U.S. House and introduce proportional representation: did you know the current size of the House hasn't changed in almost 100 years? Yes, you read that correctly, as America's population has grown and diversified, the House has stayed fixed at 435 members. This is deeply concerning, because many overlooked communities in America today don't feel they have adequate representation. The solution is to expand the current House from 435 members to 735. Most importantly, all members will no longer be elected in ""winner take all"" districts but instead will be elected through a proportional system. The lines of these congressional districts will be drawn either by a non-partisan commission or by an A.I. process that attempts to make the districts as competitive as possible. Gerrymandering will be outlawed; state legislatures will no longer have the authority to draw the boundaries of congressional districts. House members will only be permitted to serve three two year terms.

Reforming the Executive Branch

1. Presidents will be elected by a nationwide popular vote, the Electoral College will be abolished. That is all.

Expanding Voting Rights

1. Federal legislation needs to be passed that would require states to, among other things: make Election Day a national holiday, require same day voter registration for federal elections, expand the voter franchise to convicted felons (states will no longer be allowed to deny felons the right to vote), expand opportunities for vote by mail, require all states to have at least two weeks for early voting, reform the campaign finance system by incorporating a public financing option, reform provisions from the [DISCLOSE Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DISCLOSE_Act),[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_the_People_Act#cite_note-nytimes-11)[\[24\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_the_People_Act#cite_note-RuaneGill-24) which would impose stricter limitations on foreign lobbying, require [super PACs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_action_committee#Super_PACs) and other ""[dark money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_money)"" organizations to disclose their donors, and restructure the [Federal Election Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Election_Commission) to reduce partisan gridlock.

Here's how it works : we can directly give them da money for their work by salary control.

And for businesses the more money they get the more the prices, so we can lower them depending on the rarity and work involved.

Everyone single transaction will be online to counter curruption and bribing.

In this way, we have equality. Let's say I'm a youtuber depending on stuff like hard work, skills and innovation : I'll get my money and some of my money would be cut off and given to people who are paid less.

For example let's say the mining industry dose'nt generate alot but we need them then, we will give them the youtuber's money.

In our last episode of The Search For Kevin McCarthy's Spine, our lackluster protagonist had made concessions that all but guaranteed he'd hang on to the gavel for a day before being ousted and he still got pooched. In the NFL, if you're 0-ll to start, your season is OVER. By this time tomorrow, he'll be offering free kicks in the teeth just to get the Speakership, but seriously, he won't have any after grinding them in his sleep all week. Maybe if he grew a belly, painted himself orange and threw a dust bunny on his head he'd at least be able to beg for money instead of a wooden hammer. Maybe that dominatrix from  Fort Lauderdale can come up to D.C. and work him over because that's got to be less painful than the spankings he's been getting. What I really like is the statement from the Kevin Kamp between votes where there's one person who says, ""We're very optimistic"" EVERY SINGLE TIME. Translation: ""We're very myopic."" They can't see the forest for the axes being ground by 20 disgruntled seditionists. The fact is, Republicans don't really need a functioning government, not with so many staring down the barrel of a fully loaded Jack Smith. He didn't come to town to make friends. So this farce will continue until a few seats are shifted into a holding cell and some damn civility is brought back to chambers. Of course, Kevin's spine will have long vacated the premises by then, but that was always going to happen. Ah well, that's what you get for your thirty pieces, right? Karma, bitch.",0

   As liberals we have a horrible habit of doing what makes us feel better instead of playing to win. This is most prevalent in our messaging. We will have the winning argument but lose on messaging. Which I swear you almost have to try to do..lol

Why when you are  debating the  confederate flag/statues you should always go treason rather than slavery/ racism.


1)  both sides were TERRIBLE on both issues, so there really is only a marginal contrast to make...

2)  while the confederacy was absolutely formed to protect slavery, the US government did not fight to end it. They fought to stop the rebellion.

3) All the lost cause arguments are scripted around slavery , so when you go with treason they have no where to go.. slavery and racism are legitimately shakey arguments considering the above mentioned things, but treason is rock solid. In  fact they will continually keep bringing up their scripted slavery arguments when you haven't even mentioned slavery.

"How to Use Reddit to Positively Influence the World
I‚Äôve found an effective way to generate conversations and open people‚Äôs minds. I post high-quality articles on local subreddits both to inform people, and create opportunities for discussion. Sometimes there‚Äôs ignorant comments, but usually some informed and well-spoken Redditor will step in and deal with them.

Here‚Äôs what I do:

I enjoy reading the higher quality newspapers in my state. When I find something good, I share it. First on subreddit for that city/ region, then I crosspost to the state subreddit. Going local helps engage people who are turned off by national politics, or who might be brainwashed by bogus media outlets. Hyperpartisan media tend to only focus on national news, but can be outflanked by going local, because local papers haven‚Äôt been smeared as agents of the lizard people. If you don't have any good local papers, you could also use Google Alerts to catch reportage on your town.

The best results have these elements:

**Informative**

Go for long-form journalism that everyone would find interesting and worthwhile to read. Without being too jargony, the more research, facts, and analysis the article provides, the better. After reading it, it should be clear to the reader why they should care. Genuine understanding helps people feel calm and secure because they actually have useful knowledge to better navigate this crazy world. It works the opposite of alt-right media, which gives limited understanding and aims to provoke an emotional reaction. Give people something worth knowing. In order to refute an article, doubters will have to post contradictory information of the same quality, which might not exist. By pushing them to do some independent research, you‚Äôre effectively getting them to think for themselves instead of rehashing whatever Fox news says.

**Local Subs**

If an article specifically mentions a city or county, be sure to post it there. Posting articles on State subs will get more views, but the articles linger longer on city and regional subs. You could post on international subs too, but ideally you want a diverse group of people to see it, so avoid ideological subs. The intended audience is not the well-informed who go on Reddit daily (and who probably already lean left), but those who go on once a month or less. Many people use Reddit periodically just to find the answer to a problem. To have an impact, you want to reach people who aren‚Äôt already on your team. Yes, Reddit already has a selection bias, but the information you share will eventually find its way onto other social media and real life conversations.

**Non-partisan**

Facts don‚Äôt pick a side, and a good article will take aim at all parties that are wrong, left and right. People should feel they‚Äôre getting the real story, not a doctored version of it. If trolls claim an article is lizardman propaganda, kindly ask them for a link to another source. Keep the conversation focused on verified facts. Don‚Äôt get too drawn into debating with trolls. 

**Community- Building**

Articles that help people connect in real life are useful. Most bigots have limited exposure to different opinions and social backgrounds. Anything that helps reduce people‚Äôs social and intellectual isolation helps to put them on a better path by attacking the vacuum of awareness from which their bigotry was formed. Local events, clubs, businesses are all places where strangers can brush shoulders and get some insight. Articles referring to places, events, and memories we all have in common, help to build an inclusive sense of ‚Äúwe‚Äù. It helps to bridge the reality/ internet divide.

Here are some examples of the newspapers I post from:

"Would you vote for a presidential candidate with this platform?
I am going to post this on both conservative and liberal subs to gauge responses between both sides. I‚Äôm curious‚Ä¶

Here it goes.  

Candidate runs on one issue alone: money out of politics. PACs, corporate donations, funding political ads‚Ä¶all of it is illegal and punishable as treason. Each individual in the US is capped at donating $500 total for political contributions. 

-absolutely no investment interest for any public servant or immediate family members in the three branches of government while serving.  Any evidence of impropriety in this matter is punished on the level of treason. 

-4 year term limits. For everything. Stagger the expiration throughout the branches. Being a politician is no longer a career. If you‚Äôre over 65, you have two years to get out.  Going forward, 65 is the age limit for working in the three branches of government. 

-Any war effort voted on that passes subjects all those who vote yes to spend one month a year on the ground assisting the medics tending to the wounded and dying. (Originally I thought having them fighting on the front lines but I imagine this would actually put real soldiers in jeopardy being next to an out of shape politician in an actual engagement). 


-Pledges to only run for 1 term and pledges to never endorse or prop up any future candidate after that 1 term.  

-Will liquidate all assets over $250k prior to entering office (and voluntarily submit to a full financial audit made available to the public) and at the end of the term, voluntarily subject to another audit where any gains realized over that $250k are forfeited over to the government, and after(we‚Äôll call it the public servant tax).

-when inevitably asked about other stances on issues (abortion, immigration, economy, ect.), reiterate that the American people are going all in on reforming the corrupt system. We can‚Äôt address any of the above honestly while money is being exchanged. So I refuse to answer, and won‚Äôt do material legislation outside of getting money out of politicians hands. We‚Äôre going to spend four years cleaning house, and then I‚Äôm out of here and the American people can honestly fight for whatever they believe should be done. 

At least to me, if someone ran on this (Republican, Democrat, whatever) I‚Äôd vote for it. What are your thoughts?",0

"The Supreme Court is Immoral
# The Supreme court has become immoral

üì∑

Every individual has their own code of morality whether they belong to a religious or not. This is the same for societies and religions. When that code becomes dogma, when it does not allow for adaptation to better itself then that code becomes immoral. The entire premise that the constitution must be interpreted as the founding 'fathers' envisioned it is immoral. Fundamentalist by this definition are immoral and that is what the Catholic Church, the Evangelicals, the Federalists Society have become. When a species cannot adapt, cannot advance, it dies; it becomes extinct. There is always flux in an environment or society. Humans as a whole once only hunted and foraged and they migrated to follow their food source. Then they started growing foods that they manipulated to serve them better, settling the people in one place. Now most live in cities with a small number growing food and the vast majority specialize in widely variable occupations. Those different situations demand different social rules or codes of behavior. To force a code for a nomadic people or an agrarian society on those in an urban society is not adaptable or sane. There is a reason we feel as if we are living in an age of insanity.

Our current Supreme Court is working to force religious and political dogma on a country which does not benefits from either of those. In fact it is doing great harm. If we do not fix this problem our society, our democracy, our country may not survive.",0

My take on FrEeZe PeAcH: I've been mulling this over because I do think, in the abstract, free speech is desirable, and I don't want to be a hypocrite by wanting Nazis et. al. silenced. Here's what I've concluded:

I fully endorse your right to free speech.  The \_government\_ should have no ability to prevent you from speaking (barring ""fire"" in a theater and such).  However you do \_not\_ have a right to be heard. If I consider you harmful to society (and at this point I consider the vast majority of Republicans and those on the right to be this way) I feel no obligation to support \_your being heard\_.  On the contrary, I feel an obligation to \_actively prevent\_ the harm you would be inflicting on society at large and others individually by supporting the propagation of ideology that is harmful.

To that end, I feel obligated to take my support away from institutions that promote harmful speech being heard.  Right now that's Musk's Twitter.

My reasoning is both the fact that it's possible for our future generations to see different faces, and ideas within our government, while Thomas Jefferson himself said laws much change every 20 years.. (He actually said 19, so I suppose 19 years could be the term limit, sounds silly though..)

"Fentanyl and Un-documented immigrants
If one watches the media, one is bombarded by two facts falsely combined into one.  

* Upwards of two million immigrants flowed into the USA via our border with Mexico in the past year.
* Last year more than 11,000 pounds of fentanyl made its way into the U.S. 

Fox News would have its viewers thinking that the two million immigrants were the means of transport for the 11,000 pounds of fentanyl.    


If we stop the un-documented from entering, we stop the fentanyl, or do we?  

One pound of fentanyl has a street value of  about $45,000.  

As a business, would the cartel bosses trust a poor South or Central American with more than a half million dollars of product, with the knowledge that the ""mule"" would be poor, not speaking English, unarmed, and possibly wading across a river to enter the USA?  

Of course not which is why the majority of fentanyl is carried by US citizens across common points of entry into the USA - not by undocumented immigrants trying to avoid border agents as they cross the desert and rivers.",0

"The Problem with Candace Cameron Bure We Seem to Ignore
 

I don't think it's news to anyone that Candace Cameron Bure has a problematic past, but I think something about her new network has made me even more aware of the toxicity she brings to the table. I am referring to her promotion of whiteness. What is whiteness? I am drawing on multiple definitions, but for this post, I will define whiteness as,



>""The structures that produce promote and solidify white identities, spaces, values, institutions, narratives into the American landscape. These structures exist and replicate due to inherent systemic racism and white privilege.""

(I want to mention that I am a straight, white, cisgender male, so I am no authority on what people of color experience. This opinion piece is just my particular grievance based on my perceptions of the problematic nature of whiteness. )

Bure has expressed her desire to promote a Christian message in Christmas movies. When she became the Chief Creative Officer of the television network *Great American Family (GAC),* Bure was adamant about not including LGBTQIA families on *GAC.* Her most recent film, A Christmas Present, aired in November, and the promotion on Bure's Instagram for the project leaves much to be desired. 

Bure's film seems to feature an all-white cast promoting Christianity on a network called *Great American Family.* The message it presents might have been commonplace in 1950s America but is incompatible with the vast spectrum of American families that exist in America today. The film promotes a vision of America rooted in whiteness. 

It would be one thing if Bure featured families of color in conjunction with a Christian message, but from what it appears, that is not the route she took. It seems highly unlikely that Bure could not find people of color who would participate in the film. I am unwilling to say that Bure is racist, I don't think she is, but she is complicit in the enduring problem of whiteness in American pop culture. 

Unfortunately for Bure, whether or not she was aware of the problematic history of whiteness and Christianity, she has allowed it to continue. Christianity is at the heart of this form of whiteness, which turns a blind eye to colonization and promotes a vision of a homogenous, white, heteronormative, gender-binary America.",0

"Walter Reuther, a giant of 20th century liberalism
Walter Reuther (1907-1970), labor union organizer and civil rights activist, served as President of the United Automobile Workers from 1946 to 1970. Born to Wheeling, West Virginia to socialist German immigrant parents, Reuther was raised around leftist and labor union organizing, as well as being taught opposition to racism. As a child, he and his father visited Socialist Party Presidential candidate Eugene Debs while Debs was in prison for giving a speech against WW1.

In 1927 at the age of 19 Reuther moved to Detroit and found employment at the Ford Motor Company, though he was fired in 1932 for socialist organizing. While he worked at Ford, his high skill as a mechanic allowed him to be sent do work on behalf on the company in the Soviet Union, and during his 3 year world tour he had travel through much of Europe, as well as Turkey, Iran, India, China, and Japan.

Reuther became associated with the young United Automobile Workers, becoming President of the Local 174 in west Detroit. In 1936 he led the union workers in a successful strike against the Kelsey Hayes, who supplied brake drums and wheels to Ford. Upon Reuther's insistence, women won equal pay for equal work. The speed-up of the assembly line was slowed down and the company could not fire a worker for joining the union. UAW Local 174's membership expanded from 200 before the strike to 35,000 within the next year. Over the years he was involved in organizing a number of important strikes and helped to win many gains for workers.

Though he had been a long time Socialist Party member, Reuther joined the Democratic Party in the 1930s and became a strong supporter of FDR. In 1940, Reuther responded to WW2 by promoting the idea of auto manufacturing plants converting to the production of weapons, which was later done after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. He personally met Roosevelt in the White House to discuss the plan. Roosevelt would come to refer to Reuther as his ""red headed engineer"". He would later meet with Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson. After the war Reuther was elected President of the United Automobile Workers. He was also President of the Congress of Industrial Organizations between 1952 and 1955, and was involved with its merger with the AFL to form the AFL-CIO.

Reuther worked to integrate black workers into the labor unions and fought against segregation. Under his leadership the UAW won many concessions from the auto companies and gains for the workers. Reuther had become a strong anti communist, and had the communists expelled from the labor movement. Despite this, he was viewed with suspicious by many on the right, being called the ""most dangerous man in America"" by some Republicans, and was called the ""most dangerous man in Detroit"" by Governor George Romney. Survived several assassination attempts, such as in 1948 when he was shot through his kitchen window in the arm and back by a shotgun. A year later his brother also survived an assassination attempt by a man with a shotgun. The man was never caught, and FBI director Hoover expressed a complete lack of interest in investigation.

Reuther was also a strong supporter of and an activist in the Civil Rights Movement. He knew and worked with MLK, and marched with Dr. King in Selma, Birmingham, Montgomery, and Jackson. Reuther raised $160,000 for the release of protesters, and the UAW raised $75,000 for the NAACP for the Brown v. Board of Education case with the Supreme Court, as well as raised money for several other civil rights efforts. He helped to finance and organize the March on Washington, and spoke there. He was on the board of directors for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). He sent letters to Johnson, who he was a major supporter of, even during the Vietnam War, urging greater civil rights measures. Reuther also lent his support and aid to Cesar Chavez and the United Farm Workers in California.

On May 9, 1970, Reuther and his wife died in a plane crash. At his funeral there were 3,400 people in attendance. Dr. King's wife, Coretta King, was one of the speakers. His name lives on in several awards and memorials.        https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Reuther",0

"Explain the reasoning for wanting to reduce oil production in the USA for climate change.
I am not sure if I am just completely clueless but those who are liberals/democrats help me to understand this point. I might just be plain wrong and would like to be educated.

If the USA wanted to become a ‚Äúgreener‚Äù nation, why would we produce oil anywhere else but domestically? 

It seems like, since Biden shut down new fracking, we are buying more oil from Russia. In my head I am thinking that: 

1. Russia does not have as strict regulations for fracking/transporting oil compared to the USA. (No EPA)

2. It has to be transported a farther distance thus increasing risk for spills.

3. And Russia does not seem to have as many regulations regarding the disposal/cleanup of oil.

So in a nutshell; would it not be ‚Äúbetter for the environment‚Äù to produce oil here domestically? Versus buying it from Russia who produces it in a far less green way? 

Please no hate. I am genuinely trying to understand the reasoning for climate activists wanting to reduce oil production here but support production overseas where it is arguably worse environmentally.",0

He invited and encouraged a group of incoherent bellicose rejects to attack a co-equal branch of government.

"Biden ushering an historically great showing in the midterms. Now what?
When the day began I was giddy because I'm a political junkie but fully expecting to see a republican victory - certainly in the House and perhaps in the Senate. Part of this is surely my inherent pessimism which comes from being a liberal, part of this is based in historical trends in Democrats underperforming polls in the last few election cycles and in the past few decades of the party with the presidency getting shellacked in the midterms (2014 Ds -14, 2010 D's - 63, 2006 R's - 30), and mostly because the fundamentals - namely inflation - created such a strong headwind for the Democratic party.

As it stands shortly after midnight EST, we are seeing an amazing result! Democrats are dramatically outperforming even the most optimistic democratic scenarios and the mood on Fox News is hilariously somber.

What are the takeaways from this great night so far and how will you be engaging with your family, friends, colleagues and fellow citizen tomorrow and in the coming days and weeks? We will need to combat election fraud doubts which we are already seeing from the MAGA crowd and we need to be able to frame how amazing of a night this was for Democrats so we can capitalize on this momentum headed towards '24.",0

"An Argument Against Deontological Libertarianism
Deontology is based upon rights to things that come from self-ownership. Self-ownership can be shown to not be objective and universal. Labor that transforms the Earth does not generate a property right. It is possible to know that enforcing property will encourage investment and that a person will become less happy if something is taken from them. However, a right can not be known from that fact.

There can be a utilitarian justification for rules that increase investment. Labor is any transformation of the world used to change the future. All labor is not the same, and nothing moral can be deduced from labor. An example would be the labor of a soldier. This labor seems amoral to Libertarians.  The motivation for all conversations about rights is always some economic good.

Whenever someone says that their rights or freedom were violated it means their happiness was reduced. All examples of happiness being reduced can be understood with economics, psychology, and neuroscience. Those fields are completely amoral and descriptive without the concept of freedom. A useful concept here is the utility function.

Most Libertarian texts do not argue for natural rights in themselves but connect rights with something humans usually are concerned with. Two good examples would be Man, Economy, and State by Rothbard and Anthem by Ayn Rand. The book by Rothbard argues that Libertarian policies would raise living standards which shows there is a confusion and that what is actually important to the reader and author is economic growth/living standards. The book Anthem connected the idea of freedom with a story of a socially isolated person that invents the lightbulb. The book is actually about social isolation, and about technological progress. Living standards, social isolation, and technological progress are all things that effect an economic agent's utility function. The utility function is actually what is important to economic agents rather than rights.

It is true that certain events such as death or violence have a large negative effect on any persons happiness. Since a lot of utility is lost many conclude that a right was violated. It would be false to conclude that because any example of something that seems to be a rights violation can be generalized as a particularly low part of a utility function. Under utilitarianism, death would certainly be a thing that must be minimized as much as possible because of its large negative effect on the overall happiness of everyone.

For people to own their bodies their mind must be separated from their body. This is not the case, and people actually are their bodies. If the universe thought we ought to always possess our bodies human beings would never die. What can be proved by our experience of our bodies is that Homo Sapiens evolved on the planet Earth. Nothing moral can be proved from that fact. There is no special and necessary relationship between me and my body. A persons body is a collection of cells rather than a single moral object. If controlling someone's finger while they were asleep were necessary to push a button that prevented the end of the world than it might be very wrong to never violate self-ownership.",0

"Don't Give Them What They Want
I know we don't trust polls anymore but all this ""the Dems are doing great"" talk isn't helpful either. I looked at the polls for the first time and most say we don't have a chance. History says the same thing.   Are we setting ourselves up for giant heartbreak?

I can also already see the MSM headlines on Wednesday morning: Voter's failed/ Voter's have given their stamp of approval on Jan 6./ Voter's want women stuck in the 1950's/ White women hate people of color and are the devil/ Liberals don't care about the environment or democracy...

Even though they all know what the map looks like. The truth is there are many more GOP safe seats up for election this cycle than Dem. There are a ton of GOP uncontested races scattered throughout the country. History says the GOP takes power this cycle. A year ago all we heard was how likely it was for the GOP to take power due to the map.

Can it change? Sure.  Does that guarantee the GOP win? No.  But we all believed Trump couldn't win  -even though history said he would. Simply because he had an R next to his name.  I don't believe young voters have been given enough attention. And I believe they're going to be missing this cycle.

A lot of us are EXHAUSTED. We have worked hard. Participated. Donated. Voted. Volunteered. Won by historical numbers.   And yet we lost Roe. We have violence at the Capitol and dead children in our schools. We can't afford anything. We are using more oil than ever.  Voting rights are being taken away.  WW3 is knocking at our doorstep.

All of this should encourage us to work HARDER. But that's not always how humans work. We're exhausted. And we feel like the system is stacked against us. No matter what we do. And that even if we win, we still lose. We've all become disenfranchised to some extent. (Which is THE GOAL BTW)

I'm on a tangent now.  But the main point is don't let the MSM divide us further.   If we lose the midterms it's because the deck was stacked against us to begin with. And the GOP/Internet/Fox has propagandized their voters for years now. We literally live in two different realities. We get completely different news everyday. They're going to vote for the candidate with an R next to their name. Even when it's against their own interest.

Don't blame your teammates if we lose the midterms. ( I'm not speaking of the party itself, just the voters ). Don't let the MSM get away with blaming them either. Those who think like you, or similar enough to you, are not the problem.  It's going to suck enough. If we keep dividing ourselves, we will continue to lose our freedoms, progress and hope.

Hopefully, we win and my message isn't needed. Just throwing it out there because I'm already seeing signs of blame on MSM.",0

No one seem to be talking about that in today climate, I am sure this used to be a republican talking point that they used to run on, but I have not seen anyone used it for their campaign, at the very least I haven't heard anyone utter the word 'Family Values'.

"Help me understand
I live in a blue state in the midwest.  I don‚Äôt feel good saying this but it‚Äôs been on my mind recently.

Why do our taxes consistently pay for disaster relief in states like Louisiana, Florida, Texas?  All red, white trash states that fly the Confederate flag over the Stars and Stripes and don‚Äôt want to be part of the country until they need money?  There‚Äôs a lot of crumbling bridges in PA, OH, MI, MN that could use that money.

Why do we keep rebuilding areas that will be destroyed again by the next hurricane caused by global warming that these Neanderthals don‚Äôt believe in anyway?  FL‚Äôs governor spends 12M on a political stunt, and will probably be re-elected, and we blue states that fund the bulk of the tax base hand him billions to rebuild.

I don‚Äôt feel good saying that because we are all Americans, whether they acknowledge it or not.  But I am starting to see these red state idiots as a burden on the rest of us.  Rubio has his hand out for FL but voted against aid when blue states needed it.

What‚Äôs it going to take for the red states to step up, pull their share and start being Americans?",0

"If there was a way to extract and bring to term the child outside of the womb, would that change your opinion?
To be clear I think that the thing in the womb is alive, is maybe a baby, but is not a person because personhood is a legal fiction (a legal fiction that I appreciate). 

I think that we are killing something that is alive, which is bad, but the alternative, which is to inhibit the autonomy of a person to control their body is worse, so I choose bad over worse. 

If the thing in the womb could be removed, without killing it, without some intrusive surgery, so some kind of magic or technical future, and was perfectly safe (100% success rate), was free, took no time, and didn‚Äôt require the parent to go anywhere or do anything, would you still think it‚Äôs okay to conduct an abortion in the way we currently do it?

I know I‚Äôve concocted some utopic future, but I like to challenge myself with these kinds of questions and I don‚Äôt have an answer because now I‚Äôm plagued with: whose responsibility is the child? I can‚Äôt force child rearing onto someone who didn‚Äôt follow through with a birth, so now I feel like I‚Äôm killing a baby to avoid inconveniencing someone‚Ä¶ smart people help me with this dilemma please.",0

"2018 Trump may have made thing much worse for 2022 Trump!!
Oddly enough, one of the¬†multiple laws covering the mishandling of government information¬†is one that Trump himself amended during his tenure in the Oval Office, as pointed out¬†by Tennessee state Sen. Jeff Yarbro¬†(D) on Twitter.

Tucked into¬†a bill Trump signed¬†into law in January 2018 was a provision increasing the punishment for knowingly removing classified materials with the intent to retain them at an ‚Äúunauthorized location.‚Äù

Previously, someone found guilty of this crime could face up to one year in prison. When former CIA Director David Petraeus was charged in 2015 with¬†mishandling classified data, he pleaded guilty under this statute¬†to avoid a felony charge, as¬†Politico pointed out. A similar situation unfolded a decade earlier, when former national security adviser Samuel Berger¬†pleaded guilty¬†to removing terrorism-related materials from the National Archives in 2005.

Now, a person convicted of violating this law can face up to five years in prison ‚Äï making it a felony-level offense to mishandle classified documents under 18 U.S.C. 1924.",0

"Anyone else think the PPP loan forgiveness pile on is a poor argument?
Let me preface by saying I support student loan forgiveness, but only in the targeted manner the administration has proposed.

What I find disingenuous is the conflation of forgiven PPP loans as a way to point out conservative hypocrisy. On its face, it just another form about whataboutism, but it‚Äôs also not a fair comparison. 

Setting aside the the cases of fraud for a second, the relief was set up so that only the amount that business owners used towards paying their employees was forgiven. The remaining loan amount acts as a normal loan at 3% interest ie it was just a roundabout way to keep worker‚Äôs paychecks coming in. It is not a direct benefit to the employer.

This is not at all the same as a student loan borrower who directly benefits from student loan relief.

I know I may get thrashed on here, but my intent is only to strengthen the progressive argument, and not to take lazy shortcuts.

Instead, I think the better argument is recognizing the demographic shift from Boomers being the dominant demographic with political power, to now the Millennials, and this is just their way of getting their fair share, and in doing so growing a robust middle class.",0

I would consider myself patriotic but in a way where I can see the good in our country but also want to see it made better.  Because of the environment lately, it seems like the flag has been co-opted by the extreme right as a way of showing how perfect America is.

Opinion | Which Republican Senate candidate is worst? There are so many choices!,0
"While it is very concerning, we need to stop looking at these low turnout primary votes as proving things like Trump is all powerful or Kansas is pro choice. When only the zealots vote this is what you get.
We need to get people to the polls in November.   We are seeing what happens when only the zealots vote.   

I am watching NBC and their point is that the results show the Republican party is Trump's party.  but I am not so sure.   Trump is the person of choice for the people who were willing to vote, but most weren't. 

While I admit I didn't look at ever state, in many states turnout was very low.    

As an example in my very blue state of MD we had a republican governor for the last 8 years.   He showed that a moderate Republican could win here.  He backed the moderate candidate who lost to the Trump backed candidate.   But when you look at the polling numbers, the governor won with 1.2 million votes in 2018 (in an non presidential election year.)  This year's nominee got about 150,000 votes or roughly 12% of the votes the governor got in the general election.  So when you have that few people voting the really motivated are ""over represented"".   Who voted in the Republican primary?  People still wearing MAGA hats, flying Trump flags. They, older people and retirees are going to be very over represented.

Now this isn't just on the Republican side.  In Kansas, a ruby red state, access to abortion won by a wide margin.  You can't convince me that in Kansas people are pro choice by a large margin.   But again, this got a specific group very motivated and to the polls so it won handily.

Now I have to say if people don't bother to vote in November, they will win again, we have to have people turn out. 

And I just have to add an opinion. Do we now see why the minority wants to make voting more difficult?",0

"Why do conservatives seem to get even more angry when they've gotten something they wanted?
I understand that modern conservatives run on anger. But it's confusing to me how the politicians and media that support it keep this going.

How is it that even as they get everything they ask for they just get more and more angry?

For example during the trump years when they got their openly hateful president, and he did the massive tax cuts for the wealthy they wanted, they seemed even angrier about the US being ""too woke"" and taxes being ""too high"". He passed a Muslim ban (yeah I know he claimed it wasn't) and got away with it and they still raged more about Muslims.

They got away with stealing a supreme court seat and stacking the supreme court. They still raged even more than the system is skewed against them.

When Roe v Wade was ended they seemed to start raging even more about abortion.

I know anger is the main tool their people in power use on them. But how is it they manage to make them even MORE angry when they get what they want AND when something that goes against it happens?

This isn't a universal trend with all political affiliations. For example, BLM protests when a cop kills someone unjustly, but later if that cop is actually sentenced for it they notably are glad for it. You see comments that might say ""It's a little bit of justice but it's just a start"" but they don't get MORE angry.

Environmentalist groups protest when a new mountain top removal project is approved, or something like that, but when a new protection is passed they still praise the victory. Likewise they do note having more work to do, but they don't become MORE angry.

What is going on with these conservatives that they just always seem to be seething with rage, and even when they get what they said they wanted they seem to become more enraged?",0

"The Supreme court has become immoral
Every individual has their own code of morality whether they belong to a religious or not. This is the same for societies and religions. When that  code becomes dogma, when it does not allow for adaptation to better itself then that code becomes immoral. The entire premise that the constitution must be interpreted as the founding 'fathers' envisioned it is immoral. Fundamentalist by this definition are immoral and that is what the Catholic Church, the Evangelicals, the Federalists Society have become. When a species cannot adapt, cannot advance, it dies; it becomes extinct. There is always flux in an environment or society. Humans as a whole once only hunted and foraged and they migrated to follow their food source. Then they started growing foods that they manipulated to serve them better, settling the people in one place. Now most live in cities with a small number growing food and the vast majority specialize in widely variable occupations. Those different situations demand different social rules or codes of behavior. To force a code for a nomadic people or an agrarian society on those in an urban society is not adaptable or sane. There is a reason we feel as if we are living in an age of insanity. 

Our current Supreme Court is working to force religious and political dogma on a country which does not benefits from either of those. In fact it is doing great harm. If we do not fix this problem our society, our democracy, our country may not survive.",0

"Soft-on-crime policies sting federal bench after violent criminal kills woman upon release  Last week, 31-year-old Christy Bautista of Harrisonburg, Va., was [killed at the Ivy City Hotel](https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/virginia-woman-killed-in-stabbing-inside-hotel-room-in-northeast-dc/3321310/) in Washington, D.C., where she was staying to attend a concert. Bautista, a [2018 graduate from James Madison University](https://www.breezejmu.org/news/jmu-alumna-christy-bautista-found-dead-after-stabbing-in-d-c-hotel-room/article_ca86fd7e-d248-11ed-aa59-e77155d1c4d7.html), was stabbed 30 times less than an hour after she checked in. 

 In October, Sydnor was charged with armed robbery, which was reduced to  an attempted robbery charge to which he pleaded guilty. He has a  criminal history going back to 2000, as he was previously convicted of  several felonies and misdemeanors such as rape, domestic violence, and  armed robbery, according to media reports and court records. 

 Following his October arrest, a [judge denied Sydnor bail](https://freebeacon.com/latest-news/biden-judge-released-man-accused-of-d-c-hotel-murder-from-jail-in-december/)  because of his criminal history. However, D.C. Superior Court Judge  Sean Staples, a Biden appointee, later took over Sydnor's case and  released him from jail in January, [according to court documents](https://eaccess.dccourts.gov/eaccess/search.page.3.1?x=I9QOj7oFwKRL9sz7W3Tvcxxxg5m7PDmauwblmf2c9Xmjma8BG*f-2TNP4a*0RniPeSn2KJSRh*YiVnvhPmQieQ).

"Non-MAGA Conservative Defense of Trump What is very troubling to me is the way that the media seems to think that any conservative defense of Donald Trump is simply blind MAGA loyalty. Trump is not my preferred candidate in 2024, I‚Äôm not his biggest fan and I am by no means MAGA. But at the same time, I don‚Äôt have to be a hardcore trump supporter to see that what Bragg is going is not only legally flimsy, but extremely problematic for the precedent it sets. There are legitimate weaknesses in Bragg‚Äôs case and a clear political motive to proceed ahead on these charges. 

But the media wants to make every defense of Trump into more evidence that all conservatives are only supporting him out of fear or blind loyalty. That couldn‚Äôt be farther from the truth and it‚Äôs a distortion in order to distract from the many flaws in what Bragg is doing. If a prosecution and indictment are not based on sound legal theories it is incumbent upon us to point these things out, regardless of the target. Or, in this case, especially because the target here is a former President. 

I‚Äôm not against what Bragg is doing because I am a MAGA believer, but because his chosen course of action is simply too fraught with bias and weak legal theories.",2

"Come here looking for advice on gun ownership (never owned one before) I'll be honest, I'm a liberal guy who has never owned a firearm before. But as a father of three, I am increasingly anxious about the lack of ability to protect my family in the event of a home invasion (sort of like what happened in Cheshire CT a few years back). I have a lot of questions so was hoping y'all could help me. I live in Massachusetts so I am expecting a lot of paperwork involving the licensing. My goal is to just have some kind of handgun that could safely be locked away in my master bedroom closet that would be there if needed. I spoke with my partner about this expecting her to be against the idea and surprisingly she was on board with it. I assume she has the same fears that I do. 

1) How much should I expect to spend on this? I would assume that I would need a gun safe of some sort that would have a keypad that only I know the code to. 

2) Are there any recommendations for what type of handgun I should get? 

3) Is there ongoing maintenance that would be required? Or can it sit for years without being touched presuming I never have to use it?

EDIT: you have all been very helpful and I appreciate that. I think the one major factor that I need to keep in mind is if I pull the trigger on this, no pun intended, it‚Äôs going to involve periodically going to the range and practicing. There is a local gun club up the road from me so i think i will go there.",2
