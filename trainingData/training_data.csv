"How do you think the prosecution of Trump might affect the 2024 election?
Today I was listening to an NPR interview with a NYT columnist and a Bulwark columnist who were both arguing that that case against Trump is weak. It made me recall the midterms... Remember how Democrats contributed to the campaigns of MAGA Republicans because that would be an easier general election challenge to defeat? That ended up paying off as MAGA messaging continues to be a losing strategy. Perhaps the prosecution of Trump will have a similar effect on the 2024 election. The GOP will have to rally behind Trump during the proceedings lest they be chastised by the base, stifling any possibility of competition to Trump in the primaries. Biden has already beat Trump before, so even if Trump can wiggle out of this one and makes it to the general election...better the devil you know...

Yet, that behavior has been tolerated?

"How are my fellow US mothers coping?
Hi reddit I am in dire need of a good venting and maybe some stories or discussions on how you all are managing during these trying times. Anyway this morning my 8 year old son was misbehaving before school (running around the yard not getting into the car....tried throwing his book bag in our pool etc) anyway I yelled at him little louder and more than I think I should have. It wasn't too bad and I know he is okay. But I feel guilty. What if God forbid there is another shooting and it's him today? I am in tears thinking of other mothers who may have had a bad morning and never got to say sorry. Almost daily I worry when I drop my kids off if I'm making a mistake leaving them there. It's even starting to worry me going to the store. Nowhere is safe. Nowhere. I lost my mother at a very young age and my father when I was 20. Sisters when I was too young to remember them. So all the loss I  have suffered im sure is adding to my worry but I just find myself being afraid to take my kids anywhere but home. Is anyone else feeling this way sometimes? How do you cope with it? What can any of us do to feel or be safer? I do not like guns but my SO has a pistol for protection we usually leave at home but I don't think a gun is going to save us from a gun you know. What can we do?

"Why Republicans Are Doomed
I believe that the Republican Party, as we know it, will be hollowed out. It will be a slow process that will play out over the next generation or two, and we have already seen it begin. Last year's midterms were one of the weakest performances by an opposing party in recent history. What is especially remarkable is that this occurred while the president's approval rating was underwater. 

College-educated are leaving the Republican party. In 2000, 23% of Democrats had a college degree. Today, it is 48%. For Republicans, it is virtually unchanged from 30% to 31%. Imagine a time when Republicans were the educated party! College-educated voters are reliable voters. These are the people that will get out and vote during midterms.

Religion is declining in America, which is true in both parties. There will come a point in time when the Republican party will go to war with itself. It might be soon. Less than 2 in 3 Republicans consider religion to be important in their lives. The religious right considers their religion to be the core of their belief system. It gives them their moral justification to commit hateful acts against vulnerable groups of people. If the declining trend in religious affiliation continues, the religious right will find itself to be a minority within its own party.

The generational divide is beginning to grow. Millennials are not growing more conservative as they age. This trend is likely to continue in succeeding generations. Over half of millennials identify as Democrat or lean Democrat, but only about 1 in 3 millennials identify as Republican or lean Republican. People are better educated and are better able to reject conservative principles which cause harm to minorities and other vulnerable groups.

In time, the Republican party will probably eventually recover, but not before the very identity of the party has been stripped bare and exposed for the country to see. A reckoning is coming for the Republican party, and it will not be pretty. So sit back, grab some popcorn, and enjoy the show.",0

"What do liberals think of China and US-China relations?
As a liberal Democrat, I have mixed feelings about China. My gut reaction to seeing Republican leaders badmouth China is to think we shouldn't do that and we should aim to make US-China relations as good as possible, especially relations with their (now effectively dictator or President with no term limits) leader Xi Jinping. On the other hand, maybe some of the bad things Republican leaders say about China has some merit. Like maybe China really is a dictatorship with an overpowered, top-down authoritarian government. China has vastly more public video cameras than any other country on Earth and those video cameras are hooked into a centralized Artificial Intelligence system that captures, stores, and identifies all the faces it sees (see [Mass Surveillance In China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_surveillance_in_China)). Like the authorities in China can take a photo of anyone's face (or pull a photo from one of the cameras), upload it, and it will show when and where in the country that face was seen and it will be able to look up that person's identity, for example from ID photos, mugshots, and everywhere on the internet where photos of that person exist. They claim this system is to deter crime, but it's a little discomforting. There have been reports of them placing these cameras observing the entrances of homes of people who disagree with the government. I even read a story about the Chinese government trying to use brain scans hooked into AI to check for loyalty to the government. On the other side, after 9/11 the US set up surveillance systems on ordinary Americans like the recording of all phone calls, so it's not like the US is spotless when it comes to surveillance of its citizens. If the US really wants information on someone it can request that information from private companies like Google, Apple, Facebook, AT&T, etc. I heard that in China there isn't the division between private corporations and the government that exists in the US, but it's not like the US doesn't get info on private citizens from corporations in cases of things like actual or suspected crimes, terrorism, etc.


Then there's China denying that Taiwan is a separate country with its own democratic government (they split in the past after a war) and possibly invading Taiwan, sparking a military conflict. Then there's the persecution and mistreatment of Muslim Uighurs. On the other hand, during WW2 the American government effectively put all the Japanese in prison (""internment camps"") and obviously the US has a history of slavery, plus remember all the Muslim civilians who were killed in the US's wars in the Middle East, so it's not like we the US is unequivocally morally superior to China.

One thing that concerns me is the Chinese internet is closed off to public US websites like Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, Instagram, the New York Times, etc. Like the Chinese people don't have access to the outside internet, so the Chinese government can set the narrative and there is no visible counter-narrative. This is what's happening in Russia, with support for Putin still strong as they don't know the truth about the war in Ukraine.

On the other hand, even though China is a dictatorship, it is a left-wing, supposedly pro-proletariat ""people's dictatorship"", so maybe they have some stuff in common with the left wing in the US? I honestly don't know if China is neutral, friend, or foe.

One more thing. I don't know if there are some advantages that such a centralized, top-down system has over a spread-out, more bottom-up, more democratic system. Like maybe China has the capacity to out-pace the US in certain forms of research because Xi Jinping can just allocate resources and people-power to specific things without having to go through the democratic process. I don't know.

"LEGAL Gun Ownership /Weapon Ownership should not be a Left vs Right Issue at all, the left needs to utilize the second amendment
 It is perfectly fine and reasonable to use a weapon to defend yourself in your home from criminals. People always say ""just call the police"" but what do you think the police have? The police will go into an apartment with 30 well-built men, all of them holding guns, body armor, and whatever to protect their lives. The police don't tell the guys to come out and ""fight like a man"" they shoot on sight. The government has no duty to protect you

[https://ehlinelaw.com/blog/do-police-have-a-duty-to-protect-me#:\~:text=True%2C%20Unless%20police%20have%20assumed,occur%2C%E2%80%9D%20said%20Darren%20L](https://ehlinelaw.com/blog/do-police-have-a-duty-to-protect-me#:~:text=True%2C%20Unless%20police%20have%20assumed,occur%2C%E2%80%9D%20said%20Darren%20L)

"" True, **Unless police have assumed a duty to protect you, they don't have one**. ‚ÄúNeither the Constitution nor state law, impose a general duty upon police officers or other government officials to protect individual persons from harm ‚Äî even when they know the harm will occur,‚Äù said Darren L. ""

Does anyone remember the Uvalde massacre? The police stood outside while kids were getting murdered because they were outgunned by one individual. Most of the time the police are not prepared to deal with heavily armed individuals. So if a criminal decided to fuck with you in your home and you don't have a gun, HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO PROTECT YOURSELF WHEN THE PEOPLE YOUR TAX DOLLARS GO TO, PROBABLY CAN'T EVEN PROTECT YOU.

You must take responsibility for the defense of your own life. Now does this mean I don't think there should be any gun laws? No. That would be ridiculous. I want background checks for guns. I want the training required to properly use a gun. Most importantly, I want people to treat guns as a last resort and an extension of their own homes.

**WHEN YOU ARE IN PUBLIC YOU SHOULD RETREAT. WHEN YOU ARE IN YOUR OWN HOME YOU CAN USE WHATEVER WEAPON NECESSARY TO CAUSE THE THREAT TO RETREAT, OR ATTACK THE THREAT IF HE COMES AFTER YOU.**

Seriously, start the legal paper work to get a gun as soon as possible. You can also check your state laws to see if you can carry around pepper spray. Pepper spray is far less lethal and a great defense for anyone who doesn't want to get into fisticuffs with strangers on the street. Men, women, non-binary, it doesn't matter who you are. There is no ""honor"" in this society. Get something to even the odds. There is no ""fight like a man"" for all the men out there, and you can't avoid every conflict through de-escalation, submission, or just talking someone down.

The government literally can't protect everyone. If you can't remember the guy's face, there is nothing the police can do. If there are no witnesses or cameras, nothing the police can do. If the police don't care, you will be screwed.

The democrats you vote for have armed security. Whenever the NRA protests or conservatives protest the police do not try to instigate with them. The police let them protest in peace or try to side with them. The well-regulated militia that the second amendment is supposed to provide has been high jacked by the republican party. They are brainwashed by fox news. At the end of the day they will follow orders and use their guns to make you submit.

"Debate Me (I'm bored üò≠)
Hello, I'm Aaron, a 16 y/o moderate conservative. I've not been into politics very long but I like to debate people with different views.

Personally I believe there is right and wrong in both sides of the political spectrum equally. Some basic things I support are things like racial equality, same-sex marriages, and improvements to education and social security networks. On the other hand, I believe the second amendment shouldn't be repealed and things like illegal immigration should be looked at more seriously. I believe in complete freedom of religion and speech but I believe no politician should act with religious bias, just as I believe no teacher should act with political bias. I am pro-choice until a few weeks into pregnancy once the embryo begins to properly develope, which then I turn pro-life. The most controversial opinion I have would probably be that I am against trans peoples, as the entire concept doesn't make sense in my eyes. Economically I lean further right than in most things. I believe federal spending should be cut down (See the United States massive debt issue) and in lowering taxes (Or at the very least, putting that money into something useful).

The biggest issue I believe in politics is the massive hypocrisies both sides make, and just how much hatred there is in the system. A compromise is not a bad thing, no matter how hard radicals try to make it seem. 

Well, my thumbs are getting tired, if you disagree anywhere or if I was too vague (I probably was), lemme know what you think and I'll give you my POV.

Marianne Williamson is likely to seek the Democratic nomination in 2024. Challenging Joe Biden,0
"I'm really worried that Biden may loose to DeSantis in 2024. Wanted to know other Liberal's thoughts.
I wanted to ask for people's opinion here on something that I am increasingly worried about.

I really like Biden, voted for him in the primary and general, and his approval rating shouldn't be this low considering how well he has led this country through the mess that it has been in since COVID. I'd be just fine with him serving a second term.

But what's most important to me now is that whoever wins in 2024 is a Democrat, not a Republican. If DeSantis wins, with Roe gone, he could pass executive orders to, say, ban millitary healthcare from providing reproductive care, or things like that, all without worrying about a filibuster.

Biden could easily defeat Trump, but DeSantis is a lot smarter, which makes him even worse. In the general, he would probably portray himself as ""a new generation of leadership for the future"" or some nonsense like that. I'm worried that the contrast alone between 82-year old Biden and 40-something DeSantis could prove to be devastating. If the economy hasn't caught up yet it could be even worse. Most voters wouldn't care.

It seems Biden is planning on running again, relying on the same playbook as he did in 2020. So nobody else is challenging him. But this isn't 2020. My best hope, if DeSantis wins the nomination, is that he and Trump tear each other apart and he is forced to go so far to the right on issues that it poisons his chance to win the election.

I'd like to ask for other people's opinion on this. Democrats don't seem to be talking about it much, especially after the midterms, but it is something that REALLY worries me. I like Biden, but I'd rather he end his career on a high note that end up loosing to some freedom-caucus anti-immigrant anti-LGBTQ anti-abortion culture warrior who is only popular because he charters flights from Texas to Massachusetts as some political stunt.

**TLDR**: I like Biden, but I REALLY don't wan't a Repub (like DeSantis) in 2024. I'm not sure Biden is the safest bet to prevent DeSantis or a non-Trump Repub from winning. That worries me. What are your thoughts? Do you agree or am I wrong?",0

"Old scheme to gut Social Security revisited.
 

Here they go again with a new conspiracy to undermine, if not completely kill Medicare and Social Security. Mike Pence recently gave a secretive speech in which he outlined the same scheme George Bush enunciated but was forced to abandon when the wheels fell off his proposal. 

It seems Pence is now conspiring with the likes of Steve Scalise, Rick Scott, Josh Hawley and a raft of Congressional Representatives who are owned by Wall Street to *disembowel the system.* 

The scheme is to allow future Social Security recipients to invest 2% of their money in the stock market. 2% doesn‚Äôt sound like much, but when considered over the broad expanse of Social Security system the withdrawal of that much money would certainly sink the program. 

Yes, at first blush it all seems good. And it would be if each future senior citizen was astute enough to hitch a ride on a rising market while bypassing a falling market; but what are the odds? One single major dip in the market could wipe out all gains in a heartbeat, and you would still have to pay fees on each purchase and sale to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. 

The brokerage houses don't give a damn if you win, or lose, you pay both ways! That‚Äôs why they are underwriting the plot with millions invested in the contrivance.¬† 

Ahh, but it doesn‚Äôt stop here. Last June, the Republican Study Committee, of which Scalise is a member, released a budget plan that included numerous suggested reforms for Medicare and Social Security, including raising the eligibility ages for each program to 67 and 70, respectively. The proposal further called for *withholding* *payments* for individuals who retire early or had a certain level of income, (your savings, investments and 401k) and also suggested using private funding sources to replace Medicare. 

‚ÄúPrivate funding sources‚Äù means private health insurance!. Private health insurance can be summed up in four words: ‚ÄúSorry, that‚Äôs a pre-existing condition.‚Äù 

As mentioned, Bush killed his plan because the market hit a downturn and lost over twenty-five percent and seniors gasped when they realized how much they would have lost from their benefits.

Yes, joy was discovered in the sins of vindictiveness and retaliation. 

All the ammunition needed for this pursuit has been provided to the Justice Department by the Select Committee and, as in hearing after hearing, they learned the names of the authors and the plan of sedition and heard it from Republicans themselves. 

For only the second time in history, some Americans turned against, and betrayed their country, and for this they will be harshly punished. 

There will be only fitful sleep for these traitors. They are now quaking with trepidation, fearing the moment when their names will be mentioned, and their crimes exposed. Fearing the condemning glance of their family members who will live in shame for generations, fearing the inevitable bankruptcy caused by predatory lawyers and the huge fines they face, and fearing being imprisoned with hardened criminals who will use them as sex toys.

"If you had cancer, got Covid, and died, it wasn't cancer that killed you.
&#x200B;

Have you ever wondered how life insurance companies make so much money? The simple answer is they don‚Äôt gamble, they use statistics to formulate their rates, statistics reflecting the actual number of deaths from any given disease (cancer, heart disease, diabetes, etc.) These statistics are reflected in charts called *actuarial tables* and they can predict with super accuracy how many people in the United States will die from any specific disease, in any given year. 

The US government uses these same types of charts to keep the CDC and other agencies up to date with a similar formula. 

There seems to be a contrarian streak in many people, a refusal to accept verifiable facts -- despite all the evidence ‚Äì and they remain resolute in their obduracy and firm in their unfounded convictions, 

Perhaps they think it makes them seem smart, well-informed and it gives them a sense of pleasure to stick their finger in the eye of conventional belief; *whatever.* 

A common example of this syndrome are right-wing claims that reported deaths from Covid are exaggerated, that many deaths caused by other diseases, even accidents, are attributed to Covid. Why they choose to believe this with no evidence to back it up, is beyond me; but again, *whatever.* 

To refute this silliness, I point to a government study in July of ‚Äò21 that clearly shows in the period between Feb. of ‚Äò20 and Jan. ‚Äò21 there were 100,000 deaths that couldn‚Äôt be attributed to anything other than Covid.

"Are Slander Lawsuits the Answer?
In the past, when politicians weren't so brazen in their lies about their political opponents, it was considered unseemly to pursue legal action for libel and slander against political opponents.  The courts provided a **lot** of latitude in political discourse that was tangential to the truth.  In those times, that made sense.  We don't live in those times.  


In these MAGA times, we see Trump accusing the Capitol Police Officer who shot Ashli Babbit of being a ""thug,"" ""misfit,"" and a ""coward"" and intimated that he was a murderer.  Marjorie Taylor Greene also asserted that Babbitt was murdered.

"Public money for public schools.
If one had to point to a single issue as to what made America great, it just might be our public school education system. It guarantees every child the opportunity to advance at one‚Äôs own level with no restriction on what one might achieve, providing they have the ability to maintain reasonable standards of productivity. 

Even though America‚Äôs most challenging period, Jim Crow, when black children were segregated and shunted aside to ‚ÄòSeparate, but equal‚Äô schools, (Which were separate, but not at all equal) a basic level of learning was realized. 

*Public* funding (tax dollars) provided the wherewithal to fund *public* *schools,* and although challenged by problems that beset any large institution it did achieve, according to the Census Bureau, a literacy rate of 86%, at near the top of all the nations of the world. 

But now a dual education proposal is challenging the public system all across America; the threat? Vouchers! 

The scheme is as simple as this. The proponents intend to siphon off tax dollars meant for public education and divert it to private academies and prep schools that cater to the well-to-do, and the wealthy. They hire public relations firms to concoct ridiculous stories about a grassroots movement supporting the plot, when in fact right-wing plutocrats fund the program in order to further the separations between the rich and the poor. 

Each day we read about heroic, *underpaid,* teachers and administrators reaching into their own pockets just to provide the basics, pencils, and paper, for their already underfunded schools. But now, with pristine arrogance, and even before those items can be procured, they want the public dollars to go to travel lacrosse teams and racing shells for their already privileged children. 

And to make matters worse, there is no accountability for those funds. Whereas public schools have to meet certain standards of learning, give tests, adhere to standards, and face sanctions if goals aren‚Äôt reached, no such rules apply to most voucher projects.

I'm a registered Democrat and generally have liberal views across the board, socially and economically.

That said, I became fascinated by disinformation in 2020 and sought out the ""least biased"" news. I landed on PBS NewsHour and, to a lesser extent, NPR as well. (Though, I may be biased to the digestibility that is NewsHour's tidy hour-long nightly newscast M-F, and an easy 30 minutes that is NewsHour Weekend on Sat and Sun.

I'll turn on Newsmax in order to know exactly what drek they're promoting. With the recent hubbub of DirecTV dropping Newsmax 1 year after they dropped OANN, I noticed the same talking points were being parroted over and over again, in particular by R congressmen, that DirecTV carries ""22 liberal channels"", which supposedly dwarfs the number of conservative networks.

I've attempted to find this list of 22 channels but have come up empty. It's true that the mainstream news channels skew slightly left-center, but I wouldn't call CBS, ABC, and NBC intrinsically ""liberal"".

"THE WHEELS OF JUSTICE...
These are long days and torturous nights for Paul Gosar and Kelli Ward, both of whom have shown support for the insurrectionists at the United States Capitol.¬† 

The Justice Department is deep into multiple investigations, investigations bolstered by evidence provided by the Jan. 6th Committee of the failed coup attempt, and they now possess a ‚Äòlandslide of evidence 'most of which comes from cell phones seized by the FBI.¬† 

They have recovered a treasure-trove of information from the phones of Giuliani, Eastman, Scott Perry, Mike Lindell, Boris Eashteyn, Victoria Toensing, (both Giuliani advisors) Michael McDonald, and Jeffrey Clarke, just to name a few. 

For a few brief moments this week, the sugar plums of sedition again danced in congressional heads when the courts issued a hold on Scott Perry‚Äôs phone. Ah, but the funny thing about telephones is they are two-way devices. 

In the heat of the insurrection phone calls, text messages, and emails flew about the government like newspapers on a New York City Street in a windstorm, but unlike the newspapers, these have been collected, collated. and compiled into binders related to specific schemes and to specific personages, to overthrow our democracy. 

Schemes like mounting a concerted effort to invalidate a legitimate vote, schemes like falsifying a slate of phony electors to change the vote, and most insidious of all, a scheme to replace a recalcitrant Attorney General with a stooge who would claim he sees irregularities in the election and will have the military seize the voting machines where, God knows, what would be done to them. 

Yes, there are heavy heads on pillows as the Justice Department completes its mission. Gosar and Ward aren‚Äôt the only ones sleeping a fitful sleep, they are joined by Mo Brooks, Louie Gohmert, Matt Gaetz, Andy Biggs, Josh Hawley, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Mark Meadows, Jim Jordan, Tom Cotton, Mike Lee, Lauren Boebert, Jim Banks, and others in their sweat-soaked tossing and turning.

G.O.P. State Lawmakers Push a Growing Wave of Anti-Transgender Bills,0
"[Hayek, Friedmann, Classic Liberal Theory] Are there valid reasons to subsidies Energycosts for consumers
Hey friends,

Context:

‚Ä¢ In Germany we have introduced subsidies to cap gas prices to 12ct per united for consumers. The difference between market price and the 12ct per unit is payed for by tax-money.

‚Ä¢ To incentivise conserving gas, this mechanism only works up to 80% (insentive: Safe 20%) of your gas-use in 2022. What is above that needs to be payed for by the consumer alone.

‚Ä¢ Providers are legally forced to explain any rise in their retail price on gas in 2023 in fine detail, so that they can't artificially rise them to get more subsidies.

‚Ä¢ There is no legal mechanism that forces providers to lower their prices.

In effect:

‚Ä¢ This lowers the effective gas-costs for consumers on their bill, which is good.

‚Ä¢ This uses up enourmous amounts of taxpayer money, which is reasonably bad.

‚Ä¢ This eradicates any incentive for customers to seek out a (slightly) cheaper gas providers, which is bad. (Reason: Doesn't matter to you, as you pay 12cents max per unit either way. And it's unlikely anyone can provide for lower)

‚Ä¢ It takes most incentives away from providers to lower their prices (because consumers don't really care), which is bad.

‚Ä¢ This encourages providers to keep their prices high (as this grants them more ‚Ç¨ per subsidised unit), which is bad.

The question:

‚Ä¢ When we look at classic liberal theory, can there be an argument for any sort of ""gas-price-break"" as it's called? Maybe a very low conservative cap at 50% of your former gas-use to uphold market pressures while also sustaining (more) buying power and general situation of the people?

‚Ä¢ What is the outlook for the economy if no subsidues are introduced? Lower prices but effectively more burden on consumers. Where are consumers supposed to get that money from? Bank loans or liquidating posessions? -> Is there a limit where the government should intervene before people fall into poverty (in classic liberal theory)?

‚Ä¢ Extra: Maybe any specific chapters I should read into?

Reforming the Judicial Branch

1. Expand SCOTUS to 13 members from the current 9. Instead of lifetime appointments, all justices will be restricted to fixed 18 year terms; once their term is up, they will be obligated to leave the bench. To reduce the currently extreme political implications of the SCOTUS nomination process (that are almost entirely caused by arbitrary circumstances such as death or retirement of a justice) all presidents will get the chance to nominate 2 justices, regardless of their political affiliation, in an effort to increase impartiality and fairness to the highest court in the land, which are characteristics that have been severely lacking in recent years. Lastly, all SCOTUS justices will be required to adhere to a Code of Ethics, since (amazingly) SCOTUS remains the only entity in the federal judiciary not to have one. As a side note, I believe the ethics issue is very relevant given the composition of today's court (Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito etc.)
2. Expand the size of the lower federal courts: As important as the Supreme Court is, very few cases will ever make it there. Most of this country's legal problems are still solved in the lower federal courts. Many people don't realize that the current size and composition of this subset of the judiciary hasn't been updated in more than 20 years. With the current judiciary still overwhelmingly represented by white, often conservative males, it's become painfully obvious it doesn't represent the increasing diversity that America has. In addition to these issues, lower federal courts have become backlogged by increasing numbers of cases, plaintiffs, and claimants over recent decades, meaning important sentences for criminals or defendants in civil cases have to wait months for their cases to be heard before a judge.

Reforming the Legislative Branch

1. Fixing the U.S. Senate: The issues of the Senate go beyond the legislative filibuster. What gets done in the Senate these days? Almost nothing, except judicial and federal cabinet nominations it seems. The dysfunction in the Senate is particularly acute due to egregious Republican malapportionment. Democratic Senators currently represent 43 million more Americans than Republican Senators. A state like Wyoming has over 60 times the voting power compared to California, even though both states share 2 Senators. The issue of the Senate is really overlooked I feel, even among many Democrats. How to change this? A simple solution: do away with the ""2 Senator state rule"" and replace it with a proportional system. All Senators will be allocated to States based on their populations. For example: a state like Vermont or Wyoming would only get 1 Senator, while a state like California would get 12 or 13. The effects of malapportionment can also be mitigated by admitting the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico as States to give them the representation they deserve. Lastly, Senators will be restricted to two six year terms.
2. Dramatically expand the U.S. House and introduce proportional representation: did you know the current size of the House hasn't changed in almost 100 years? Yes, you read that correctly, as America's population has grown and diversified, the House has stayed fixed at 435 members. This is deeply concerning, because many overlooked communities in America today don't feel they have adequate representation. The solution is to expand the current House from 435 members to 735. Most importantly, all members will no longer be elected in ""winner take all"" districts but instead will be elected through a proportional system. The lines of these congressional districts will be drawn either by a non-partisan commission or by an A.I. process that attempts to make the districts as competitive as possible. Gerrymandering will be outlawed; state legislatures will no longer have the authority to draw the boundaries of congressional districts. House members will only be permitted to serve three two year terms.

Reforming the Executive Branch

1. Presidents will be elected by a nationwide popular vote, the Electoral College will be abolished. That is all.

Expanding Voting Rights

1. Federal legislation needs to be passed that would require states to, among other things: make Election Day a national holiday, require same day voter registration for federal elections, expand the voter franchise to convicted felons (states will no longer be allowed to deny felons the right to vote), expand opportunities for vote by mail, require all states to have at least two weeks for early voting, reform the campaign finance system by incorporating a public financing option, reform provisions from the [DISCLOSE Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DISCLOSE_Act),[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_the_People_Act#cite_note-nytimes-11)[\[24\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_the_People_Act#cite_note-RuaneGill-24) which would impose stricter limitations on foreign lobbying, require [super PACs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_action_committee#Super_PACs) and other ""[dark money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_money)"" organizations to disclose their donors, and restructure the [Federal Election Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Election_Commission) to reduce partisan gridlock.

 Last week, 31-year-old Christy Bautista of Harrisonburg, Va., was [killed at the Ivy City Hotel](https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/virginia-woman-killed-in-stabbing-inside-hotel-room-in-northeast-dc/3321310/) in Washington, D.C., where she was staying to attend a concert.

 In October, Sydnor was charged with armed robbery, which was reduced to  an attempted robbery charge to which he pleaded guilty. He has a  criminal history going back to 2000, as he was previously convicted of  several felonies and misdemeanors such as rape, domestic violence, and  armed robbery, according to media reports and court records. 

 Following his October arrest, a [judge denied Sydnor bail](https://freebeacon.com/latest-news/biden-judge-released-man-accused-of-d-c-hotel-murder-from-jail-in-december/)  because of his criminal history. However, D.C. Superior Court Judge  Sean Staples, a Biden appointee, later took over Sydnor's case and  released him from jail in January, [according to court documents](https://eaccess.dccourts.gov/eaccess/search.page.3.1?x=I9QOj7oFwKRL9sz7W3Tvcxxxg5m7PDmauwblmf2c9Xmjma8BG*f-2TNP4a*0RniPeSn2KJSRh*YiVnvhPmQieQ).
