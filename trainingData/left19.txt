Should focus of Democrats in the upcoming election be saving the US from becoming a Christian theocracy? Because that is what Republicans are trying to do
We see the evangelical cult hijacking the Republican party and imposing their religious beliefs upon society. First they targeted womenâ€™s right to choose, now they are targeting the LGBT community, all in the name of Christianity. They claim Christians are targeted. The whole US is sick of Christofascism and religious zealotry. The Democrat main focus should be fight against Christian theocracy, and return to Medieval church dominance. The people of the US are generally against Christofascism and religious dominance, they want secular state. The Democrats need to make sure people are aware that Republicans want Christian theocracy and their main focus should be fighting against it.
