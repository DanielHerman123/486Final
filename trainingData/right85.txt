Stormy Daniels Story plot hole
Am I crazy - I just watched Stormy Daniels on Pierre Morgan tell him a story about her asking Trump about his hair because "at the time Trump was in a bet with Vince Mcmahon on WWE".

The WWE episodes were in April 2007 and she allegedly had sex with him in June 2006?

This is just all totally fake?
